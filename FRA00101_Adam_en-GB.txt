I
A WEEKEND.
For countless winters, Norine Duclos's house has been the venue for our village's most lively evenings. So one evening, as I entered Norine's house, I found her preaching to her three little girls.
- Hey, Tangerine," she shouted, "hurry up and sweep the house! Don't forget the corner where Jean-Claude's wife peeled an apple this morning. You, Rose, take my incubator and fill it up. Clever [2] , clever.
Désirée! Climb up the stepladder and take a candle from the beam; find the candlestick. There's copper shining like the back of a pumpkin. Rub it, rub it; there! I'm sorry, Cellier," said Norine, "but little girls don't take the slightest hint, you have to order them to do everything.
When it comes to housewives, that's one of them! She's rightly considered the most discerning housewife in Saint-Brunelle; you'd look into her walnut cupboard just as you would in front of a mirror, and I warn you that the pewter cutlery that hangs from her potter's tray shines as bright as gold.
shine like pure silver.
You know, it's hard to find three girls like Armandine, La Rose and Désirée in a palace.
Apart from the Rose, who seems to me a crumb too small for a country girl, Norine's little girls are capable in many ways.
While her sisters glory in watching the fire clink [3] , the Rose glory in going for a walk followed by a bunch of gallants.
No matter how little she may have been, she was always considered a tomboy; but even so, like her uncle Jean-Claude, she's not the dumbest girl in the house.
At the end of the day, the house fills up; the sewers sit as close as possible to the candle, the spinners behind the sewers, and the knitters anywhere. They gossip about all sorts of things, and tongues are wagging like the spinning wheels of the best spinners.
- Winter will come without orations, says the shepherd Father Roux, as he trots his needles faster than his sheep [4] .
- Shut up, you old Huguenot," said the little girl to Perpétue, "you only know how to offend the good Lord.
- What are you singing there? Psalms? Save them for the priest. There's Jean-Claude. Good evening, Jean-Claude!
- Good evening, brother," said Norine.
- Good evening, all," said Jean-Claude. Guess who's been following me? Basset and his wife, who kissed each other at the door as if they were white bread.
- Here's proof that you can still love each other in marriage," said Father Roux's son, a shepherd, in La Rose's ear.
I'm of the opinion, however, that the Bassette is planed like the boards of your late father, who was a wheelwright; it's not like you.
And, by way of flattery, he took the little girl by the arm.
Assured that the moment was ill-chosen. La Rose has never been known for her endurance; she turned away from Gaspard and gave him a beautiful pair of five-leaf wallflowers.
- How many candles?" said the mischievous girl, showing her tiny teeth.
- Thirty-six!" said Gaspard without flinching. So many candles, so many kisses, and paid in cash, it's only fair.
Everyone got up from their chairs to see which of the two would win.
- Defend yourself, La Rose! cried the white hats.
- Bold, Gaspard!" shouted the gods.
No matter how much Norine's daughter struggled, Gaspard, who was as strong as a barnstormer, counted thirty-six good-natured kisses on her neck, her eyes and her mouth.
Everyone laughed, except for Jacqueline, because she felt a kind of weakness towards Gaspard.
The lad Denis, while holding one of Norine's daughters, Désirée, his betrothed, by the waist, said to the mother Leroy, in order to talk about something:
- Hey old lady, sing conscription; you've got to sing, otherwise we'll never get out of debt.
- No, no," said Désirée quickly, cutting off her promised friend; "we'll always sing that song quickly enough.
Don't you draw lots every year?
- I forbid people to sing about conscription," said Father Roux, "it would make me think of my Gaspard for the same reason.
- You're right," said Jacqueline, staring at Father Roux.
But Gaspard was staring at the Rose, and the Rose was staring at the door to see if the schoolmaster's god, Pierre, the dragon, would come in.
Pierre is a tall, handsome man, brilliantly dressed and back from the army for a while, on leave.
- Sing, you, Rose," said Jean-Claude; "the dragon will come in the meantime.
- On the contrary, I want to wait for him so I can sing," said the Rose in a piqued tone.
- Sing," said Gaspard, "or else...
- You're getting too brave, little Roux," said Norine; "try to behave yourself.
- I'm going to sing," said the old shepherd.
- In that case, I'll run away," said the little girl to Perpétue.
- No," said Toinon, her promised son; "if it's too loud, you'll plug your ears. You stay.
- Bad bigot," said Jean-Claude, "you listen to a lot of Latin.
So here, if you'd like to learn it, is the song of the old shepherd:
Jeanneton takes her sickle
And goes to cut rushes,
But when her boot was done She fell asleep all the way.
Why did little Jeanneton fall asleep?
Why did she fall asleep, Little Jeanneton?
But when her boot was done, She fell asleep all the way.
Three famous horsemen passed by her.
Why did she fall asleep, Little Jeanneton?
Three famous riders passed by her.
The first put his foot down And looked at her cute foot.
Why did she fall asleep?
Little Johnny?
The first dismounted and looked at his cute foot.
The second was less shy,
He kissed her under the chin.
Why did she fall asleep?
Little Jane Doe?
The second was less shy,
He kissed her under the chin.
But what the third did...
Is not mentioned in the song!
Why did she fall asleep?
Little Jeanneton?
- Remember that one, hey! little Perpétue," said Father Roux, the shepherd; "you can sing it in the month of Mary.
- Have you finished soon?" said Mother Remblay. In our country, we wouldn't let you destroy religion like that.
- In your country, mother," said the old shepherd, "we're even more God-fearing than here; there's nothing to be proud of! a country where they don't speak anything but French.
- What do you mean, they don't speak French here? Vermand is only twenty leagues from here.
- I maintain that Vermand is outside France! Well, since we're singing, sing in your own language, Mother, and we'll see," says Père Roux.
- Sing, sing, let's sing!" said the dragon as he closed the door. Good evening to everyone.
- Good evening, Pierre [5] , said the company:
Mother Remblay began to sing a song in her beautiful, piercing voice. Here is the refrain; understand if you can:
Ch' solé y r'luit, ch' moinet y cainte,
Ch' mouguet flourit, ch' lépène s'épanouit ;
V'nez, m'tiote caille, v'nez, n'eussiez pau de crainte,
V'nez dans nos bous, tout y sourit,
V'nez dans nos bous sous leu n'ombrache,
You're a bachelette, you're with us;
If you had a crumb of courache,
Y foët rud'ment dous dans ché bous [6] .
That's how they talk to each other around Saint-Quentin; but what the hell!
The retreat sounded nine o'clock. The white bonnets pulled nuts, apples and bread from their pockets. Boys and girls clack their jaws together.
Father Nom-de-Nom, the former poacher, now our rural warden, entered at the same moment.
- Good evening, everyone," he said.
- We must get him to tell us his story about the fox," said Father Roux to Jean-Claude, "it will amuse us; what's more, it might encourage the dragon to see something of himself.
- Come on, war stories," said Jean-Claude, "you always know enough to sadden the poor world.
- said the old shepherd; and then he shouted: Hey, Father Nom-de-Nom, come here; we want to hear your story about the fox.
- Ah, it's you, wizard," said the country warden, "the devil's knitter, Father Slipper-Sock; I'm willing, my friend, if it would be agreeable to society.
I think it would be a good idea to tell you that Sylvain, as he was called, was dared to be nicknamed Father Nom-de-Nom, because, in the middle of his words, that swearword
came up again and again.
Everyone knew that the gardener needed room when he told his story about the fox. The story in question had been heard in many, many happy companies; it had been heard, and people liked to hear it of renewal, in relation to the action and the air.
action and the air of truth that Father Nom-de-Nom put into it.
As a result, the chairs came so close together that the girls and their lovers did not complain, except for Gaspard, who thought the dragon was too close to the Rose.
- We could," said the country warden, "have been around All Saints' Day; it was freezing cold. Even so, I think, you've got to winterise, for crying out loud! I whistle to Médor, I take my rifle, I load it with bullets, I light my pipe, a cheeky pipe, there's no such thing (poor pipe! I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life). So off I go. Once I got to the Carrière-Fondue, I planted myself behind a clump of thorns, opposite the burrows; I waited an hour; two hours went by; by golly! I was starting to freeze solid. These werewolf foxes, I thought to myself, have they become cold and cosy? So, as my pipe was getting deeper and deeper, I quietly started stuffing it again. Hush! There's a fox showing its nose. I beat the lighter and stopped. My finot looked left and right and came out of his hole a little. My pipe was rattling in my mouth; I had my joke open, my cap under my arm, my gun in one hand and my rifle in the other. The fox fell and I jumped on him, but... I saw him staring at me like that, with two eyes shining like furolles. Was he dead? Wasn't he? Foxes are clever, they make the dead look dead and they'll jump out at you without warning! Still carrying my rifle, my joke, my débourroir and my cap, I approached...
- What have you done with your lighter?" said Father Roux.
- I was holding it in one hand.
- And your tinder box?
- With the other.
- But your rifle, your joke and your clam shell?
- With my other hand.
- Ah, your third hand," said the old shepherd, flashing his little wizard's eyes.
- Even so!" said the country warden. I jumped on my fox, I grabbed his tail; my dog got stuck in my legs. What an embarrassment! Was he dead? Wasn't he? I turned him round and round. Was he dead? Was he not? I turned him, I...
- Enough!" shouted Jean-Claude; it's beginning to make sense.
- You're talking about a man in terrible trouble," said Norine.
- Ah, I think so," said Father Nom-de-Nom; "so listen! The one of my hands that was guarding my rifle, and then my joke, and then my cap, and then my débourroir, no the one...
I'm getting bogged down! That hand, or another one, suddenly found itself stupid with cold. My rifle fell, the second shot went off, and that was the worst of it! My fox revived, jumped aside and ran off at a triple gallop, leaving me his tail as a token. I yawned to see clearly. What's more, and this is as true as I can tell you, as he was about to enter his hole, he looked at me with a look that meant: "You're well on your way with my tail!
- So your fox had a false tail? said the dragon.
- Even so!" said the field warden in a proud voice, "you forget, dragon, that my second shot could without a miracle have cut off this tail of misfortune! As for me, what a bummer! I tumble into the quarry with my feet in the air, and my pipe breaks, by Jove!
- I bet you've never heard of a story like that," says Jean-Claude, laughing as hard as he can with one apiece.
- I wouldn't dream of entertaining the world with a story like that! I wouldn't stand up to the competition.
Enough!
- Perhaps," said the Rose kindly; "you should hear what I have to say.
- Yes, you should hear," said Father Roux. Come on, come on, Pierre, let's go!
- If it's war stories," said the village warden, "I'm leaving; it would make me think of my poor son they killed... Such a good worker! Your promise, Armandine, don't forget it... right away, my daughter, it would be a mortal blow to me.
And Father Nom-de-Nom wept as he said this.
- Don't worry," said Armandine, wiping her eyes; "these are things that don't need to be ordered.
With that, the priestly guard headed for the door.
Military men are beautiful, as La Rose says; but that doesn't stop the world from looking at them all the time without having a big heart, especially fathers and mothers.
- It's time for me to go back, for fear of the revenant," says mère Remblay. I don't see my man coming!
- Go, go, mother," said Jean-Claude, "and let him know, this evil ghost, that before long, faith of a Huguenot! I'll demolish him.
- Be careful, cousin," said La Remy, "you mustn't make fun of spirits; they appear to you everywhere, and...
- Bah! la Remy," said Father Roux, "it's never your spirit that will pursue us; we can rest assured, if you die, it will never come back night or day.
- You ill-educated old man!
- Mischievous!
The words were starting to come out badly; I said like this, to keep Father Roux, the shepherd, quiet:
- The parish priest of Morlincourt is going to leave, do you know that? and as a result of an adventure that will hardly surprise anyone.
Father Roux, a shepherd, and then Norine's brother, who rightly
rightly considered to be Huguenots, turned quickly to my side.
- As a result of what?" said Jean-Claude.
- Norine," I said, "give me permission to tell what I have to tell, because it could, I think, split the ears of the devotees.
- Story, Cellier," said Norine; "you can, without sin, say a word about black dresses, especially when there's something to say. My late father and Jean-Claude's father, who had seen the priests in other times, taught us to talk about them from time to time.
- Good evening company," said the little girl to Perpétue; "we'll meet again tomorrow.
- So here's the story I was told: of all the parish priests in the area, the jolliest was, without a doubt, the parish priest of Morlincourt; he drank well, liked to feast, wasn't proud at all, and preached to the men and the white bonnets not to wear out both knees in the confessional. "The good Lord gives life so that we may live," he often repeated. It follows that, outside rather than in church, the parish priest of Morlincourt grew like a field of wheat in full sun. He was becoming plump, plump and paunchy.
It has to be said that while little girls often met him on their way home from work, husbands never found him talking to their wives about the Blessed Virgin Mary.
There's no denying that he liked to make young people dream, but he knew better than any of us how to respect marriage.
In the midst of all this, the parish priest of Morlincourt remained a man like any other; something bad was bound to happen to him.
So when Mlle Léonie, his cousin and maid, put on her grey Sunday best, even though she was old enough to be a maid and a priest's legitimate cousin, she could still say a few words. But there are some people who are just unlucky, and here's a good example. On the very day of the Bishop's annual visit to Morlincourt, a little Christian boy was born in the rectory. You can judge from the aria. It is said that the lord bishop flew into a rage of the five hundred devils, and that some people heard him shout:
- Go home, priest! This is unforgivable. You will leave the commune!
- That poor parish priest from Morlincourt!" said one person, "he's so articulate, such a good man! We don't know; perhaps instead of being a bad priest he would have made a good husband.
- Stories about priests are a dime a dozen!" said Father Roux; "but I always lean towards the story of my late great-uncle:
Didn't he once find my late great-aunt in conversation (to speak well in front of the white bonnets) with the collector of tithes in her village. There was hardly any justice for a simple shepherd in those days. By shouting loudly, my late great-uncle could see himself hanged, that's all. So he decided to pretend to laugh. Better still, on the spot, he ordered his wife to cook some waffles. There's a way of doing things. Two hours later he took the priest back to his bed, stealthily, in the dark of the night. The next day happened to be a Sunday. My comrades, in the village, the most bigoted were forced to go without mass, because the priest was, with all due respect, dead.
De profundis!
- De profundis!" repeated Jeacquet, who had just entered. You're talking about a dead priest? May the good Lord have mercy on his soul!
- He needs it after all," said La Rose.
- You're becoming too scurrilous, La Rose," said Jeacquet, "you'll turn out badly.
- I can see by my stars that it's already late, let's get out of here," said the old shepherd. As for you, Rose, I hope Jeacquet's word doesn't bring you bad luck!
II
THE ROSE.
By dint of paying her lovers, "listening if it rains" [7] and seeing them come anyway, the Rose became a little too acrimonious; proud as Artaban, she deluded herself into believing that she would always be equally feted.
So the boys, to get her to fall asleep, could think of nothing better than talking about marriage. I don't think it was a lack of reflection that made these young people refuse to marry. Proof of this is that the little girl sometimes claimed that, in our countries, a married woman and a beast of burden are more or less the same thing. So there's never any rush to get a rope around your neck and, with all due respect, have five or six kids.
Norine used to say, when she was reminded of all the parties her daughter had rejected: "I'm sure we'll have to wait for Monsieur Plaisant.
For a few weeks, from the knowledge that everyone had of the Rose's way of being, it was easy to notice that she liked to banter less about marriage, and that on Sundays, unlike in the past, she went wandering in the meadows with just one gentleman.
That gentleman was none other than Pierre le dragon.
Norine's daughter had suddenly adopted him.
Some people quipped that she only chose him because of his costume. You have to admit that a lot of white coats have a sort of weakness for anything that tarnishes. Explain that.
Our schoolmaster didn't take kindly to Pierre's friendship with La Rose, who in our country was rightly considered a flirt. One day he said to his son:
- Pierre, take care of your good friend; I can see her eyes
the perdition of her soul. This young lady will never be a famous worker; after all, I'd be upset if anything were to happen to her.
- That's just to pass the time," replied the dragon, "and, what's more, it's well known that the Rose has never bothered with a living soul.
This was boldly true.
So as soon as the evening was over, instead of returning to his father's house as usual, Pierre set off up the mountain. When the last candle was blown out, he retraced his steps, went back through the village, skipped a hedge here and there, and only pretended to stop, guess where? in Norine's courtyard. Just like me, well you'd think that there was, given and agreed, a rendezvous.
The dragon stood guard for a quarter of an hour, on the same clock as the others.
the clock of the others, but after ten minutes he began to swear in a fine
ten minutes, he started swearing profanely, thinking he'd been there for two long hours. If you've ever waited for the same reason, you wouldn't dare blame him.
Gently, at the end of the end, the Rose opened the door of her room. With his ear to the wind, Pierre walked straight to the noise; the night was pitch black. So, looking carefully, our two lovers met. The dragon, in fear of losing his good friend, threw both his arms around her neck; and then, as a distraction, he kissed her like white bread.
This young woman, I assure you, no longer struggled as she did with Gaspard; still less did she shout. I think she was even afraid that Pierre would count those kisses.
- Why," said the girl to Norine, "did you ask me here this evening?
The dragon seemed to want to and then not to want to declare himself. The time passed giving and returning countless kisses, so well and so beautifully that the Rose was forced to ask again:
- Why did you send for me?
Pierre made up his mind and said, all at once:
- Around five o'clock I received my order to leave; it seems that things are getting confused. Some people claim that we're to be sent back against those we helped in the past; we're not given any explanations, we're shouted at: Forward! and we've got to march with our arms around our necks; that's what it is to be a soldier!
La Rose began to cry. Then, wiping her eyes, she said:
- This morning I swatted two big spiders, and Mummy saw the fire whistling to the right of our rack.
And the poor little girl started crying again, as if she really got paid for it.
- I don't like weak women," said the dragon; "let me have my courage. Here, my Rose, I give you the engagement ring; take it and put it on your finger. Don't be flirtatious or engaging; never forget me. Will you still love me when I come back, say, say, my Rose?
- Oh yes, I promise. Never... always..." said the little girl through her sobs. I couldn't forget you, even if I tried, because I love you, Pierre, I love you to my heart's content.
But you? you, over there, you will forget me in your garrisons; you will perhaps court other young women... Oh, that idea worries me more and more. I don't want, like some women, half a loyalty; I need the whole of it, do you hear? like the one I'm going to keep for you. Swear to me, Pierre, on all that is most sacred, swear to me...
- I swear to you, if you do not deceive me, that I will take you as my wife when I return, I swear it," said the dragon.
- You either love me or you don't, and if you love me, you must think only of me; I want you to swear me your complete loyalty. I've heard too many stories from the old-timers about the way you soldiers are.
Swear, Pierre, and hurry up.
- As for loyalty like the one I want you to keep for me, I don't dare swear it to you," said the dragon, who revered his own word; besides, a man isn't the same thing.
- And why is that?" said the girl to Norine, who was a fine fly and was greatly shocked by the last words of her promisee.
- Oh, don't be upset, my Rose," said Pierre; "I'll explain it to you and you'll understand. In the garrisons, you see, you get so bored that if you didn't have some semblance of particularity, you'd gnaw your spleen, not to mention that the comrades wouldn't hesitate to pursue you, night and day, with their mockery. You have to admit, you find yourself being pushed time and again to gossip about the loves of the country.
But I can't think of anything better to say to you, my Rose:
There's the heart that cries when you leave your country, your friends, your fiancée, your parents, and then there's the heart that jumps at the sound of the drum and the gunfire. The one that jumps under the uniform drives the other down; but the peasant's heart is found again when he sees his country, his friends, his parents, his fiancée...
La Rose felt something was wrong and said:
- Why, my Pierre, if you have two hearts, shouldn't I enjoy having two too? Do you think that when one of my lovers kisses me by surprise, if my heart beats, it beats in the same way as when you take me? No. Well, let my lovers come back when you are over there, far away; if they compliment me on my face, my malice or my work, I will listen to them. I also believe, Pierre, that we have two hearts, and I'll keep the one you keep for me.
Love, as some people claim, doesn't make you change at all, since, as you can see, this little girl had remained as feisty as ever.
Having answered, the Rose ran towards her room, pushing Pierre away from her as he approached.
The dragon shouted so loudly: "I need both your hearts!" that Norine's daughter stopped for fear of waking the neighbours.
- From what saint," she said, "do you want to demand of me what you don't want me to demand of you?
- Because a woman," said the dragon, in a commanding voice, "must give whatever is asked of her.
- Well," said the Rose, mocking, "you'd go a long way from that. Bah! bah! the more you give, the more you ask, and if the bonnets blancs had a shred of reason, I don't think we'd make them go so often. So, since we're chatting, let's go to my room; it's not very hot outside either. Seeing the ring of promise on my finger, my mother herself, if she woke up, wouldn't mind the freedom I'm letting you take.
And they went inside; but to light her candle, the Rose was afraid of disturbing Norine by going to stir the ashes in the house. So Pierre took from his pocket one of those chemical matches that soldiers always carry with them. When it was light, the dragon looked around proudly. He was in a room that no boy could boast of knowing, although to tell the truth it wasn't what you'd call a nice room. There was a small wardrobe, a chair, a bed, a picture of sanctity on the wall, and in one corner a pile of hemp. Whether it was the smell of hemp or something else, the blood rushed to the dragon's head and he sat down, all emotional, on the chair, while the Rose rested on the edge of his bunk.
- You maintain, Pierre," said the little girl, "that white bonnets owe more friendship and loyalty to men than men owe to white bonnets. I agree that this is due to equality, because without that there would hardly be any justice, and I would like, for everything to go well in the world, for those who deceive to always be deceived.
- You speak like the parish priest," said Pierre; "but that doesn't stop a dishonoured girl from always being blamed much more than the boy who did her wrong.
- I blame the boy more," said La Rose.
I think that if some of us have a bit too much coquetry, some of you have too much bravery, and if you made it a law to indoctrinate girls instead of taking them by force of arms, we would not hear of so many misfortunes in our countries. To finish on that subject, give me your soldier's heart, Pierre, and I'll give you my coquette's heart.
- Tope!" said the dragon; well, with women you never get the last laugh, and if we are a little stronger than they are, we can boldly maintain that they are cleverer than us on many points. You are right, my fine Rose, both men and women should give and ask equally.
equality. Then, rising from his chair, Pierre went to kiss his betrothed.
- You're strangling me," said the Rose, laughing, "finish it off! So you're giving me your two hearts, of course... I swear, I swear.
- It's sworn, sworn.
- Here!" cried the Rose, "we're going to be buried; I've got no more candles, let's go out, my Pierre; I'll go and show you the way; just finish!
- Rose, do you love me?
- Pierre," said the Rose in a confident voice, all emotional at the same time, "ask me if I respect my mother, if I miss my late father; but come, come!
- I'm leaving tomorrow, my Rose, my betrothed, my wife; just a moment more!
- Pierre, leave me alone, go away... !
III
THE PARIGOTS [8] .
Thérèse's parigot, Jean-Claude's wife, had had an unnatural cough during the night.
Early in the morning, Norine's brother got dressed to go and fetch the doctor.
- Hey cousin," shouted Toinon, the grocer, as she saw him pass.
Do you go from here to Morlincourt? You walk very proudly. Can't you say hello to people? What's so urgent that you don't take a quarter of an hour to look around and chat with friends?
- I'm off to Morlincourt as quickly as possible," said Jean-Claude, "to fetch Mr Céran; our parigot is dangerously ill.
Toinon stood in her doorway and, in an attempt to mock her, she put both fists on her hips.
- Here's something new," she said. Oui-da! Claude le lettré, you're taking your money to the doctor for a parigot. With your fifteen francs a month, you can really pay for visits. Don't you have to be mad as a hatter?
I think it would be a good idea to explain Toinon's shock when he saw Jean-Claude going to Morlincourt, in relation to
parigot. So I'm forced to tell you that in my country the parigots are treated no better, with all due respect, than those dressed in silk. They are fed on rubbish, covered in bits and pieces; some survive, queussi-queumi; but those who escape the cold, the dirt, the bad milk, the diseases, you don't need a pile of stones to count them.
In my opinion, when the gravedigger passes by with a small box under his arm, he replies, a little too often, to questions from the white bonnets on the right and left: "It's nothing, he's a parigot!
Jean-Claude cut inland; he wanted to get to Morlincourt
Morlincourt early, before Mr Céran's round. By pure chance, he met our doctor at the Feuillants.
- I'm more comfortable than I should be at the moment," Jean-Claude told him; "I've got a great chance of catching you like this; I'm not letting you go; you've got to come and see our parigot, who's very ill, right away. Thérèse and I are very worried.
Mr Céran fell to his feet, took Jean-Claude's hand, and a look of real contentment showed on his brave face.
- It's good, my friend Jean-Claude," he said, "you should have been the first to give me this happiness, yes happiness. Would you believe that I've never been called a parigot?
Norine's brother, replaying in his mind Toinon's words and a lot of other things, said sadly:
- The fact is that some people could be taken more pity.
- Yes, people are moved when they hear of the miseries and sufferings of unknown people and foreign slaves, they shout out their devotion to distant causes, they display their charity on agreed days.
torture, would we perhaps hesitate? Some people deny these tortures when, with a broken heart, I recount them. But they are all too real, alas! I see them all the time; feeling them all the time, I have not been able to harden myself to them. I, a poor country surgeon, am powerless to relieve them.
If you knew the hatred that germinates in the souls of these little wretches, repressed, demeaned, rejected, hated, you would feel fear or pity. Ah, my dear parigots, who will love you with me?
And Jean-Claude and M. Céran turned away from each other, afraid to let anyone see that they were crying.
When Jean-Claude had recovered his breath, he said something like this:
- Speaking of parigots, I'll always remember the ones your father-in-law brought to our house.
I was still very small, and it was freezing cold; the family was standing very close to the fire, the shoots were blazing dry, and it was getting late. Now we're burning wood at the door, while it's still hot enough.
Our mother went out of her way, shouting: Open up! and your father-in-law came in carrying in his arms two parigots wrapped up in his coat. He had found them in the woods, naked, the poor little ones, on dry leaves, in the middle of January.
You couldn't tell they were human, and they screamed like real animals. My brothers and sisters, myself included, shrank back in fear. Our mother said to us:
- My little ones, don't turn away, they're God's creatures, just like you.
- Every day there's something new," said Mr Céran, as if thinking of
many things. These days, I went to see the shepherd at Favette; his wife was a bit ill, so I examined her. Suddenly I
Suddenly I heard terrible screams coming from a neighbouring room. -
What is it?" I asked. - It's nothing," replied the shepherdess; "it's a parigot!
- Yes, but," said Jean-Claude, "since our mayor, we haven't seen so much misery.
- Come on! She's up to no good. Last month she tried to take back the parigot from the Jeacquet woman, a wretch who let it burn for the sixth time. The parigot had to be returned. Jeacquet, a devout woman, got the priest to intervene and threatened the mayor with a complaint to the gendarmes; the mayor was afraid, as always.
- I abominate that Jeacquet," says Jean-Claude, "she's lazy. Yesterday, in broad daylight, wasn't she strolling through the village with her little one in full dress! Just imagine that the leader [9] had given her a bundle of nipples for her little parigot, and she went off showing off these nipples on the back of her own child, while the infant was dragging himself, all in tatters, in front of her door. Talking about the mayor again, it's not her fault if she doesn't do well.
- That's true," said Mr Céran, "but what can a woman do, what right does she have?
- The right given to her by her great kindness," said Jean-Claude; "do you remember what she did for the parigote?
- Oh, that," said the doctor in an emotional voice, "is one of those acts that illuminate a whole life.
I can assure you that you don't know the story of the parigote.
While Jean-Claude and Mr Céran are talking, I'll tell you:
La parigote, Maria's nurse, found herself motherless and abandoned by her own father after three months as a nurse. Maria kept her anyway, using her as best she could in her witchcraft and sending her to beg for bread on the highways. Burnt on one side, lame, malnourished, badly dressed, dirty to the hilt, the village children booed her incessantly. The grown-ups turned away from her as if in disgust.
She was rightly considered to be lazy, thieving, surly, and trying to do the wrong thing in everything and everywhere.
Madame la mairesse, would you believe it? supported her boldly, called her into her own home, and spoke words of friendship to her every time she met her.
- You're wasting your time, our mayor," everyone kept saying, "she's laughing at you from behind. A parigote, by the way, can be no good. Our mayor isn't discouraged by so little! She moralized about the little girl, without worrying about what she said.
She got her to work for the local tailor as a wheel-turner, but on the second day, the parigote planted the tailor and wandered off again.
Madame la mairesse did not admit that she had been beaten; she went up to the quarries and caught the fugitive. I can't tell you what she put into the parigote's mind; all that's said is that she felt brave enough to embrace such filth, and when the little girl saw this, she was so moved that she threw herself at the mayor's knees and promised her heaven and earth.
By now we've seen that the parigote has a heart like any other, and we're wondering on the sly if it was right to put her off so much. Last night the mayor was talking about marrying her off in good time to the little Savoyard boy.
I think it would be a good idea for you to learn the history of this Savoyard too:
In the village, as in the town, it is customary to sweep the chimneys. They work under the orders of those they call their masters - often bad masters! who beat them like plaster, let them freeze from the cold and starve to death. It's a really tough job, especially in our villages, because there are no gendarmes to defend the poor kids.
The one I'm talking about was rescued by our mayor. He was dying of exhaustion and hunger in a barn, alone, like a leper. Our mayor had the charity to buy him back from his master, for the sum of fifty francs; then she nursed him back to health. The boy has a good heart, he's honest, hard-working and very tidy.
Doesn't it seem to you that the "parigote" and the Savoyard would be a good match?
Coming back to Jean-Claude and Mr Céran, they were still talking, walking side by side.
- Come on, Mr Céran," said Jean-Claude, "it would be better if our mayor were the mayor of the commune.
- It's not up to her," said our doctor, "to preside over your town council, or to oversee the repair of your roads; but the truth is, she would have a thousand other things to do in the commune, and just as useful, if she were mayor for good.
- You're talking about our roads, Monsieur Céran," said Jean-Claude, "and how they've been repaired! And how we can boast of being governed by a well-informed mayor. On that subject, I'll have to tell you again about a question we discussed with him yesterday at the council meeting. Since last year, we've been at loggerheads with the people of Morlinval over a spring that runs through their land. Didn't they have the idea, a year ago, to cut off the pipe to our fountain! You know that today women consult you about the lumps growing on their necks. You see that the water from Saint-Brunelle is harmful. It's all the fault of our mayor. He doesn't want to be sued at any cost, and what's more, he's having fun claiming that the water from our wells is preferable to the water from our spring.
I'll come back to the subject at hand. This old Huguenot, Father Roux, a shepherd, maintains that on several occasions he has lost sheep in the ruts. What's more, all the residents of the communal areas are encroaching at the drop of a hat. Ah, we've got a famous mayor on our hands, and my goodness, a clever white hat wouldn't go amiss to help us sort out our mess.
Here we are.
As Mr Céran was leaving Jean-Claude's, he was asked to come up to Norine's house. They said that La Rose had fallen into convulsions.
If you don't mind, I'm going to tell you my feelings about Mr Céran. I think I can show him as he is. He swears wholeheartedly, about nothing, and has no qualms about treating you from top to bottom. His first word when you disturb him, especially at night, is not always the one you want to hear.
If I had to tell you everything I know about him, I'd never finish; I'd rather tell you again that he's the cream of the crop. How he devotes himself to the poor world! Go on, go on! He won't ruin you with drugs, take him; his writings take you to the butcher's rather than the apothecary's; no one ever complains, because it's often through weakness that people fall ill in the village.
Our doctor is a great friend of Madame la Mairesse, and almost as charitable as she is, which is saying something.
If there's anything you need, he and she will find it for you, rest assured. Poor Mr Céran is much loved at Saint-Brunelle for many reasons.
He's a capable man, I assure you, whatever he says. À
to hear him tell it, it's hardly his fault that we're recovering.
Madame la mairesse warned us about our doctor's modesty, and Jean-Claude says that Madame la mairesse's word means that we must never praise Mr Céran.
IV
MONSIEUR LE CURE.
La Rose has been very ill. Everyone says that it was Pierre's departure that gave her this illness. Toinon, with a bad tongue that could make mountains beat together, tells those who want to listen that there is something more to this grief than simple sorrow. All the same, the Rose has suffered a great deal.
I don't want to be the echo of the malicious things said in secret about the daughter of
Norine's daughter last night at the wake.
If La Rose no longer has the right to be as proud as she used to be, I feel sorry for the poor little girl, she's not out of the woods yet!
The parish priest has heard about the gossip about the little girl. Last Sunday, he announced that he would preach against slander, as he calls the gossip of the people of Saint-Brunelle.
I'll go to that sermon, if you like, and I'll tell you word for word what will be said.
Our church isn't what you'd call a beautiful church; it's practically tiny, and I'm not complaining about that, as I only set foot in it every thirty-sixth day of the month.
If you ever go to Saint-Brunelle during the week, I warn you in advance, don't even think of visiting our church, because the parish priest might play the same trick on you as he did on a friend of our mayoress.
This stranger had entered our church to amuse himself and, walking at his usual pace, looked everywhere, right, left, up and down.
Suddenly our parish priest stepped out from behind a pillar and addressed our mayor's friend:
- Sir," he said, "have you come here to pray?
- Sir, I..." said the stranger, as if in embarrassment.
- Have you come to pray, yes or no?" said our priest again; answer.
- No, sir," said our mayor's friend frankly, "I came to see the church.
- Then, Sir," said our priest, "you have no business here; a holy place is not a public house. Go away!
Today is Easter in bloom; the white bonnets go to mass with their hands full of boxwood.
When they return, this blessed boxwood will be hung from the four corners of the houses, to protect them from all disasters.
But hush! I'm entering our church. Spit, blow your nose, sneeze! The parish priest is coming up to the pulpit, so be quiet. Listen, here's what he says:
"Evigilabunt alii in vitam æternam et alii in opprobrium.
"These words are taken from the door of our cemetery.
"My dear brothers!
"I'm going to tell you about hell, yes, hell! (First silence in the chapel of the Virgin! Do you hear, you chatterboxes?) Hell (do you want to be silent, once and for all?), hell, I say, hell is a place of torment established by divine justice to house and punish for eternity those who have offended the good Lord too much. Hell, my brothers, no, the fire of hell is a malignant fire which attaches itself to all the senses which have sinned, but which attaches itself principally to the one who has sinned most. Have you offended God by the sight of obscene objects, magic lanterns, masquerades, immoral images? you will be punished by sight, per visum! Have you been greedy, drunkards? have you spoken impious words, stained your lips with impure kisses, or slandered, yes, especially slandered your brothers? it is then and especially then that you will be punished by the mouth, the tongue and the lips, per labia, linguam, per gustum!
Have you also complacently lent an ear to the slander and speeches of the Huguenots? You will be punished through your ears, per auditum! Have your hands searched your neighbour's purse or violated the precepts of chastity? You will be punished by tact, per tactum! Finally, if you have been promiscuous, drunkards, envious, thieves, blasphemers, bad tongues, slanderers, slanderers! my brothers, what state will you be in in the next life? fire in the ears, fire in the mouth, fire in the limbs, fire everywhere!
"You people are laughing!
"Tonight, maybe tomorrow, you'll already be frying in the great cauldron!
"You're laughing! Do you know what hellfire is?
"Let's suppose that all of you, as many as there are of you here, were to tumble together at the same moment into hell, which could happen to any of you, although I wouldn't wish it on you. Well, the fire of hell would take hold of you all like a pile of towels.
Bjitt! bjitt!! bjitt!!! and there you are, roasted, just as roasted as the damned who have been there for six thousand years! Laugh now, you clever Huguenots of Saint-Brunelle!
At the priest's "bjitt!", all the white bonnets, believing they saw hellfire before their eyes, no doubt because most of them had one of those sins on their conscience, especially the sin of slander, started running as if that fire
and, apart from the parish priest, the church people and Jeacquet the liar, who was busy singing his Latin, everyone, including me, ran out of the church.
What do you think of our parish priest's sermon?
To get an idea of the parish priest, you need to know that he was a soldier. He has big eyes, big legs, a big nose and big arms.
He's a strong man who knows how to lend us a hand when the weather threatens to bring in food or wheat. What's more, you'll always see him first on the scene of a fire. Without malice, he's a seasoned firefighter. You could call him a good man, and the commune doesn't reproach him for his treatment. If there's a touch of religion in the village, it's more to do with the priest than the good Lord, I assure you.
All the same, as Jean-Claude says, you know a priest; if he's bad, you leave him there. But the good God we preach about, we can never be sure if he's really the good one, because we can only see him face to face after death and the dead never come back.
You may or may not know that Jean-Claude doesn't believe in ghosts; that he's a Huguenot, a God-denier!
He claims that in a commune you need roads more than you need a church, and that if it weren't for our parish priest, who is an honest parish priest, and the bonnets blancs, who still need religion for lack of use, we could let our church be ruined and do without a parish priest.
Jean-Claude maintains that the bonnets blancs still need religion for lack of custom, using as a pretext our mayoress who is so literate and who hardly goes to mass, vespers, confession or communion.
Getting back to the parish priest, don't laugh if you ever see him riding his donkey, his cane in his hand, and his big jigs dragging along the ground; don't laugh, he's a good man!
Don't laugh even if Miss Dorothée pulls her brother and his donkey in front of her; don't laugh!
V
THE GABLE'S LAWYER.
For a simple peasant, Jean-Claude knows a lot; he explains the leaf so beautifully and so well that we often see more clearly than we might think about the affairs of our government.
Although to tell the truth, when it comes to politics, most of us only ever see the issue of taxation.
In bad years, we are so hampered by these damned taxes that the poor people are flattered as soon as we make them think that they will pay less.
There's not much money to be made on this earth, and it's a small thing to live on, after having gone to a lot of trouble. We should, for pity's sake, look twice before bidding up the government.
When Jean-Claude rambles on too acrimoniously about this, I say to him like this: Bah! bah! let's hope that the day will come when we won't be so squeezed, because as far as I can see, we're already no longer paying tithes to the parish priests, nor the seigneur's rights, like our late grandfathers. Saint-Brunelle wasn't built in a day. If we shout a crumb too loudly, I recognise that we are put in prison for a small matter; but at least we are no longer forgotten, as in the past, beneath the moats of the great towers.
Jean-Claude sometimes reproaches me for seeing everything as beautiful.
I need to think that we're doing better and better; after all, I'm not literate, I must admit.
I'm chattering here like a one-eyed magpie. Even so, if my chatter bothers you, just pass it on.
Clarisse Manot's cabaret is clean enough for a village cabaret. All by itself, it holds up the front of the church; in fact, the parish priest supposedly talked about closing it during services. Let's not joke about it, da! Just a minute! We called the priest before the town council, and Jean-Claude said to him:
- Monsieur le Cure, you can preach to the white bonnets, that's your business; but as long as you're going to meddle in our commune as a rural warden, try not to get involved; with all due respect, Monsieur le Cure, things could end badly and go wrong. For God's sake, do your job, priest, but leave us alone.
Whether he was happy or not, the priest replied, seeming to laugh at us:
"If it's for the love of God, my children, that you want to keep your tavern open during mass, then so be it!
I'll even add, if you insist, drinking is praying.
And then it never came up again. You see, in our country, although the bonnets blancs like to go to mass, we're not crazy about religion. So, to tell the truth, there's never anyone at vespers but the parish priest, his sister, the schoolmaster, Perpétue's little girl, Jeacquet the liar, and Toinon's mother, who's deaf as a post.
The parish priest, seeing our cabaret full to bursting on Sundays, from morning till night, was a little jealous.
Clarisse Manot, the cabaret owner at Saint-Brunelle, is a rather appetising little woman. On a good day, with her buckled shoes, her well-tucked socks, her red raincoat, her flowered cap and her real silk marmot, she really looks like something, except for her neck which is beginning to swell, if you remember, purely due to the fault of our mayor.
So, on Easter Sunday in bloom, as I was entering the cabaret, Jean-Claude shouted at me from the other end of the room:
- Hey! lurot, come here.
- What do you mean, lurot?" I replied; I'm sure you're quite at ease talking about it. I don't have a white hat to help me, and it's not surprising if I'm one of the last to arrive.
- Go and sit down quickly," said Father Roux, the shepherd; Jean-Claude, our gable lawyer, was waiting for you to explain the leaf.
- So," said Jean-Claude, "things are getting out of hand; it's almost like Thérèse's reel some days; you'll have to break the thread.
- Thank God not," said Manot, Clarisse's man, who always thought he had to take the government's side; as the gendarmes were saying again the other day, our king is a clever one.
- What makes you think otherwise, you fool," continued Jean-Claude; "we're not talking about this man's wits; he's certainly clever, and so clever that I think he's having fun twisting other people's wits; we're telling you that business is getting out of hand and we're backing you up; shut up, Manot.
- Yes, shut up," said Clarisse, who was pouring me half a litre, "because Jean-Claude tells you that you don't see anything.
- Try, Manot, to keep your mouth shut," said Jean-Claude, "you who believe that the king of today is still the same king as before the revolution of 1830.
- Well," says Manot, "as if a king and then a king weren't always the same thing, in a way.
- You're right, Manot, without knowing it, a king, then a king, is always the same thing, in a sense; it's like a weaver and then a weaver, it makes warps and then wefts.
- That's exactly what I'm doing, as a weaver by trade.
- There's no comparison," says Jean-Claude, "between a weaver and a king, because a weaver makes cloth and a king makes contributions. Each to his own trade; you need weavers and then a government, whatever the cost: the government, to prevent the ill-intentioned from revolutionising at every turn; the weaver, to...
- Bah! I say, even if we were to revolutionise a bit from time to time, what's in it for us, for what we have to lose? and I even agree that we always gain a little something from revolutions.
- Yes, but," said Clarisse, who, although a white hat, could give her word freely with us, "what would those who have their money invested in the government do if there were no more kings? Take, for example, the master of our castle, and all the state annuitants. Come on, come on, we need a government, even if it's only for the rich; let's not preach so much to our own saint.
- Charity begins at home, Clarisse," I said.
- Well, then, revolutionise yourself, Cellier," she said, mocking me; neither your wife nor your children will stop you from following your idea.
- If I could be sure of finding a clever housewife like you, Clarisse," I said, taking her by the arm, "I might try to get married.
- No gallantry, no nonsense," says Jean-Claude; "let's talk little and well. You tell me that a peasant like me can't see very clearly in such comedies; I tell you again that the gazettes don't seem to have any more clarification.
- That doesn't stop us," said Father Roux, the shepherd, who always felt a sort of weakness towards the armies of war, "from admitting that we are skilful soldiers, and that, since the capture of Algiers, we know how to fight, no matter for whom or for what, even if it is in a pretty way, da!
- Bah! bah!" said the village warden, "soldiers aren't so pretty; don't they look like wild beasts? The proof is that Jean-Claude read us that the most savage fought the best. I've never been a coward, everyone knows that; but when I saw this war starting in Algiers, Sylvain's word, by golly! I was afraid.
- And you were right, Father Nom-de-Nom," said Jean-Claude; "there's a lot to be said about wars, for the learned, and even sometimes about kings.
- Long live the king!" said Jeacquet, who was always right on time to answer Amen.
- Long live the king!" said Manot, wanting to win Jeacquet's favour.
I said to Manot, understanding his intentions:
- Shut up, Manot, or we'll go and play politics in another inn.
Clarisse, the clever fly, sent her man a five-leaf wallflower.
and Manot left, whistling, to see if I was there.
VI
MADAME LA MAIRESSE.
Gaspard drags Jacqueline everywhere; guess why? You can't ignore it any longer, although it costs me to tell you: the Rose is pregnant!
Everyone agrees that this child
can only be Peter the Dragon's.
But the schoolmaster's son hasn't written a word to his bride since he left.
Come on, come on," said the village warden the other day, "the government doesn't have much pity on us. When it doesn't manage to
kill the bodies of our children, it kills their hearts, in order to make better soldiers of them. To fight well, you have to be as tough as nails, everyone knows that.
Everyone in the village is talking about Norine's daughter!
Poor youth! It hardly needed to be so backward in the past to find itself so downgraded today.
Virtue in our country, you learn, is supposedly a great thing.
Woe, woe to the white hat who forgets! No one in the village will spare him a scornful word or an insult.
Hide skilfully, girls of Saint-Brunelle, if you like to love all the way without the consent of our mayor and our priest; hide skilfully!
Go quietly, on dark nights, to your rendezvous, and, whatever the cost, take care never to bear the living fruit of your weakness: hidden sin is half forgiven.
Also, when such a scourge strikes you, poor girls, take care that no one notices; you could be driven to some act of despair, and, depending on your character, you could end up
You could be driven to some act of despair, and, depending on your character, you could end up leaving the country, living on hatred and brazenness every day, or even destroying yourself or your child.
Hide cleverly, girls! If you have a doubt or two, you can be defended; but if you have fallen visibly, don't count on anyone, not even your companions, you will get nothing but blame and malice; even better, if your friends from the past can, denying and tricking, clear up their faults for your benefit, they will accuse you, you can be sure of that.
Hide skilfully, you little girls! Because if you keep picking up rubbish from all the dunghills, people will end up getting in your way and, whatever you do, you'll end up tangled up and dirty for ever.
Girls, hide cleverly!
Jean-Claude, who supported his niece against all odds, was not short of battles, but he was as brave as the whole village combined.
Norine's daughter therefore found someone to talk to about her humiliations and, sooner or later, I can assure you that, with the help of her uncle, she would have been able to defend herself, even if it was only a crumb.
Désirée and Armandine, feasting with the devout, had ended up turning their mother's head against the Rose, so that the poor little girl was showered with misery, both inside and out.
One fine morning, Jean-Claude, seeing his sister's daughter in despair
desperate, decided to speak to the mayor.
He told her everything: Pierre's betrayal, the wickedness of the villagers and, as the final proof, that Mr Céran had just told him on the sly that if they didn't manage to raise Rose's spirits, the little girl would be dead within a month.
Who in the world could raise Rose's spirits and silence the bad tongues? Nobody, apart from the mayor.
- My good Claude," replied our mayor to the prayers of the distressed uncle, "I thank you for thinking of me. From now on I will act, and may my influence be as salutary as I wish!
- My Rose is safe!" said Jean-Claude as he left the mayor's house.
Around two o'clock in the afternoon, everyone in the village saw the mayor enter Norine's house.
When she saw her, the Rose, thinking that she was going to reproach her for her conduct, fell dead on the floor.
Madame la mairesse, who possessed in a tiny bottle the secret of reviving people, soon helped her to recover from her weakness, and immediately the good woman said, in the presence of Norine, Désirée and Armandine:
- Don't worry, Rose, I've come to offer you my hand; they told me you were discouraged.
- Oh, madame la mairesse," said Norine, flattered by the interest that a lady like madame la mairesse took in her daughter's misfortune, "she would have courage, if she still knew how to claim the friendship of honest people; but, today, she's a lost girl.
- Yes, lost!" said the Rose, weeping, "and despised forever.
- You exaggerate the fault, my child," said the mayor; "it's not that serious. I'm ready to forgive you. But I have conditions: I must find strength and confidence in you.
- Madam, madam," said Norine, "give him back his honour and courage, give him back the esteem of everyone, and we will bless you.
And poor old Norine threw herself and her three daughters at the knees of our mayor, repeating through her sobs:
- Save our honour, have mercy on us!
- Get up," said the mayor, crying in spite of herself.
Come on, my good friends, the Rose can still be respectable and respected, believe me; take courage, have confidence, and, since the approval and esteem of everyone are so necessary to you, I will help you regain that esteem and approval, believe me.
Since then, she has often brought books to Norine's house, and in the evening, when the Rose comes in from the fields, while Armandine, Désirée and their mother turn their spindles, Madame la Mairesse teaches her protégée how to sew.
There is no seamstress in Saint-Brunelle; for nothing at all you are forced to go to Morlincourt. I'm sure that if the Rose became skilled, she'd have as much work as she wanted.
I have to tell you that everyone sided with Pierre le dragon's mistress. We thought, you see, that our mayor would never support anyone who wasn't worth her salt.
Ah, it's just that the most ill-intentioned people would find neither a little nor a lot to say about our mayor's wife. So we respect her in every way, as you can well imagine. No living soul in our country could boast of ever having had recourse to her, such an obliging, charitable and well-read woman.
Although she is hardly devout, our parish priest much prefers her to the lady of the castle, because, as he says, everyone does good in his own way, and good is not evil; therefore, the good Lord requires good deeds rather than good clothes.
Since Toinon's little boy died suddenly from the sting of a coal fly, our mayor has set up a sort of pharmacy in the town hall.
Since the bonnets blancs are reprehensible for everything, our mayoress, for fear of failing the government, takes her drugs from the apothecary in Morlincourt, who sells at a very high price, but whom she is careful not to shock, for fear of quibbling.
Since we are on the subject of the kindness of our mayoress, you should know that, although she is not extraordinarily wealthy, she finds the means to help everyone, either with clothes, wine, meat, money or admonitions that cannot be listened to too much.
Because she's the wife of our mayor, she's supposed, in the eyes of the bonnets blancs, who don't know the laws, to have more rights than the others. We on the town council are well aware of this, but even so!
we let her do and order things, without having to bite our thumbs.
Our mayor, who doesn't concern himself with anything, finds nothing to
to take back.
But, as Jean-Claude said at the last meeting, we'll have to work things out so that we can change things again.
We'll sign, with the council in the lead, and then the leading men of the village, and then the bonnets blancs, all of us, a petition to the king of today, with the sole aim of legitimately appointing our mayor in the place of our mayor; moreover, we'll get the parish priest to put his scribble on it, and since he always says that it's the bonnets blancs who have lost the world, and that many people believe him, we'll force him to deny it, in relation to our mayor : once is not customary! 
If we're turned down, and then it's time for a bit of revolution...
you never know...
VII
CONSCRIPTION.
I'm going to talk to you about something that's not very cheerful, but even so, since I'm telling you everything, listen:
In the towns, you may be brave. But don't be in too much of a hurry to call us cowards! Think, apart from yourselves, how hard it must be when you leave your country, your work, your parents, your friends, your loves... Think about it. So don't ever accuse us when, in order to escape our fate, we do so much and more.
Some fathers and mothers, it's true, by dint of patience and courage, sometimes end up, penny by penny, sweat by sweat, amassing a sum sufficient to buy back a son: these are counted in our countries.
Others sacrifice their first-born to save their second, or their second to save their third. Those who devote themselves to others are quick to commit themselves for fear of losing out to a good number: this kind of act is not really uncommon around Saint-Brunelle.
It's sad, you know, when you've insured your stake in advance, in order to pay less, to see it go out with a good number.
What! All our money given away for nothing! If only we'd known!
Conscription! What a hailstorm for poor families. Every year, when it approaches, everyone moans out of forethought, fear or memory.
The gods, come on! hardly play the bravado. Who would believe their indifference? Can they leave without regret so many endearing things, so many habits, so many affections?
Fearful, the fatal day approaching, chased by danger, the poor little ones often commit reprehensible actions. I can give you one or two examples out of a thousand.
Last year, Mr Céran, returning from Morlinval, picked something up on the road. An hour later, the Morlinval shepherd's son came to see him about his thumb, which he said had been cut off accidentally. Mr Céran took what he had found out of his pocket: it was none other than the thumb in question.
Fallut had to do the operation all over again; just think of the pain!
On dark nights, you can often spot a young lad who, without making a sound, takes roundabout paths and sneaks into the mountain quarries: what is he looking for?
Near the Sainte-Radegonde fountain, in a black hole dug under the rock, nestles Maria, the witch. A skull and crossbones, a few filthy straw bales with four or five parigots rolling on them - that's all you see and meet in her kennel.
Some people claim that beasts of all colours and shapes roam around in this little place: it's in their minds that these beasts roam around; all I've ever seen is a simple raven.
The girls also go secretly to consult the witch on certain
and she gives them the herbs they need for a few pennies. As for the gods, they sell their souls to the devil in the hope of getting a good number.
He has the means to make you half-blind or deaf, by making you put on certain glasses or corner your ears in a certain way; the means to make you yellow as wax, by forcing you to swallow bad drugs; the means to cover your body with sores: all this for a time, until after the revision; at least he supports it.
But I know more than one guy who is still a leper, blind, deaf or sick to his stomach.
Last year, five were drawn from Saint-Brunelle.
Of the five, only one was discharged; he was so good at faking the idiot, the simpleton, that the majors never wanted him! As things stand today, all we have is Gaspard, little Denis and Toinon.
I'm going to Morlincourt, and I won't be the only one. First, Norine, Désirée and Jean-Claude will come for little Denis, who is promised to Norine's second; then Toinon, little Perpétue's daughter, her mother and the rest of the family.
Perpétue, her mother, her cousins, because of Toinon's farewell; the great Jacqueline and the shepherd Father Roux, with Gaspard; then others, like me, out of simple friendship or curiosity.
The big day had arrived. Little Denis, Gaspard, Toinon's son, are called by each of them to have a drink before leaving... Their brides tear white, red and blue ribbons from their caps, as is the custom. It's time to set off; the roads are full of people; the gods are singing at the top of their voices, shouting: Long live France! In my opinion, more than one person would gladly do without serving her in this way. Not everyone is brave, and I only blame those who want to appear so without being so. After that, there may be those who claim that for two sous a day, it is not all profit to give one's time, life and blood to the government.
If we believed that wars were undertaken with the sole aim of defending the country, the peasants, and what must be defended, we would be sure to do nothing, to leave as our grandfathers did without taking the time to put on our shoes, to leave with our clogs on!
So, because the name of our village begins with a B, we have to be the first to arrive.
All the same, it's a real thrill to see the fathers, mothers and pledges crying, singing, dancing and shouting when the boys come out with more or less good numbers. In my opinion, it's enough to make girls really attached to their lovers sick or crazy, and this can sometimes be seen, not knowing what fate has in store for them, and suddenly learning that the promised man is leaving for seven years, perhaps forever. Those with money know no such torture.
Two years ago, a fool from Morlinval, mad with contentment, waved the number one hundred and fifty above his head at the top of the town hall steps; instead of going down the stairs step by step, he jumped right up to his bride and fell in front of her on the pavement, his forehead split in two. It's all very well to say that we too have emotions that surpass others.
No less, Gaspard, little Denis and the young Toinon arrive arm in arm, singing and waddling with three good numbers on their caps!
It's our turn to laugh, we cried last year.
May the promised and the promised kiss each other. Let's go, let's go! Everyone on the way can talk about weddings.
Why not have them all on the same day, all three of them together?
That's right, three weddings! The whole of Saint-Brunelle would be there!
Ah, there goes another conscription! Understand: an assault, a calamity.
VIII
A RETURNING.
It's all about the wedding, my goodness! You'll see. Here is an adventure, here is one! I am going to tell you how it happened.
Have you heard of the Brugnon meadow, a meadow that you have to cross to enter our cemetery? Perhaps not.
I think that in order to give you an idea of where the Brugnon meadow is, I should tell you how our village is situated.
From the valley, Saint-Brunelle appears mid-slope; the houses, either in clusters or standing alone in the middle of their courtyards, seem to have been sown by an apprentice sower.
On this day, the green rye of the mountain rises straight up, as if to shade the fir trees of the castle.
As you can see, our church, our cemetery and thus the Brugnon meadow are at the bottom of the slope.
So, unlike some villages, you come straight to the main square. So much so that, when you come in from the fields or leave the houses to go there, you have to pass between the church and the cemetery, in the Brugnon meadow.
Ever since the world began, people have always heard sneezing in the ruins of the Brugnon convent. So, either out of fear of the stones that would be thrown at them if they forgot to say "À votre souhait!", or out of habit, or out of politeness towards the cold souls of the deceased monks, everyone, as they passed by, never forgot to repeat to every hatchic! they thought they heard: "À votre souhait! à votre souhait!
your wish! your wish!
Now, from All Saints' Day onwards, there had come to settle in the Brugnon meadow, around the hour of nightfall, a great, great returnee.
Every time you crossed the road, you had to put a penny on the wall of the cemetery, otherwise you'd be beaten with a stick.
Everyone complied by force, but not without sending the revenant to the devil.
Dizy the miser calculated that, at the end of the year, it would not fail to constitute an annuity of about forty francs, not counting the interest.
- The two of us will have to rack our brains to see what this revenant looks like under his shroud," said Jean-Claude.
- There's no rush, for a penny from time to time, to get yourself torn to shreds or thrown alive into the flames of hell," was the reply.
Some, moreover, claimed that ten strong men could not overcome a spirit.
Toinon, the Lambin woman and Perpétue's little girl added that one night, returning from Morlincourt, they had seen, as I see you, more than a hundred ghosts dancing on the walls of the cemetery, and that that time they had been obliged
to give a hundred sous between them.
- Bah! bah! the spirits of the earth will be happy to hold us to ransom if we don't push them around," said Father Roux, a shepherd who doesn't believe in ghosts any more than he believes in God and his saints.
When all was said and done, Jean-Claude consulted Father Roux to find a way out of this predicament. The idea of going head to head with a Huguenot could only have sprung from the minds of two Huguenots. Both of them hid their plan from the world, because, you see, they suspected someone alive, either from the country or the surrounding area, of playing such a trick on us.
So, on a clear night, as nine o'clock struck the church clock, Jean-Claude and Father Roux, the shepherd, crept behind the hedges as far as under the walls of our cemetery, talking as quietly as if nothing had happened, proposing just and simply in this case to play the club as best they could.
Suddenly, from the ruins of the old convent, the great revenant came out slowly, then step by step, counted and measured, looking to the right, to the left, in front and behind, he moved forward to take his usual place.
- Come quickly and fetch the change that's waiting for you!" said Father Roux, the shepherd, so quietly that the mind wouldn't have been able to hear him.
- Father Roux," said Jean-Claude, grabbing his stick, "you who have seen how things are done in the army during the war, show this
the usual courtesies to this enemy. Besides, as the oldest, you get the first shot!
The two Huguenots jumped down to the returnee, who was watching the practice quietly sitting on the side of the road.
Father Roux struck the spirit in the back with his club.
Judge! it began to scream like a natural person.
- Down with the shroud!" shouted Jean-Claude, grabbing the sheet with one hand and banging it with the other.
The ghost kept screaming.
- Shut up, you soul of contraband!" said Father Roux, the shepherd; "shut up, or I'll knock you out!
- Speak!" said Jean-Claude, "say your name, your real name, or I'll put you in the state of mind for good!
Will you stop?
Oh yes! the revenant ran at full speed, dragging the two woodcutters with him.
Then, just as they were pulling hardest, they collided and tumbled backwards, the sheet in their hands.
- Catch!" said Jean-Claude as he got to his feet; we had to be wary of this game.
- I'll run after it," said Father Roux, rubbing his knees.
At the same time, as they looked to see which way the ghost was running, they began to shout:
- Look, it's a white hat!
All the same, they were hardly mistaken, as we found out the next day.
- That's enough talking!" said Jean-Claude; "you mustn't take pleasure in
beating up women. We've got the sheet, it's marked; let's go to bed, there'll be time in the morning to find out who it belongs to. I'll find out sooner or later.
It was a beautiful moonlight, and even though it was the hour of the real ghosts, nothing was moving in the cemetery.
- That's enough to give the souls of dead monks all their head colds," said Father Roux, the shepherd, jokingly.
- Let's talk quickly and briefly," said Jean-Claude, who always went straight to the point. Today it's a question of taking advantage of this story to hunt down all the ghosts of Saint-Brunelle.
- Agreed, agreed!" said Father Roux; "it won't be difficult now.
As you can imagine, everyone said the next day:
- Well, since that ghost wasn't a real one, why shouldn't the others be?
You should have seen the thanks given to Jean-Claude, especially Dizy the miser, a man who walks around with his hands in his pockets while his money works for him. He shouted across the square, grabbing Jean-Claude's shoulders:
- My dear friend, you save me two sous every day; that's a good man, Jean-Claude; I wish you every happiness.
- Wish him never to fall into your clutches," said Clarisse Manot, who happened to be there: "Dizy the usurer! Dizy the miser!
Dizy the heartless!
You see, we can't stand people who lend money at interest.
I come back again to our story of the revenant. Believe it if you can, the white hat who had the idea of playing such a trick on us was the farmer's own maid next door to us! a girl from the woods who supposedly passed for honest!
Her account was quickly settled, don't worry.
But have you ever heard of a similar adventure?
I suppose it will have served some purpose. My guess is that nowadays people won't be so fearful when crossing the path of the Headless Men; that they won't talk so much rubbish when they come across a white rabbit by chance ; that some people will take the risk of jumping over the Poulains ditch at night, instead of making a diversion of three quarters of a league; and that, apart from the furolles that lead drunkards into the ditches, we will no longer believe in anything diabolical or supernatural. 
IX
THE NOCES.
At Norine's, at big Jacqueline's, at Perpétue's, everything is going on from top to bottom.
The village gossips shared the work under the orders of the three great cords [10] .
Under their orders, the pans were scoured, the vegetables peeled, the poultry plucked, the cakes and custards baked and unbaked, and then, in the early hours of the morning, the tables were laid in the houses.
As for the men, they went down to the cellars to break open the barrels of local cider and wine.
The housewives spent a fortnight storing their cream. I think we'll be able to use a lot of butter in our sauces.
Father Roux, the shepherd, says that the sun has risen in a cheerful mood; today he will give us a cheerful and honest face; we will return his compliments as comrades.
I get dressed with the door open, the better to watch the comers and goers. The guests from the surrounding area arrive from all sides: the men in their shirt sleeves, their suits at the end of a stick; the women carefully dressed in their Sunday best and with their breeches rolled up to the garter. Here's Madame Mayor in full regalia. I'm going to be late again! What a thing it is not to have a white bonnet for one's service; I'll have to get married; yes, but... Come on! I'll put on my tie and button up my waistcoat on the way. Let's line our pockets.
I'm going to Désirée and little Denis's wedding. Although I was invited elsewhere, I preferred to go to Norine's house.
As I entered, I saw Jean-Claude, who seemed to have an extraordinary air about him.
- Your friend! Jean-Claude," I said to him, "you look worried for a holiday.
Jean-Claude stood in front of me and said in an emotional voice:
- You have to agree with me that no one has ever seen, since the world began, a woman as beautiful and kind-hearted as she is.
- As beautiful as who?
- Our mayor, of course.
- That's true, my friend.
- She's here, in this room, with our bride, the schoolmaster, Rose and Norine; you wouldn't guess what she's doing there, she's such a wise woman for good things; what's more, she's dining with us, at the same dinner. Will we be proud? Ah!" he repeated as he saw our mayor leave his niece's room, "no, never, never, Cellier, have we seen a more kind-hearted woman.
While Jean-Claude was talking to me, I could also hear my head babbling. Apart from myself, I quickly remembered so many good things about our mayoress that, when I saw her appear followed by old Norine in tears and Rose on the arm of the schoolmaster, I couldn't help shouting, even if the rope had been at the end of my tongue:
- Long live our mayor!
Jean-Claude took my arm and then my neck, repeating:
- Long live our mayor!
And putting his mouth to my ear, he said:
- You've got a good heart!
She looked at us like that... for a long time, one at a time... as if we had been her little children, and she murmured to herself, with tears in her eyes:
- They love me and I'm worth so little!
Not so little already.
When the bride was ready and the hour had come, everyone took their places and set off for the town hall. The three brides met on the road and we saw quite a fine half of the procession, but I'll tell you more about them as they left the church.
So here we are at the town hall. If you want to get to know our mayor, you couldn't find a better opportunity.
Come on, he's a man who's indifferent to everyone, who doesn't worry about anything outside and worries about everything at home. Our mayor doesn't complain to anyone, but I think she's less happy than she should be.
From the town hall we enter the church.
At this time of day, the wedding masses are soon said; since the parish priest took the liberty of abolishing the old customs, we no longer recognise each other.
In the past, when the bride and groom were under the sheet, a boy chosen in advance would detach himself from the wedding party, approach the bride, and then, lifting her boot, he would untie a wide, long ribbon from her calf.
So, while the bride and groom and their families went to sign in the sacristy, the wedding boys came out of the church and bought a piece of the untied ribbon at auction.
Today, this ceremony takes place at the table. I'm sure that at Désirée's wedding they won't dare to do it, given the presence of the mayor.
It's not our parish priest's habit to preach at length at weddings, so much so that after an hour, everyone behind the bride and groom headed for the sacristy.
I must tell you the trick Jean-Claude played there.
He, Dizy the usurer, and then me, were all together, talking about one thing or another; all of a sudden Jean-Claude turned round and said, pointing to the opening of a poor box:
- I'll bet you a penny won't fit through there," he said and waved me over.
- I've got a bet," shouted Dizy, "how much?
- A dime.
- Go for ten.
And Dizy took out of his pocket a penny that looked freshly scrubbed. He took the coin between the thumb and first finger of his hand, then tried it out over the crack in the hole, and shouted:
- I've won!
- It's true!" said Jean-Claude, nudging his elbow.
The coin fell into the box and there was no way of getting it back.
Dizy yawned to see clearly. Jean-Claude drew a half-franc from his pocket and placed it in the miser's hand, saying:
- I've lost!
As you can imagine, everyone agreed with Jean-Claude and scoffed at Dizy.
But no less, we left the church and, with the violins in the lead, the three processions marched. It's only at this time of day that you can judge the state of the toilet. It's true! the women of today dress just as well as the ladies of yesteryear. The old white bonnets of our country claim it's a disgrace; I keep telling them that nice things don't cost any more now than ugly things used to.
Old people always imagine that nothing is or will be worth the pleasures of their youth. When we grow old, we will think the same. Instead of blaming, let's try to explain things. I'm sure that we'll all benefit and be consoled.
The wedding party I was following stopped first. The other two were allowed to pass on their way, not without the girls and gods on both sides having promised to meet again soon at the dance.
Here I am again, obliged to tell you about one of our customs.
You will know that in our countries, when the newly-weds return to the house where the wedding is taking place, the groom on one side and the bride on the other stand on the doorstep.
Their purpose is to acknowledge the new parents. The bride's father-in-law and the groom's mother-in-law introduce themselves first, followed by the parents, according to their degree of kinship. Compliments and kisses are exchanged, and then the guests enter the house as they go along.
I forgot to warn you that as you pass in front of the groom, you must put a coin of some sort in the hat he is holding in his hand.
I forgot to warn you that as you pass in front of the groom, you have to put a coin of some kind in the hat he is holding in his hand, supposedly to pay his fee. In fact, in our country we are forced to hire so many people that it would be enough to ruin the poor little kids who are getting married the day before.
Once everyone had been recognised, they ate a piece of pâté washed down with a glass of good cider, and soon, urged on by the young people, they headed for the dance hall, which happened to be Clarisse Manot's inn.
Given the circumstances, she had employed her man to
the walls. Clarisse has good taste; it's a real shame that Manot remains so stupid. I suppose, provided that in a cabaret the cabaretière is a bit wise, that's all that practice requires.
Now I'm too old to dance; so I say to
Jean-Claude:
- So I said to Jean-Claude: "While all these wigglers are struggling, why don't we get down to politics?
- Bah! bah!" he said, "I've had enough of your politics; I'm not getting involved any time soon; you lose your way; since the government doesn't want to tell its affairs to anyone, let it sort itself out.
For some time I'd been smelling a sort of odour in the dance hall that I couldn't quite define; I said to Jean-Claude:
- Do you smell like me?
- Yes," said Jean-Claude, "it's not allowed to stink up the world like that.
The smell was getting stronger and stronger, and when Baptiste, Jean-Claude's and then Norine's brother-in-law, came over to our side to say hello, I said to him:
- So you're the one who stinks like that?
- Yes," he said, "I've been sowing guano all these days, and it'll take me a fortnight to...
- I think," said Jean-Claude, cutting him off, "that it must be nice for our sister, supposing she sleeps with you.
- Even so!" said Baptiste, "my wife doesn't feel anything, she's deaf.
He's clever, Baptiste.
The girls started shouting: "The ring! The bride and groom's ring!
Who wants to see the experiment?
A table was brought and a glass filled with holy water. The three brides took off their engagement rings and we began. Everyone lined up behind the girls and behind the gods.
One after the other pulled out a hair, then put the ring inside, then hung it over the glass, asking three times:
- How long before I get married? I'm talking years.
The ring then struck one, two, ten or fifty times. When it didn't move, they asked it about the months, and it answered according to the people.
Jean-Claude said something like this:
- Above all, young men and women, never forget the ring's answers, and when the time marked by it has passed, don't fail to start again. Above all, I urge you to get it into your heads each time that you have failed the experiment, to try to believe that you are not as stupid as you seem.
- Shut up, Huguenot," said the fairies and the girls.
- Yes, shut up," said Father Roux, the shepherd, "or the ghost from Brugnon Meadow will come and beat you with a stick.
No one dared reply to that answer.
Where I come from, young people have such trouble discovering their destiny that they come up with all sorts of inventions to do it. À
proof of this is that on the first Friday of every month, those who want to know their wife or husband in advance put a mirror under their pillow. When they go to bed they recite five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys, an oration to Saint I don't know who, and they see the man or woman they are going to marry, just as I see you.
When it was time for dinner, the couple went their separate ways, promising to meet again in the evening.
At Norine's, they found the Mayoress. She was given the place of honour, as was her right, between the Rose and the schoolmaster. The dinner passed without too much nonsense being exchanged, as far as Madame la Mairesse was concerned, although, to do her full justice, she is not averse to words like some boorish women.
laughter. Halfway through dessert, Madame la Mairesse, thinking she was embarrassing us, got up from the table and, pointing to the Rose, said to all of us
all of us:
- I take this poor girl under my protection; whoever attacks her will attack me. Her child will bear the name of the man who indecently abused her, thanks to the good heart of the schoolmaster and his wife. La Rose has become a good seamstress; after the wedding she will stop going to the fields; those who provide her with work will oblige me.
- I'll give her my practice, I say; I'm a famous one, I don't have a white hat.
- Good, Cellier," said Madame la Mairesse, thanking me with her beautiful white hand, and then she continued: during the great summer labours, when fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters are forced to go out to the fields, the little children stay at home on their own; they need a mother to take care of them. I've found that mother: it's the Rose. While your little ones are rolling around her, the Rose will be working on her sewing. So the nannies won't have to spend a penny on looking after their babies. Come on, my good friends," said our mayor, taking Norine's daughter by the hand, "this poor girl needs your esteem; she's asking for it back. Won't she find joy in the services she can help me to render you?
you? Please forgive her.
I was beginning to choke and bray; it's a disease you get over quickly. Everyone did as I did, especially the white hats; the old men who had kept their hats came off, and we started shouting again: Long live our mayor! The schoolmaster kissed the Rose, the lad Denis kissed his new wife, Mother Denis, Norine, Jean-Claude and I all kissed each other. We all felt well-intentioned and didn't know what to say to show our contentment.
When everyone was a little more settled, we looked for the mayor: she had left.
Don't think that, because she saved the Rose from dishonour, Madame Mayoress doesn't value the virtue of girls. She does and proves it. More than once, when an honest young girl was short of a few écus to get married, Madame la Mairesse has given them out of her own pocket.
- It'll be what it will be," said Jean-Claude, climbing onto a chair, "next year she'll be the legitimate mayor of our commune!
- That's what I say, and we'll vote with both hands to make it more unanimous.

WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
Winter has passed.
Some of us have been making canvas in our cellars; others have been threshing in the barn and sowing mars.
All the same, it's wonderful to see the leaves come out in spring and the seeds sprout.
Right now, we're cutting hay. The white bonnets, rakes over their shoulders, come out into the sun to wither it. It's not tiring work; it's a dry year; we sleep peacefully, there's no hurry: the weather is not threatening.
Two days before La Rose gave birth, we learned of Pierre's death; he died gloriously on the battlefield.
La Rose gave birth to a little girl called Pierrette; the schoolmaster and his wife recognised her.
La Rose begins to go out; she seems calm and very attached to her little girl.
What a thing it is to be educated! She has become Norine's cheeky daughter, gentle and complaisant, kind and friendly to everyone. She won't be short of work.
The mayor has rented her a house where she can look after the little ones during the summer work season.
At least we won't have to hear any more about children being burnt
smothered by cats, or killed by falling out of their cots. And the poor people of Paris will have a few hours of fun every day. Mr Céran seems to be really pleased with this idea.
Jean-Claude has been bitten by a coal fly; without Madame la Mairesse's pharmacy, as our doctor said, Uncle de la Rose would easily have died.
Madame la mairesse, as a result, obtained a decree from our mayor ordering the village skinner to bury his animals, which he had hardly done until now. According to Mr Céran, it is from carrion that the flies that produce coal come out in the heat of the year.
In other, slightly more cheerful news, Father Roux, the shepherd, Jacqueline and Gaspard have been to see Paris, the big city. It cost the three of them eighteen francs in all, including the journey; they had taken a few sausages in their pockets, and their accommodation was with one of their cousins.
As soon as we heard that Father Roux, Gaspard and then Jacqueline had returned, as you can imagine, we went to ask them questions. But we were never able to get anything out of them. Gaspard and Jacqueline didn't want to say anything until the next evening, and Father Roux put us off until the following Sunday.
So, as we gathered at Clarisse Manot's, Father Roux began by saying:
- There are famously fewer of them than there are leaves on our trees; and it is my opinion that the most beautiful illuminations have never, despite many claims, been able to surpass in beauty a late morning, when the sun rises over the willows of the White Mountain.
- In this case, I say, it's not exactly rare.
- Damned fool!" said the old shepherd, "I maintain that a late morning is the rarest of things.
- Well," I teased, "what you see from day to day is not a rarity.
Don't start that chapter with Father Roux, you'll get him into a never-ending rage. Shepherds, you see, I've often heard it said that they motto with the stars and the sun; the proof is that they know the time just by looking at them.
- Have you seen the Vendôme column?" asked Manot. Is it very high?
- As high as about the poplars in our cemetery," said Père Roux; "perhaps it's taller than them; it might even be because it's grown on more dead people's bones!
- And is the cathedral of the people of Paris better decorated inside than our church? asked Clarisse; I've been told that you can see the sky through it.
- I'm sure," replied Father Roux, "that it's not the imitation stars I've been looking at on the floor that have given me such an idea; I think those stars, compared to ours, are a kind of mockery. Clarisse is decorated.
- Have you seen the Palais-Royal and the boulevards?" asked Jean-Claude.
- The boulevards are as busy as the streets of Morlincourt on the day of the draw, and even the people you meet there seem to me, like us that day, to be only curious or worried. Are you talking about the Palais-Royal? I've seen a lot of shops of all kinds there, especially watchmaking, and they're just a smidgen brighter than those in Morlincourt. I don't think it's a question of saying Paris for nothing. But there's one shop that really baffles me; I've never been able to find out what it was all about.
- A clever fellow like you," said Jean-Claude, "you've disgraced Saint-Brunelle? You should have asked.
- So I did," said the old shepherd, "because in truth, by
around that shop, I was beginning to get bewildered.
bewildered. It was a shop where you could only see piles of gold coins and silver paper. There was only one gentleman inside, and he looked quite honest to me through his windows. So I decided to go in.
- What do you want, my good man?" he asked me as soon as I opened the door.
- Excuse me, sir," I told him honestly, "I'm at a loss to know just what it is you're selling?
- I sell donkeys' heads, my good man," he replied in a tone of dishonesty to mock me.
Without making a fuss, I went back out into the street and said to the Parisian:
- My guess is, Monsieur, that you must have a cruel habit of selling donkey heads, because I can only see one left in your shop.
- Good!" shouted Jean-Claude, "you've answered nicely! You had to prove to the Parisians that you're not as stupid as you are badly dressed; and you proved it, Father Roux, my comrade!
XI
THE HARVEST.
The wheat is ripe, the ear, they say, will grain well.
Come out of your houses, merry reapers, come out of your houses to the fields.
The wheat is ripe.
Alert, reapers! Alert, white hats, alert! hang the golden links from your necks.
Alert! and make way for the gleaners.
They will come, led by the country warden. On their bare feet, on the stubble that they walk in line and at a walk.
The echo of the promises will repeat a thousand and one joyful refrains.
From the mountains and valleys, when the noon hour strikes, the harvesters will flock to the rendezvous.
Sitting on the sheaves, happily eating their lunch, they'll all be chatting.
The young men and the old men will bet together how much the dizeau should bring in this year.
In the evening, we'll go down the sunken path, aching with fatigue and hungry.
Oh, how soundly we sleep during the short nights when the work is long!
Come out of the houses, harvesters, come out of the houses to the fields.
The wheat is ripe.
Everything I said there is true, the bell ringing the harvest, the sparrows in the woods, the sparrows in the fields, the beasts in the stables, all singing the same thing.
In order not to go to France [11] , I undertook to
do the harvest for the farmer. I'll be paid in wheat: that's agreed; wheat is not money... But there is so much trouble in
France!
Ah! for those who leave the country, neither the sparrows, nor the animals, nor the village bell, sing the song of a moment ago...
earlier...
People from Morlinval, Morlincourt and the surrounding area, like the swallows of our thatches, gather on a fixed day. We make the journey in a troop. Each harvester carries a scythe, clogs, a few items of clothing, a loaf of black bread under his arm and a flask around his neck.
Before setting off, you look with tears in your eyes at the spire of the belfry, your heart beating like butter; but never mind! you have to leave.
Once outside the village, all is forgotten. At the end of the road, the beautiful gold coins gleam. Why miss the rusty church spire? We need money, you know, in our country; because, apart from the few pennies that the bonnets blancs earn from their yarns and poultry, we don't make much money. And then... it's all very nice to have a few écus.
Jean-Claude says that before the Revolution we didn't know how to buy the tiniest bit of property; that all we were left with was a few hard-earned écus. I think those times
were famously hard. It's so good to cut your own wood and sow your own seed. We had to pamper our precious écus!
According to the stories, that time is not far from now, and it's hardly surprising that the peasant still has a kind of weakness for gold and silver. Rest assured that this love alone will drive us to the harvests of France.
The farmers around here pay only in wheat. You will tell me that wheat can be sold; well you think so! but it will never be the same thing... The harvester prefers the yellow ear of wheat, which is long and grey, to the yellow ear of wheat, which is cashy and ringing. It's a simple matter of ringing the bell, because, like wheat, money is easy to shell.
But it's a tough job going to France: you have to do it on foot
walking at night, lying down during the day anywhere, in the open fields, on the roads, when the sun is too hot.
Sometimes, the old men or the little boys, or the white bonnets, stay on the road; they are supposed to return to the village, entrusted to the charity of passers-by. But alas! help is often lacking... The poor arrears never return.
The gang can't stop, time is running out: keep your feet up!
We're waiting for them.
What a sad state of affairs to arrive in? You've come to work and... you're working. Everyone picks and chooses. Better done than done! Do we have time to be sick?
But, you judge, the change of country, of habits, of soup when you eat, of drink, isn't there enough to destroy the best health? You can only cure yourself by running, and you return half dead... Money! Bloody money!
Here's a hot one, we're so tired! We've been hard at work harvesting. The weather's so dry that the wheat's falling apart... If all the reapers had been there, we'd have had only half a chance, but the best ones have gone to France.
Will they come back alive? And in what condition? Let's hope they don't bring back another epidemic! If only! Mr Céran will cure us.
Father Roux, the shepherd, maintains that the moon has a grain or two, and the rains will come. I saw two pieces of wheat still standing in the fields: one belongs to Jean-Claude and the other to Cadet Lambin, both of whom belong to France. If it rains, their poor wheat will sprout.
Every year, we celebrate the return of the franciers [12] , and it's almost always a funeral...
There they are! There they are! Here they come again!
- Where are they now? - In the square! - Let's run to embrace them!
- They've been gone for fifteen long days and fifteen long nights! - My poor son! - My poor man!
shout the white hats. - Let's run, let's run to embrace them.
- What a sight! Are they yellow! Are they!
- Don't come any closer," said Jean-Claude, "we're bringing back the epidemic.
That word saved everyone, even the women and mothers.
The desolation of desolation, the epidemic is in Saint-Brunelle!
- Some kind soul should go and fetch the doctor," said Jean-Claude again in a dying voice.
XII
THE EPIDEMIC.
- That good soul will be me, Cellier," I replied to
Jean-Claude replied.
Arriving at Morlincourt, in front of Mr. Céran's door, I stopped to think to myself how I should go about doing my errand.
Mr Céran is going to get angry again; as usual, every year at this time of year, he throws the book at the franciers.
We'll have to make up our minds.
Mrs Céran is here, so much the better! She'll defend us; she's a good woman, not at all proud, and she likes to chat with people about their business while they're waiting for her man.
- Monsieur Céran," I said to our doctor, who was having dinner, "would you like to come straight away to Saint-Brunelle, as the Franciers have arrived with their fevers?
I didn't dare mention the epidemic. We have to wait until the storm has passed. Monsieur Céran, what's the point of getting yourself into such a state? Oh, yes!
- It's like banging your head against the wall," says our doctor.
They've gone a long way with their money... Here, for two sous we could... (I don't dare repeat what he said) to a peasant!
- It's true, I say after him, so as not to offend him.
- If it's true!" he starts again, "I do believe it's true! Come on, I'm going to get ready. Run to the apothecary and ask for some seltzer. I'll pick you up on the way.
As the apothecary finished twisting my bottles, M. Céran stopped, and I hurried up without saying a word to get in his cabriolet beside him.
in his cabriolet.
Our doctor's pet took off at a fast trot. Tell me about that beast, friendly to everyone, quiet at the gates, and lively on the run.
We're going down to Jean-Claude's. Madame la mairesse and La Rose are already there. Thérèse is incapable of anything, all she can do is bray and berate the epidemic.
You saw Mr Céran very angry, didn't you? Well, you wouldn't say he was the same man.
He spoke to Jean-Claude, Thérèse, the mayor, La Rose and myself in a soothing voice, and he calmly explained to us what had to be done: not a word of reproach! But as for that, between us, I don't think we'll lose anything by waiting.
- Stay close to your uncle, La Rose," said Mr Céran; "did you understand what I recommended? If there's anything missing, send for the mayor; I'll be back tomorrow.
And Mr Céran leaves with our mayor.
As I had to take the bottles to the town hall, I followed them for a while and listened to what they were saying, without doing so on purpose.
- We'll have to find a way out of this mess once and for all," says our doctor.
- My good friend," says Madame la Mairesse, "I've found that way; let's deal with the present, get well, get well!
This is no longer the Saint-Brunelle of weddings; rich, poor, all the houses are upside down; there is no taste for anything, the animals remain in the stables, the people at the corners of their fireplaces without fire; if we meet, it is to ask each other in a shuffling voice how this one or that one is doing.
Madame la mairesse and la Rose acted as nursemaids to
to one and all. Come on, come on! Anyone who dares to attack Jean-Claude's niece today would be very ill-advised.
The masters of the château have left on a trip to Paris, for fear of catching the disease.
In the surrounding area, the epidemic has spread from strength to strength.
Mr Céran, who has no helpers in these parts like our mayor and La Rose, is losing a quarter of his patients despite all his care.
In the past, even in Saint-Brunelle, people turned away from those who had the epidemic; no one wanted to go near them, and they often died in a corner, without help, like dogs; but since we have seen the mayor look after them, without seeming to take any notice, we have no longer dared to do anything different from her, and no one has been unwell.
What's more, I'm sure that now the epidemic won't destroy
because those who fell ill from fear did not fall ill with us this year.
At the end of the day, however, everyone is back on their feet. Unfortunately!
there won't be much money left in the cupboard. I reckon that when the apothecary, the butcher and the doctor are paid, the bursar's shop will start ringing. Even so!
there's nothing to complain about. Out of thirty-eight patients, only Father Roux, a shepherd, died at Saint-Brunelle. He died denying God. As his last hour approached, he summoned his friends and relatives and told them: "I have lived honestly, I will die honestly; there is no need for bells at my funeral; rest assured, I will never return; if I leave my grave, it will not be, my comrades, to visit you, I know you, but to see again the stars in the sky above us". And he died uttering words of witchcraft: Venus, Berenice, Cassiopeia!
The schoolmaster has been very ill. La Rose has been watching over him for ten nights, pampering him like a father. Today, from the bottom of his heart, he calls her:
"my daughter!
Wasn't all this thanks to the Mayor? Without her, the Rose would have suffered some misfortune, you can be sure of that.
Madame Mayor, repeat it, she is one of the first women in the whole world!
We've had a sad party this year; what a difference from those of the past! It seems that families no longer take the same pleasure in spawning together. Explain that.
As best we can, we're getting back to work. And now it's time to pick hemp. The females are already ripe.
In the morning, hemp growers and hemp growers set off, all numb, but you soon get to enjoy yourself in the fields. You see, the smell of hemp goes to the hemp growers' heads and makes them sing, like the goat later on.
to sing, just as the hemp seed makes the sparrows
whistle.
Once the females have been picked, the males are harvested [13].
In our countries, since hemp is not grown on a large scale, we are in a hurry to enjoy our harvest, so we put it into the retting machines as soon as it is dry, and then take it out in the middle of winter.
When we find our hemp sufficiently drained, we chew it [14]; later the white bonnets spin it. It is with this thread that we weavers make cloth.
XIII
A PETITION.
Every year, around the month of October, we start the wakes all over again.
So at the first, while we were talking, as usual, about things and
Rose suddenly entered, holding a large piece of paper in her hand.
- Good evening to you all," she said; "I've come on behalf of the mayor.
- Welcome," said Jean-Claude. What's in it for her? Speak quickly; whatever she asks of us, we'll always be our mayor's servants.
- I've brought you a petition that all the Franciers must sign; read it carefully, Uncle," said La Rose, handing her paper to Jean-Claude.
This is what the petition said; I have rewritten it so as not to omit a single word:
"To the Directors of the Northern Railways.
"Gentlemen,
"Since the invention of pleasure trains, every Parisian knows the beauties of the provinces, every provincial has seen Paris. Nothing could be better. Travel is good for intellectual development.
"But how much more useful would be trains that could easily be organised!
"At harvest time, the reapers from the north, from Belgium and Picardy, go down to the centre of France; the poor people travel on foot, some fifty to eighty leagues, others one hundred to two hundred.
"The result is extreme fatigue and a considerable loss of time at a time when workers are in short supply everywhere.
"Freighters come back sick, develop epidemics and pose a real danger to public health.
"It would be a question of transporting the harvesters who come down from the North at harvest time to given points, at prices equivalent to those of pleasure trains, and even lower if possible.
"Since you, gentlemen, have been able to find a way to win on pleasure trains, it would be sad to think that you would have to lose. WORK TRAINS.
"Yours sincerely [15] ...".
- The usual courtesies!" said Jean-Claude. What do you think of this petition?
- All the same," said one of them, "if we could manage not to pay more to go to France than Father Roux, the shepherd, did on his trip to Paris, that would be a great advantage.
- Don't you dare say that the bonnets blancs don't understand anything about administration," said Jean-Claude; "I'll tell you that never in his life, never in his days, would one of us fools have thought of such a petition. How useful it would be, for the poor people of our countries, to settle such a matter! I think that in order to complete, in a single night, the journey that takes us eight or ten days to finish, we would willingly take a diversion of a few leagues to find railway stations.
- Madame la mairesse," says La Rose, "also recommended that I let you know that it would be profitable to spread this petition quickly throughout the surrounding villages. If we can succeed in producing an effect of great unanimity, as our mayoress says, then the project will be taken in a different way and given more consideration.
- I'll take care of everything," says Jean-Claude. Besides, everyone has a private interest in the matter. Go on, my Rose, we won't be blamed for negligence or delay if she doesn't get her legitimate rights and a successful outcome.
- It's all the same," said Father Remblay, "we have to agree that if we are reluctant to do the chores that our mayor orders us to do according to the law, we wouldn't look the same if our mayor were to order us to do them.
What's more, I'm sure she'd know how to do it in such a way that we'd think we were working as much for ourselves as for others. Come on! come on! in my little judgement, it seems to me that when the mayors of the communes and then the governments of the countries make use of the secrets of our mayoress, they will know how to give courage and strength to everyone.
- Ta! ta! ta! Father Remblay," said Jean-Claude, "the clearest thing of all is that a mayor like ours wouldn't cause much harm in every commune.
- Ah, I think so," said the white bonnets, the young men and the old men, "there's no doubt about that at Saint-Brunelle!
