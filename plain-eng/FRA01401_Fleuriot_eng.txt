I -- The tutor
"I want to grow a beard!
So spoke a man of ten years of age, little Léopold Massereau. Rummaging around in a drawer, he had found a pair of razors that were worn to a crisp. Suddenly seized by the desire to pose like a big boy, he perched on a stool in front of the oval mirror of a mahogany toilet, brandished the razor and repeated in a commanding voice:
"I want to have a beard!
- What? what? my God! what do I hear?" cried a woman's breathless voice.
And the door opened in front of a lady of about sixty, dressed with the methodical care typical of the province.
Between two small yellowish headbands applied to her temples and descending in festoons to her cheeks, glittered two yellowish eyes also, with an anxious, mobile gaze, and all filled with that particular expression which makes people say that they are inconvenient.
"Godmother, I want to have a beard.
- A beard? Where did you get that razor, you naughty child, you terrible child?
Little Leopold may have been terrible in spirit, but how puny he was physically, skinny, pale and yet very well built!
"There," he said, pointing to the last drawer of an old chest of drawers which, opposite the mahogany toilet, looked just like an old marquis in a gaudy coat and tricorne, looking down from his height at a modern little gentleman in a black frac and stovepipe.
"But we never open this drawer, Leopold, never; it's been more than two years since I opened it. It contains nothing but old things.
As she spoke, she looked worriedly at the child's hand clutching the handle of the razor, and her finger was feverishly touching a small shiny object in the middle of his forehead, which was none other than an ironwork.
Yes, Mme Caroline Massereau had been so faithful as to keep, in spite of all fashion, this little gold plate threaded through a silk cord. Only it no longer adorned her forehead, but was placed just between the two small flat bands which unfortunately narrowed her already singularly narrow temples.
Léo," she continued, "give me that razor, my child.
- But I'm telling you I want to have a beard! Lather up some soap.
- You can have soap if you give me the razor.
- Will you give it back to me?
- Yes, yes; give it, my little darling, give it, my Leo.
While uttering these tender words, Mme Massereau approached the little boy and half willingly, half forcibly, snatched the dangerous instrument from him.
She considered it, turned it over in all directions, and finally passed the blade over his finger.
Give it to me," cried Leopold impatiently.
- Here," she smiled.
She had made sure that the old razor had no wires and that the blade would not cut any deeper than a wooden blade.
Lather me up with soap," said Leopold in his imperious, dishonest tone.
- Wait, I'll ask Marie-Céline for some.
Mme Massereau left the room and walked onto a strange landing that stood like a narrow bridge between the two parts of the old house. Leaning on the thick balustrade that served as a parapet, she called out:
"Marie-Céline!
In the little recess formed by the stairwell on the ground floor, a white cap appeared; a ruddy face, very honest, rose towards the bridge, and a voice as rough as Mme Massereau's was acute said:
"What is it, madame?
This was generally how mistress and servant corresponded.
Most of the time it was just a simple call, but sometimes real conversations took place between the two women, and the noise of their voices animated the silent old house for a moment.
Marie-Céline," cried the mistress, "he wants to grow a beard.
A burst of laughter shook the walls.
"What a game, Madame! Don't let him do it, he'll cut his face.
- The razor doesn't cut, and since he absolutely wants it, make some soap water and bring it straight away.
With this order given, Mme Massereau joined Léopold, who was still perched on his stool and busy twirling the old razor across his beardless cheeks.
What do you smear soap on your face with?" he asked suddenly.
- With a brush; there must be one at the back of the drawer.
And Mme Massereau went and knelt down in front of the old drawer, the contents of which smelt very musty.
As she pulled out a beard brush, Marie-Céline appeared with a small bowl in her hand. The brush was carefully washed, and Léopold, dipping it into the bowl full of soap water, began to lather it on his cheeks.
His aunt and maid, standing on either side of the mirror, gazed at him delightedly; and when he began to gently scrape his right cheek with the old razor, they rushed over to kiss him.
But he waved them away and shouted roguishly:
"Leave me alone!
He had scarcely uttered this coarse word before he was speechless. Standing in the open doorway was a tall man with a formidable black moustache mingled with grey.
Seeing himself uncovered, the visitor put his hat in his hand and advanced to meet Mme Massereau, who was walking unhurriedly to meet him.
My cousin, you can boast that you gave me a great fright," she said, holding out her hand.
- Unintentionally, of course, Caroline. Judge for yourself: I arrive, find the front door open, call out, no one answers, go up the stairs, call out again; this time I get two bursts of laughter; I push open the door and see my ward with a beard. Is that boy still original? Come on, Marie-Céline, wash him off quickly and let him come and kiss me.
Léopold jumped down from his stool and plunged his face into a basin. Marie-Céline, armed with a towel, removed all the foam and he came over to kiss the visitor, who looked at him very attentively for a while.
"My son Gustave, who is your age, is a head taller than you.
- Oh, my dear colonel, he's really grown up," exclaimed Mme Massereau. I, who knits him stockings, and Marie-Céline, who puts extensions on his blouses, know all about it.
- That's an argument without reply, my dear cousin. Have I offered you all the memories, all the friendships, all the respect of my family?
- I haven't even had time to ask you for news. Your arrival was so unexpected!
- And the sight of Leopold trimming his beard distracted me so much myself! Go and play, my child, don't worry about me any more. We'll meet again.
He gave Leopold a friendly pat on the shoulder and, crossing his boots one on top of the other, continued:
"Thank goodness everyone is well. My mother is as you have always seen her, a little less ingamous perhaps; my wife is still in perfect health, and the children, my goodness, are sprouting like mushrooms. Edouard, who is not yet fourteen, is coming up to my shoulder.
- Already! And Amélie?
- Amélie is still her grandmother's pride and joy.
- And Gustave and Alfred?
- Gustave and Fédik are growing up too. Fédik talks like a little magpie, but insists on not pronouncing the *r*, so my good Alsatian servant is no longer called Choucroute, but Choucoute. Gustave is just about Léopold's age, I think.
- He's eight months older.
- That won't stop them from being contemporaries. Well, Léopold, you've come back to us; why don't you come over here and let me do a little inspection?
Léopold, who had slipped his head through the doorway in the hope of not being seen, ran towards his uncle. His uncle grabbed him by the waist and sat him on his knees.
You don't weigh more than my little Fédik," he laughed. He's a big boy who, if I'm not mistaken, will wear a military harness like his father.
- Will Alfred be an officer, Uncle?" exclaimed Leopold.
- I don't know, but he's already commanding his lead regiment in the most brilliant fashion. Only he always says: "Potez... ames! -- What are you looking at?
- What you have in your buttonhole; it's not your little ribbon like it used to be.
- In fact, it's been transformed into an Officer's Rosette of the Legion of Honour, a little ribbon that's pretty hard to win, believe me. Let's see, do you fancy it? Do you want to be a soldier like Gustave and Alfred?
- Me? No. I play at being a soldier, I have two squadrons and a fully armed bastion; but I'm afraid of real guns when they go off.
- For example, if you're chicken, I'll disown you for my nephew!" exclaimed Colonel Dauvellec, pretending to put the child down.
- My dear cousin, believe me, he's very bold, far too bold even," cried Madame Caroline; "there's not a day that goes by when I don't find him straddling the landing railings.
- That's simple gymnastics, my cousin; the most timid boy likes to ride on wooden horses. Do you know, Leopold, that if you become a capon, you will lose your reputation with your cousins?
- I'm not a capon," exclaimed Leopold, who blushed from ear to ear.
- So much the better! But let's get back to business. What will you be? A sailor?
- Oh no, sailors are shipwrecked.
- A civilian? You'll be a civilian's seed. Magistrate?
- No, you won't!
- Will you be a tax collector like your godfather?
- No, my godfather says it's boring.
- What? What? You'll be something, won't you?
Léopold looked down at his uncle as if to check the effect of his statement and said:
"I want to be a pastry cook.
The colonel burst out laughing and, putting the child down on the floor, said:
"That's it, to eat the shop!
- Oh yes, he'll make buns out of them," said a big hoarse voice behind the door, "and above all he'll eat them, my dear colonel!
And a fat man with a jovial, illuminated face entered the flat.
He shook hands cordially with his visitor, threw himself breathlessly into an armchair and held out his hat and cane.
Madame Caroline understood this gesture and hastened to clear away his hat and cane.
Then the conversation resumed with all that had been said above; family news was brought up again. Mr Dauvellec spoke again complacently about his mother, his wife, his daughter, his boys, especially his daughter, whose name alone brought a very sweet smile to his male face, and his little Fédik, who talked about everything, about everything, but couldn't bring himself to pronounce the *r*s.
Are you staying with us for a few days, Colonel?" asked Mr Massereau, loosening his tie to give himself a bit of air.
- I'm just passing through. Called to Rennes on a family matter, I thought it wise to branch off here in order to find out a little about my ward and at the same time settle the small matter of the estate which is in the hands of the notary in your town, Mr Moison.
- A short while ago he asked me for your current address.
- Was he at his office?
- He's there from nine o'clock to noon, regularly.
The colonel rose.
If you don't mind, Caroline," he said to Mme Massereau, "I'm going to deal with this first case straight away, before dinner, which will allow me to devote the whole afternoon to you.
- Come on," said Mr Massereau, making a huge effort to stand up.
And he added, shaking himself:
"Caroline, quickly!
Mme Massereau quickly went round the flat and presented herself with the hat and cane.
"My gloves.
- What gloves?
- The black ones... no, the grey ones... no... the hazel ones."
Mme Massereau rushed to a drawer and returned with a pair of gloves carefully wrapped in tissue paper.
Her husband took the parcel with a mysterious sign, and as he unfolded it he murmured:
"Good breakfast, my wife, oysters... sauterne... from the one on the corner, on the left. Perhaps I'll bring the notary along.
And suddenly raising his head, he let out a tremendous hum and followed Mr Dauvellec.
Mme Massereau was left alone, with the tissue paper between her fingers, mumbling between her teeth, folding and unfolding it, pulling it in all directions. Suddenly she would unfold the light cloth, and her gaze would stare at it as if she saw unknown and frightening characters appearing; then she would fold it and fold it again briskly to unfold it again. Finally, folding it into quarters, she threw it into the drawer from which it had come, and, reaching the strange landing, she called out:
"Marie-Céline!
- What is it, madame?" came the reply in the rough voice of the peasant woman.
- Where's Léopold?
- He's here, my goodness! putting me to sleep. Doesn't he want to cook potatoes in the ashes of my stove!
- If there's no danger of him burning his fingers or starting a fire, let him do it and come up and talk to me about the household.
- But, madam, if he eats all morning, he won't be able to have dinner.
- Yes, yes!" cried the little boy's piercing voice, "I'll have dinner all the same; go away, go away, because my godmother is calling you.
Marie-Céline, grumbling between her teeth, stirred her pots and pans, then decided to climb the few steps that would put her in a position to converse with her mistress.
Well, it's lunch, no doubt," she said, fastening a corner of her white tea towel to her belt, "I have to say that the colonel is having a very bad day.
Mme Massereau made a mysterious sign of appeal to her, and hurried back into the room.
"What's new, Madame?" asked the maid, rushing after her.
Mme Massereau turned to her all at once and, crossing her arms, said:
"What's the colonel doing here?
- You know better than me, no doubt. Does his wife have any good news for us?
- He has his businessman, not to mention my husband who has always looked after his interests. That's not why, no, no, Marie-Céline: he's coming for Leopold.
- For Leopold?
- You know as well as I do that he's his guardian.
- And the boy is ten years old. How time flies!
- I can't bear it if he takes him away from us.
- Take him away! Could he take him away from us?
- Why not, since he's his guardian? Ah, if M. Massereau had wanted to play hard to get, he would have been appointed guardian, and I wouldn't always be on the spot, fearing that a child I've brought up, who is my niece's son, who will be my heir, might be taken away from me.
- It's true that he's all that, ma'am.
- I could never get used to doing without him.
- Nor could I. He's mischievous and boisterous, but a good boy. Keep him, madam, keep him. What would the Colonel do with him? Doesn't he have lots of children?
- And we only have Léopold!
"He'd put him in school. When he writes to me, all he ever talks about is the school.
- But a collège is a school; there's no shortage of schools in the city, Madame.
- Not like the one he needs. But he's very young, and if Mr Massereau had done a good job, we'd have every right to keep him. He's the one who's pushing the Dauvellecs to look after Léopold; he's constantly writing to them, saying that I'm spoiling him, that he's unpleasant, all in a joking tone; but by dint of joking you get what you want.
Marie-Céline put on a very smart face:
"Is Monsieur not a bit jealous, madame? Lately he's always after the child, especially at the table. Mr Leopold should no longer be given the best morsels, that's what annoys Monsieur.
- Leopold asks for what he likes, there's nothing wrong with that, and I'm quite happy to go without for him. But these men are so selfish, my poor girl! Everything for them, that's their motto.
Marie-Céline gravely bowed her head in assent.
"If Leopold left, I'd die of boredom with Mr Massereau, who's turning into a real groundhog.
- It's good for him to sleep, Madame; big men like him always have one eye half shut, as far as I've noticed. To tell the truth, I think he eats a bit too much and likes the good stuff too much. That's no good for your health, as the old-timers say.
- My husband is certainly a good fork, and I don't think he could find a better kitchen anywhere. Oh, I'll pass on that habit to him: he can leave Leopold to me. If he talks to you about it, Marie-Céline, tell him that we are not prepared to let him do it. Don't go along with him as you sometimes do. He wants to let go, and there aren't too many of us to hold him back. I also recommend that you say nothing about the child's mischief while the colonel is here.
- However, madam, if he gets into mischief as he usually does?
- We'll punish him afterwards; but for the moment, let's keep quiet. The Dauvellec family don't know anything about children, they have their own way of bringing up their own, who are nice, I'm not saying no, but whose manners I don't like. Léopold would be very unhappy with these people.
- So they can take him for good? I thought it was to frighten Leopold that Monsieur always says to him when he's being naughty:
"Wait, wait, Mr I-want-to-be, when your guardian takes you back, you'll be in for a treat!
- If he didn't have any rights over him, I wouldn't bother with his visit. However, we'll see. There's nothing urgent for you to do in the kitchen now. Go and take Léopold to school.
- It's past the hour, Madame.
- Never mind! I said last week that he was ill, but today he has to go, whether he likes it or not.
As she said this, Mme Massereau rose and went downstairs, followed by Marie-Céline, who laughed and said:
"He's going to whine, you'll have to see!
When she crossed the threshold into the kitchen, her smile faded and she leapt towards the lit stove:
Good God!" she said, "what an imagination he's got! You see, madam, all my butter has melted and he's up to his nose in it.
Léopold, sitting with his legs dangling over one of the corners of the stove, his nose and chin glistening with grease, was carefully digging out a steaming potato and, unfazed by Marie-Céline's furious exclamation, slipped some butter borrowed from a plate next to him into the hole. But he hadn't noticed that the heat from the lit stove was reaching the end of the dish, and that on one side the lump of butter was dripping oil.
It only took a minute for the vigorous cook to take the dish in one hand and the little gourmand in the other.
That's the last one," laughed the little boy as he licked his potato, "I don't care if you squeeze the butter!
Mme Massereau stepped forward quickly between them, and, looking at Marie-Céline with an air of intelligence, waving her hand eloquently, she said:
"Come, he won't do it again, he won't do it again."
And, turning sharply away, she led Léopold away, who was making triumphant faces at Marie-Céline and sticking his tongue out at her. They arrived, one dragging the other, in the upstairs bedroom, which was obviously the child's room. There, Mme Massereau gave him a quick examination and finally took out a wet sponge.
Come and let me wash you," she ordered.
- Why? I don't want to wash myself.
- You've got butter on your nose, on your cheeks, everywhere.
Léopold stood in front of a mirror and, faced with what he saw, no longer resisted; but during the operation he remained in front of the mirror, squinting, sticking out his tongue and making himself as ugly as possible.
Now," said Madame Massereau in her sweetest voice, "just comb out your hair and you'll be all nice and ready to go to school.
- School?" cried the child, "I don't want to go to school.
- Come on, Léo, don't get angry, your leave's over, you're not ill any more.
- I want to be sick!
- Don't be so mean. Where are your books?
- I don't know where they are.
- Look for them while I put on my hat, I'll drive you myself.
- I don't mind!
- Come on, be a good boy, Leo, look for your notebooks and books. I'll be ready in five minutes.
Mme Massereau went out, and Léopold looked for a box of lead soldiers which he began to line up peacefully.
Léopold, have you got your books and exercise books?" suddenly asked Mme Massereau through the partition.
- I haven't found them," replied Léopold, who was placing a cannon on its end.
- Look in the study, your leather bag must be hanging on the peg.
Leopold did not reply.
I'm coming, are you ready?" shouted Mme Massereau again.
- Good! that naughty horse has skinned my finger with his tail," said the little boy; "for his trouble I'm going to break his leg.
And he twisted the horse's leaden leg just as his aunt entered the room.
Well," she cried, "what are you doing here?
- I'm playing, I want to play soldiers.
This was too much for Mme Massereau, who had no patience and was spurred on by fear.
She pounced on the disobedient child, shaking him vigorously by both arms and shouting:
"Do you want the colonel to take you away?
- Where?" said Léopold phlegmatically, who felt neither fear nor pain.
- But to his home, to his family, where they'll make you miserable! Will you get up? Will you take your cap? Here's your bag.
She wrapped a patent leather strap round the child's neck.
He immediately pulled it over his head, threw his bag on the ground and said coldly:
"I want to stay and play soldiers.
Mme Massereau, who had her own reasons for dreading Léopold's disobedience that day, grabbed him again by both arms.
Naughty child!" she cried, "you want him to take you away! He'll take you away!
The child let himself be shaken and, still neither afraid nor hurt, watched his aunt's decomposed face.
"Will he really take me if I don't go to school?
- Yes, yes, and he'll do the right thing.
- I don't want to," said Leopold. My bag!"
Mme Massereau rushed to the bag and tightened the leather strap around the child's neck.
You'll give me ten sous, godmother," said Léopold, trying to make the most of his concession.
- Yes, yes, here they are.
- And Marie-Céline will drive me," added Léopold, pocketing the ten sous.
- And why is that?
- Just because.
- By the way, she must have told our day wives; the school's not that far away. Go and see if she wants to go, because she's not very easy to get to every day either.
Léopold dashed down to the kitchen, where Marie-Céline was ranting to two busy women.
Marie-Céline, come and take me to school," he said.
- Oh yes, it is school, Monsieur Léopold; I'm going to bread my chops.
- Come on, I tell you," he continued, pulling her by the corner of her apron; "we'll go by your aunt's waffle house and I'll buy some for three sous.
These words triumphed over Marie-Céline's resistance. She untied her canvas apron and followed Léopold, but stopped at the bottom of the stairs:
Madam, have the chops breaded," she said; "you know very well that Monsieur is very fussy about that.
- Go on, off you go," replied Madame Massereau, who was trembling with impatience on the balustrade of her landing as she watched this departure, too slow for her liking; "I'll take care of everything.
It wasn't the care of her home that embarrassed her; she had at her fingertips the precious science of housework, she knew how to lay a table in the right order, arrange the symmetry of the dessert, if necessary cook a chop to perfection and prepare a fricassee of chicken. Her farmyard was renowned; she had acclimatised the pheasant in Brittany and fattened up the geese. But there was another side to raising a small turkey or a child, and Mme Massereau had not the slightest idea of this higher science. She never went beyond material care, and gave it much more clumsily to her godson than to her little animals. Her chickens and her canaries, not having received the sublime gift of freedom, and never following anything but their blind and sure instinct, did not give themselves indigestion, did not remain huddled under a quilt at the healthy hour of the morning walk, did not constantly vary their food on a whim, and never got angry, which is extremely unhealthy. They were never bored, which is no less unhealthy, and which was always the case with Leopold, whose strange, strong-willed character condemned him to absolute solitude.
II -- The burning question
When Colonel Dauvellec and Mr. Massereau returned, they were ushered by Mrs. Massereau into the dining room where the table was laid.
The sight of the table glittering with silverware made Mr Massereau smile.
Don't keep us waiting for dinner, Caroline," he said, consulting his large gold watch. Noon is about to strike and I've put my watch on the Town Hall dial.
Mme Massereau replied majestically:
"You'll have to wait, Fortuné, until your nephew is back from school.
- He went to school today!
- He wasn't indisposed today," replied Mme Massereau curtly. Why do you think he missed school?
Mr Massereau was about to retort, but just then a serving woman entered carrying a sweet hors d'oeuvre that was crowned with a small cloud of fragrant steam. He smiled, sucked in the puff that hit him as it passed, and, winking tenderly, said:
Caroline," he said prophetically, "this is a rice soufflé you've put your hand into.
- No doubt: don't I know how picky you are about soufflés?
- And how much I love them! A well-made soufflé, Colonel, is the best of all desserts. Isn't that your opinion?
- At least that's my wife's opinion, I think," replied the colonel, smiling, "because I often see them appear on my table.
- Oh, you have a precious wife too, my dear. Even when people were talking enthusiastically about her talent on the piano, I, who am not an artist, admired her good housekeeping and her way of entertaining.
- She does indeed have the supreme talent of not ignoring or neglecting any of her duties," replied M. Dauvellec seriously.
- Caroline, shall we sit down to dinner?" asked M. Massereau.
- If you like," replied Mme Massereau; "I'm waiting for Léopold.
She moved towards the door, which opened in front of the little boy. Proud to see him appear like a schoolboy, his leather bag slung over his shoulder, his face and hands blotched with ink, she led him to the colonel, then took him away, saying:
"Gentlemen, dinner is about to be served, and I only need a minute of your time to rid Leopold of all this paraphernalia.
Having said that, she took him to the first floor bedroom, proceeded to clean him up and then took both his hands:
Leopold," she said quickly, "you're going to be good at the table.
- Yes," he replied, whimpering, "I'm bored at school.
- You won't ask anything, you won't feel anything, you won't say anything.
- Oh well, godmother, that'll be fun! And what will you give me for it?
- Three days' leave when your uncle leaves.
- And after that?
- A box of chocolate pastilles.
- And then what?
- That's not enough!
- No, you've got to promise to buy me the little trolley from the toy shop.
- I'll buy it.
- And I'll go and have dinner in the kitchen, if I'm hungry, and eat everything?
- Yes, you can.
- Tell Marie-Céline that.
- Of course I will. Come along."
She took him into the dining room and dinner began. Léopold, stiff as a board, kept his word and didn't say a word of nonsense to his aunt. His aunt did not lose sight of him and at the slightest indiscreet gesture, she gave him a glance full of intelligence, all the better understood as the colonel intimidated the child, who only wanted one thing: for this boring meal to end.
When the coffee appeared on the table, Léopold got up and left like an arrow.
Léopold has been such a good boy today," said Mr Massereau, helping himself to some sugar.
- Too wise," remarked the colonel, "he hardly ate at all.
- But he never forgets," continued Mr Massereau, laughing. Your rosette and your moustaches have petrified the kid! We'll see how uptight he is this evening.
- He generally behaves well in society," remarked Mme Massereau with a truly comical seriousness.
- Not in ours, not in ours, Caroline.
- Ours," repeated Mme Massereau irritably, "ours is the one we have every day.
- Oh, certainly, he's used to it, he's only too used to it. Come on, don't give me those revolving eyes; he's been nice today, very nice, let's leave it at that and talk about something else.
- Please, my dear friend," said the colonel, wiping his moustache, "we'll exhaust this subject first. Léopold must have had something to do with my journey.
Mme Massereau turned very red, then very pale. Mr Massereau poured himself another cup of coffee, sensing that the question was entering hot territory.
I think," said Mr Dauvellec gravely, "that it's time to send him to college.
- At school?" repeated Mme Massereau in a voice that was barely distinct.
- So young!" added Mr Massereau, who sympathised with his wife's emotion.
- In his father's will, it says that he will be placed there at the age of nine.
- That's terrible!" exclaimed Mme Massereau.
- She's there now. Last year, I wrote to you to remind you of my duty as guardian, and you seemed so sorry that I left him with you for another year. The year is over, my dear Caroline.
- My cousin, you said until he was stronger," exclaimed Mme Massereau.
- Sorry, I let you say that. I assure you I'm sorry to put you to this inconvenience.
- Until he was stronger," repeated Mme Massereau stubbornly; "that was the agreement.
- No agreement, my cousin, can replace the formal will of the head of the family, expressed in a legal will. As his guardian, I could not accept that, and besides, in this year that you asked for, he has not grown stronger, on the contrary.
- He has an excessively delicate temperament.
- It's a misfortune. Well, college life will get the better of that sensitivity.
- That's what it's made for!" exclaimed M. Massereau.
- First of all, Fortuné, you could never stand that poor child," cried Mme Massereau.
- My wife, what are you saying? I did suffer him; but I'm not hiding it from you, knowing that one day or other we'll be rid of him.
- From him!
- I mean from the responsibility, the very heavy responsibility for his future. If your poor nephew appointed the colonel as his son's guardian and absolute master, it's because he had his reasons.
- He knew you were so personal, so incapable of bringing up a child!
-- Come on, Caroline, tell us, just tell us, and it will be all right. He knew we were so incapable of bringing up a child! Frankly, my wife, it's not our doing and we don't have the grace of the state for that. You spoil little Léopold with indignity; I push him around and bully him for something he is quite innocent of. After all, what the hell! He hasn't brought peace to our household, that poor child. There's not a day goes by when I don't think he's too much.
Mr Massereau was in a hurry, he could not see all the spite that was building up between his wife's two smooth little headbands; but Mr Dauvellec sensed that one more word would unleash one of those marital storms he had sometimes witnessed, and, addressing the speaker:
My dear Massereau," he said, "I would ask you to let me deal with this delicate matter with my cousin, to whom I would be unhappy to cause the least pain. If you were to precede me to the notary's office to press his clerk's handwriting a little, you would be doing me a favour, as you know very well that I am leaving tomorrow.
- That's fine, you can send me away," said M. Massereau, grabbing his hat. My wife and I have never seen eye to eye on this. Let her sort out your ward with you.
And waving graciously, he left.
The colonel approached Madame Massereau:
Now let's talk reason," he said gently, "like people who are fulfilling a duty.
Having said that, he briefly explained why he was no longer willing to compromise his duties as guardian. He had missed the date set for Leopold's entry into college by almost two years; all careers now required an early start to education; the longer he waited, the harder college life would seem to the child: there was no point in hesitating any longer, any delay would be detrimental to him from every point of view.
It is only to explain this to you that I have come in person," he said in conclusion. You have dismissed all my letters. I know you will miss Leopold, but you will see him again during the holidays. I have no intention of taking him away from you; I'm simply fulfilling the mandate my sister gave me when she died.
Mme Massereau had listened to him with irritation.
I know very well that this will gives you every right," she said bitterly. In the family, it has always been like that. I've always been in charge, nothing else. I would have thought it fair if you had left Leopold to me until he was twelve.
The colonel nodded.
"But in any case, you're not asking for him back now; the holidays are about to start again.
- In eight days; but I thought I'd take advantage of my trip to take him to my brother's, where I'm only spending two days. I announced it.
Mme Massereau's face flushed with annoyance:
"Do you really want to go on this trip?
- Very much so, and I also want him to spend a few weeks' holiday with my children. The school regime will seem less harsh to him when he leaves a family where everything is somewhat military.
- You want to take him away from me, that's it.
- My dear cousin, it would be more accurate to say that you are obliged to give him back to me. Once again, bear in mind that I am the head of a large family, the father of four children, and that we have no need for a fifth. I'm only acting out of conscience, for the greater good of the child. In claiming him, I am strictly exercising the right conferred on me by his father's will.
- Oh, you have the law on your side, I know; otherwise there would be no reason for it. I know as well as anyone what is best for the people I care about, and I would not leave it to anyone else to make them happy. I do not bring up Leopold so badly. Has he ever lacked anything? I didn't take your letters seriously, I always thought that, since you had children of your own, you would leave him to me.
- I left him to you for two years, my cousin. It has been my strict duty to look after him for two years. Leaving him this year would be tantamount to dismissing me as guardian.
- Would you think of doing that?
- No: such a bequest is sacred, you never have the right to refuse it.
At this firm answer, Mme Massereau realised that she would not change the colonel's mind, and suddenly changed the subject of the conversation.
After a few minutes of ordinary conversation, they parted. The colonel went to join Mr Massereau at his solicitor's, after saying to Madame Caroline:
"You know I'm taking the one-thirty train tomorrow.
Which clearly meant:
"Don't forget to pack my ward's luggage.
Mme Massereau nodded in the affirmative, but no sooner had the colonel turned on his heels than she rushed down the corridor to meet Marie-Céline, exclaiming:
"He wants it, he absolutely wants it, but he's not going to get it!
III -- Game won
If there is one moment during the day when Léopold deserves his name of Monsieur Je veux, it is when he gets up. First of all, getting up is a big deal for the lazy boy.
It usually happens like this:
His aunt or Marie-Céline calls him once, twice, three times. He pretends to be asleep. We'll shake him.
He grumbles or laughs. Finally, here he is, wide awake, half-dressed, but already up to his neck in his whims. His godmother is washing him, which doesn't make her walk any faster. His foot is in the air as he pushes down his boot. "My cannon?" he shouts. He throws the boot in the air and hops off to look for a small cannon that he wants to screw onto his carriage. His godmother struggled to get her hands on him, and the grooming continued. But this unfortunate cannon, which had to be constantly changed hands, was a real mess. Mme Massereau finally tore it from his hands and threw it back into the toy box.
She only had time to turn away, Léopold had gone, and a spinning top swung between the poor godmother's legs. She caught him a second time and dragged him to the sink.
Then came a cascade of the child's favourite word: I want.
"I want ointment.
"I want to do my parting.
"I want to tie my tie.
This exercise in dressing like a spoiled child is certainly likely to give the person taking part a moral and physical ache, and yet Mrs Caroline loves it. When her husband turns up and shouts impatiently:
"Isn't it time you let that big boy dress himself?
She looks at him sideways and vehemently refuses to let him try. If Leopold dressed himself, he wouldn't need her any more: he'd just get used to doing without her. She has to dress him, and she will. Poor Mme Massereau! she doesn't know how to do the other kind of dressing, the dressing of character, the dressing of the heart. But that's an adornment that needs much more attention, and one that you can't do on your own either.
Oh, it's certainly very sweet to put on tiny feet and untangle silky hair, but that's only the smallest part of the mother's task. The feet grow, the hair quickly falls out under the scissors; love must grow too, and go all the way up to the soul. Then comes other care, even more delicate care. When a child's mind dresses itself, it runs the risk of dressing itself badly, and it is in great need of its mother's authority, if not her hand.
On the day of the colonel's departure, Marie-Céline was given the task of dressing Léopold. Mme Massereau, who had mysteriously left very early in the morning, had not returned by eight o'clock, and Léopold, bored himself under his sheets, had called Marie-Céline, who quickly rushed over.
Despite her haste, she was greeted by loud cries. Léopold thought she hadn't come quickly enough and was dressing furiously, upside down.
But, sir, you put your stockings on before your hat," Marie-Céline shouted as she saw him running barefoot and reaching for his hat.
- I want to wear my cap," he replied majestically.
- Put it on, it's funny; but if you like it, I don't care. Come on, sit down, here are your stockings.
- Fix them.
- Now both feet are in, come on, quickly.
- I want you to put them on yourself.
- Well, are you one-armed this morning? A man your age. You want it, that's fine. Give me your foot.
- Which foot?
- Any foot you like.
- Here's one; no, there's the other. Do you like this one better, or this one?
And her two feet alternately rose and fell in front of Marie-Céline's kneeling face.
I'm not going to stay here forever like Madame," she said at last; "what a little pretender you are!
- Ah! you call me a pretender; wait! wait!"
And the child, escaping, went and took a small riding crop and swung it around Marie-Céline, who began to run hither and thither, knocking over chairs, dragging clothes, laughing and cursing at the same time.
Is it all over?" she said at last, half laughing, half angry. If the colonel hears you, he'll come, you'll be very proud, and that will be well done.
At the very moment Marie-Céline uttered this threat, the door opened in front of Mme Massereau.
She was flushed and very worried.
Well," she said, "why did Léopold get up so early today?
- Madame, it's nine o'clock," replied Marie-Céline, glancing at the clock.
- The clock is ticking. I don't want him to get up this morning, he's ill.
- Me!" cried Léopold, jumping up and down over a stool.
- If you're not ill, the colonel will take you; you must go back to bed.
- No! oh! no.
- No, please don't.
- Will you serve me breakfast, godmother?
- Yes, yes, we'll make you some chocolate.
- And barbecue?
- And grilled meats, whatever you like. And you can play in bed when the colonel's not here. Come on, Marie-Céline, take off his jacket. He hasn't got any shoes on, it'll be over in no time. Why did you open the dressing room door? Do you want the colonel to hear everything that goes on here?
She went to listen and, hearing no noise, closed the door.
He's probably still asleep," she said, "he went to bed so late!
The colonel was not asleep; he was bearding himself in his own dressing-room, and had not lost a detail of the scene of Leopold's rising.
Some other time, don't leave that door open," recommended Mme Massereau as she returned to sit by the bed where Léopold had huddled, "it's very unwise when the yellow room is occupied."
She took a long breath and continued:
"I went to the telegraph this morning. I had arranged for my brother and his children to come and dine with us, which would have been a serious excuse for keeping Leopold. I waited an hour for a reply. My brother is at his plantation, and his wife told me that, as her little daughter had been taken ill with measles, she could not leave the house. This is a real setback. So I thought you could play sick for a while. There's no better way to stop travelling.
- Where will it hurt, godmother?" asked Léopold, smiling mischievously.
- Let's see. Here, under your chin, you've got a bit of congestion from your last bout of bronchitis. Then here, near your ear, there's a bit of red. Look, Marie-Céline; yes, it's red, it's very red.
- It's probably the effect of the whip, Madame. I think he hit himself when he tried to grab me.
- I assure you he has a rash and measles is around.
- I don't want to be really ill!" exclaimed Leopold in fright.
- You won't be, but you can sit still for a morning.
- Oh yes, and I could still get a toothache. Marie-Céline, go and make my chocolate.
- Serve the colonel's," added Mme Massereau; "I'm not sure whether he's having breakfast and we mustn't find Léopold eating.
Marie-Céline disappeared and soon appeared carrying a steaming bowl.
Godmother, here's my chocolate, my chocolate!" sang Léopold.
- Chut! chut!" said Mme Massereau, who arrived dragging a black crate bearing a large label with this address:
"Monsieur Léopold Massereau".
- My God," she said, "how time flies! It's half past! Hurry up, Léopold, if your uncle arrives!
- There he is!" said Marie-Céline; "I recognise his footsteps.
Mme Massereau only had time to pass the bowl to the edge of the alley and to throw over it, like a veil, the edge of the bed sheet.
Mr Massereau entered.
Well," he said, "what's become of that lazy colonel? I've been waiting for him in the square for an hour. God! and the child is still in his wallet! What's all this pretence, Caroline?
- Leopold is not well, my friend.
- I'm very ill," moaned Leopold, his head buried in his pillow.
- This illness has come on very suddenly, I must admit. Leopold, admit it to me, you went to eat in the kitchen and gave yourself indigestion. You're laughing under your breath, I can see it, it's not serious. My dear friend, there's only one way to get this child back on his feet very quickly, and that's to put him on a diet.
- He'll be on it all day, and it's always a good idea to go on a diet when you're feeling under the weather.
- It's the remedy of remedies", continued Mr Massereau, deceived by this feigned submission.
And walking along the side of Léopold's bed, he repeated:
"It's the remedy of remedies, I've always seen it applied successfully. When I was a child, doctors did not drug their patients as they do today. Diet, diet, diet, that was their great remedy.
As he said these words, he took two or three quick steps away from the bed.
Léopold leaned towards Mme Massereau.
Oh!" he sighed, "see how it smokes!
The chocolate vapour had penetrated the cloth and condensed into a small wavy column which would obviously betray them.
Fortuné," said Mme Massereau, walking in front of her husband, "the colonel is quite late, it seems to me. He may be indisposed, so go and see how he is.
- He's indisposed! He's a man of iron. However, I'm going to knock on his door.
He went out through the dressing room, and Mme Massereau, running to Léopold :
Drink quickly," she ordered.
- It's like with rats," said Léopold, sitting up.
He was no fool; he had often amused himself by reading the fables of La Fontaine, and, while enjoying his chocolate, he recited half aloud the one about the country rat dining with the city rat.
On any other occasion, Mme Massereau would not have failed to admire his wit, but at the moment his job as a lookout was absorbing all his faculties, and Léopold's erudition was making him impatient.
Just as she was placing the revealing cup in Marie-Céline's hands, M. Massereau and the colonel made their entrance. The officer's thick moustache twitched with laughter as he saw Léopold's dishevelled head buried in the pillow.
After wishing Mrs Massereau good morning, he turned towards the bed and asked:
"What time does my ward get up?
- Oh, Colonel, very early; he's a child who can't stay in bed once he's awake; but now he's taken with a... an indisposition, and obliged to keep the room.
- What's the matter?"
The colonel approached and looked gravely at Leopold, who stubbornly closed his eyes.
"He's been suffering from bronchial pains for a long time. You see, it's slightly blocked here, and this morning he had red patches on his skin.
- Well, he looks very well," said M. Massereau, who was looking at the patient through his glasses. Show us your tongue, kid.
Léopold obeyed as if reluctantly.
How loaded it is!" cried Mme Massereau.
- It's nothing, my cousin, don't be alarmed and make him get up.
- Ah, Colonel, I wouldn't dare until I'd seen the doctor. Just think what a chill could do! The poor child! I was determined to let him go with you: you see, his trunk is packed.
And Mme Massereau gestured to the small black box with the white label.
"Well, well, so it's not a joke!" grumbled M. Massereau, who was looking alternately at Léopold's pink face and his wife's stubborn face.
And, banging his cane on the parquet floor:
We'll see," he grumbled. Caroline, you'd better send for the doctor," he added, staring at her.
- I'll do it," she replied, calming Leopold with a gesture, who had jumped out from under his blankets at this word; "I'll send for him.
- There's no need: on our way to the notary's we'll pass his door," said the old man, put off by Leopold's movement.
- My goodness! Fortuné," said Mme Massereau, who was struggling to control her impatience, "don't meddle in matters that don't concern you and look after my cousin, who has no time to lose; you don't know how to run errands. This is my business, I've always looked after our patients, it's my speciality.
- It's all right, it's all right," grumbled M. Massereau, who was secretly annoyed to see the opportunity to be rid of the spoilt child slipping away; "we'll see. We have lunch at eleven, I believe?
- At eleven o'clock sharp.
- That's good, that's good. Are you coming, Dauvellec? I'm sure we'll find that kid on his feet when we get back.
And passing Mr Dauvellec in front of him, he slowly descended the old staircase.
As he passed the kitchen, he stopped.
Marie-Céline," he said half aloud, "did you have anything to do with inventing Léopold's illness?
- I don't invent anything, you know, not even the sauces you want.
- It's all right, you're joking, he's not ill. Just one question: has he had breakfast? It smells terribly of chocolate round here.
Marie-Céline laughed loudly.
When you're ill, sir, they serve you coffee," she said, "and when he's ill, he drinks chocolate.
- It's all right, he hasn't been put on a diet, he's not ill at all," grumbled M. Massereau; "it's a farce they're playing on us, a real farce.
And he joined the colonel.
While they went about their business, poor Mme Massereau remained the jailer of the spoiled child, who at first enjoyed his role as a patient, but was beginning to find it tiresome.
The poor woman had to use persuasion and force to keep him in bed, where his blind tenderness kept him until it was time to leave. Once or twice she had to call Marie-Céline to her aid, for Marie-Céline, with her cheerful way of putting things, found it easier to bring Léopold to his senses.
At last the eagerly awaited hour of breakfast struck, and Mme Massereau breathed a sigh of relief as she heard the footsteps of the two men on the stairs. Léopold lay quiet in his carefully tucked-in bed.
Well, how is the patient?" asked the colonel, walking straight towards him.
- His condition hasn't changed," replied Mme Massereau evasively.
- Does his teeth still hurt?" said M. Massereau.
- They still do.
- And the congestion hasn't lessened?
- No, on the contrary.
- Let's have a look.
Mme Massereau gently uncovered Léopold's neck, which was red from the agitation he had caused himself.
"He simply has blood in his head," said M. Massereau.
And, plunging his hand into the large pocket of his paletot, he added:
"The doctor I met told me that it would be nothing and that a little application of leeches would do the trick. I paid a visit to the chemist, and here are the two pretty little beasts that will give instant relief to our patient.
And he placed before Leopold's suddenly wide eyes a small vial containing two thin leeches.
The child sat up:
I don't want leeches!" he cried, "I'm not ill! I want to get up!
- The remedy is already working," said the colonel cheerfully.
- Mr Massereau sometimes has absolutely absurd ideas," said Mme Massereau, glaring at her husband. He wanted to frighten the child, that's all. Léopold, please go back to bed, you'll catch a cold. Your uncle is joking, it's just a joke.
But Leopold's eyes were fixed on the little vial his uncle was flashing in front of his eyes, and he answered resolutely:
"I want to get up, I'm not ill; it was you, godmother, who told me to be.
- Perfect, perfect!" cried M. Massereau, who was laughing himself to tears.
- That's enough joking," said Mme Massereau bitterly; "Léopold has been missing school for more than a fortnight because of his teeth, and I don't see any pleasure in being a nurse.
- Certainly not," said the colonel hastily, "especially with a patient of this kind. My cousin, don't worry, I've given up on taking Leopold to my brother's, it wouldn't be possible. But," he added in a firm voice, noticing the movement of joy that Mme Massereau could not contain, "the day I am settled in Coutances, I will send for him. He has to go to La Flèche at the end of the holidays, so he'll have to spend some time in quarantine with me. Otherwise he would never be able to soften under the necessary but inexorable discipline. I've given you every latitude in your role as his mother; please don't interfere unnecessarily with my no less serious role as his guardian.
- He'll go, I'm telling you," asserted M. Massereau, "what the hell! We won't wait for you to send the police for us. And now, let's go and have lunch, I can hear the little bell ringing. What are you doing with your patient, Caroline? I think the game is up, he can have lunch with us.
- He would delay us," replied Mme Massereau; "sick or not, he'll have lunch in his room.
And, approaching Léopold, who had already risen to protest, she slipped this seductive promise into his ear:
"We'll bring you everything you need for your bed, and after the colonel leaves I'll come and dress you. Don't say a word: he might take you away anyway."
Having said that, she joined the two guests, murmuring:
"We'll see! And besides, it's always time saved.
IV -- The drop of water
The streets of the little town of Châtel are so clean and shiny! Heavy rainstorms have replaced the sweeping that is often forgotten; they have removed every last speck of dust from the uneven cobblestones.
Big, swollen streams are still flowing in the gullies that have been poorly laid out in the middle of the narrow streets, and the storm of the previous day is being felt in sudden gusts that are turning umbrellas into big, ugly tulips, taking off the sturdiest hats and coquettishly turning up the muslin headdresses of the peasant women. It's market day, and people come to Châtel from the countryside against all the odds.
So it's quite simple for the sturdy peasants, with their hats secured on their heads by a handkerchief tied under their chins, and the farm women with their baskets full of fruit and vegetables to brave the gusts and showers. But one wonders why Mr Massereau so willingly exposes himself to this furious wind and why he strolls painfully through this open-air market, his right hand on his hat, which has already made many an excursion among the piles of new potatoes, and his left hand busy folding back the flaps of his frock coat, which are constantly caressing his face. Alas, it must be said, it is his main fault, gluttony, that leads him to this crowded square. The storm that stirs up the depths of the sea suddenly brings legions of fish to its surface; instantly there are abundant catches all along the coast, which spill over into all the neighbouring markets.
They're announcing a superb tide," said Mr Massereau to his wife that very morning, "and some of it will reach us. It's been a long time since I've eaten fresh fish, so I'm going to keep an eye out for it.
The arrival was not long in coming. Soon there were fishermen in their suroës, carrying large baskets full of mackerel. There were mackerel of all sizes, and as the merchants had travelled by night, the fish were still glistening and stiff.
Mr Massereau passed several times with an indifferent air between the slimy heaps; then suddenly spotting a very beautiful mackerel with shining eyes, and a blond sole of respectable thickness, he debated the price, gave his address, and returned home triumphantly.
Well, sir, are you going to bring us our lunch?" asked Marie-Céline, with a slightly mocking air.
- Uncle, do you have any fish?" asked Léopold at the same time, who was getting more and more involved in the cooking and the preparation of the menu.
- I've got some, I've got some, you're going to get some. First a sole that you will fry for dinner; then a superb mackerel that you will put on this morning, à la maître d'hôtel.
- Mackerel is much better fried!" exclaimed Léopold; "I suck the head, it's very good: I want it fried.
- Monsieur Je-veux has nothing to say here," grumbled Mr Massereau, pinching the ear of the spoilt child, who began to scream in rage.
And, turning to his wife who was entering, he said:
"Is this gentleman going to take charge of the kitchen now?
- But no, but no; leave him alone, Fortuné. What's the matter?
- I bought a mackerel and I want it for the maître d'.
- It will be there; why not?
- But, godmother, I prefer it fried," cried Léopold, clinging to her arms with both hands.
- Either way is perfectly fine," said Mme Massereau masterfully.
- I prefer mackerel à la maître d'hôtel.
- I want them fried!
M. Massereau moved towards the stubborn man, who ducked behind Marie-Céline's skirts.
Mme Massereau looked perplexed; since the colonel's visit she had not been able to resist even the slightest whim.
With all that you're keeping the fish out," said Marie-Céline, shrugging her shoulders; "has anyone ever said so much for a poor mackerel!
The merchant did indeed appear at the kitchen door, her fish in hand.
M. Massereau hastened to make room for her, but as he crossed the threshold of the kitchen he turned away.
Caroline, you know what my orders are," he said with an imperious gesture, "to the headwaiter.
And he walked away, pretending not to hear a small muffled voice saying:
"Fried, fried, fried!
There's one thing that children and young people will always lack, no matter how intelligent and penetrating God may have endowed them with: experience, in other words the science of life, practised personally. Léopold, who was not lacking in wit, was completely unaware of what experience teaches us, namely that the slightest drop of water is enough to make a full vase overflow. Mme Massereau was old enough and sensible enough to know this; but experience is often cancelled out by passion, and that's why we see people who, after having had their fingers roasted to the bone, are unwise enough to put their fingers back in the fire.
So both were careless. Léopold pursued his aunt with complaints backed up by hypocritical tenderness. Mme Massererau gave in and dragged along Marie-Céline, who was all set to make niches for her master on the days when he thought of touching her omnipotence as a buyer. Mme Massereau even had to tell her not to make their rebellion to formally given orders sound too loud.
Once he's chatted to these gentlemen, he'll stop thinking about this misery, I know it," she said. However, I invite you to cleverly slip your mackerel onto the table while talking about other things, and I forbid Leopold to point out that it is to his taste.
It is through this feminine diplomacy that storms in a glass of water are brewing.
The matter being thus arranged according to Mr Je-veux's wishes, little thought was given to it, and the clock having struck noon, the three guests found themselves around the table with their usual physiognomy: Mme Massereau looking busy, M. Massereau looking hungry, Léopold looking dissipated.
However, when the soup was removed and Mr Massereau saw Marie-Céline appear carrying a long dish at arm's length, he smiled and rubbed his hands together:
Hey," he said, "did you find my mackerel fresh?
- Fresh as dew, sir," replied Marie-Céline kindly, as she moved the terrible dish back and forth a little.
- Yes, I do! Come on, put the dish on the table, not in front of Mme Massereau, in front of me, in front of me. Pass me the trowel, Caroline, so that I can have the pleasure of serving.
He took the trowel and looked at Marie-Céline, who was still holding her dish, only to arouse her master's suspicions and gently prepare him for something unusual. All she had to do was obey this silent command. She slid down and placed the dish right in front of M. Massereau, saying with a clear air:
"This fish is so fresh, it's fragrant.
No sooner had Mr Massereau's eyes rested on the mackerel crisply fried in its blond sauce than his apoplectic face paled with anger.
He looked at his wife, then at Marie-Céline, then at Léopold, whose impertinent smile exasperated him to no end.
So I'm no longer the master of my house?" he said, pushing the plate away so violently that it flew across the table and landed on Mme Massereau's plate.
- But yes, Fortuné, but yes," replied the disconcerted wife, who had expected some recriminations, but not this outburst of fury.
- No, no!" he continued, banging the handle of his knife on the table, "it's Mr Jeveux who's in charge here now, and it won't be, no, it won't be!
- Come on, Fortuné, calm down and try some of this poor mackerel that's been fried because it's quicker.
- No; it's because it pleases the gentleman: the gentleman sucks his head!
And he burst out laughing ironically.
"Ah, that's a bit strong, too strong, really! Don't offer me any, I won't eat it. Serve me the second course.
All his entreaties failed against his decision not to touch the fish, and his discontent did not subside at dessert. He drank the coffee with a sombre and quite tragic air, then passed into his study without honouring his wife with a glance.
It's been a long time since I've seen him so angry," said Madame Massereau to Marie-Céline, who had come to find out about his outburst of temper.
- I'll make him doughnuts," said Marie-Céline condescendingly.
- That's a great idea; he asks for them every day, it'll take his mind off his mackerel.
While they were arranging to disarm him, M. Massereau, sitting at the tidy desk that was hardly of any use to him, wrote the following note in very sloppy handwriting
"My dear Colonel,
"Basically, I have always conspired with my wife to prevent you from taking back your ward. When the time came to separate, I allowed myself to be circumvented by her lamentations. But things are going from bad to worse for the child. (Here the fried mackerel came vividly to the old man's mind; and after a pause, he continued with a feverish hand:) The treats are too much and it's high time he left us. My wife and I don't have what it takes to bring up a child. So send for him so that I can be rid of this unpleasant business as soon as possible. I'll lend you a hand, of course.
"I shake your hand cordially.
"MASSEREAU.
M. Massereau sealed this letter, wrote the address and left his office, his hat on his head and his cane in his hand.
As chance would have it, he found Mme Massereau and Marie-Céline in his path. Mme Massereau was noisily putting away a tea service, Marie-Céline was dusting the banister of the staircase. He passed stately and sombre, without saying a word to them.
No sooner had the door to the street closed behind him than Mme Massereau appeared on the landing's balustrade.
He's not as angry as he wants to look," she said.
- I don't know, madame; but it seems to me, on the contrary, that he has been giving a very evil eye to Leopold who, always disobedient, has drawn himself to watch him go by.
- The poor child will certainly sulk for a long time. God! how selfish men are!
V -- Let's go!
A fortnight after this little scene, Mme Massereau received a short note from Colonel Dauvellec, enjoining her in very polite but clear terms to take Léopold to Rennes, where his servant would be waiting to take him to Coutances.
Her first thought was to resist this formal request; her second to evade it; but for that she would have needed the usual complicity of M. Massereau, and M. Massereau declared that he would drive Léopold himself if his wife did not resign herself to it.
On this subject, Mr Massereau delved into the legalities. The colonel's request was entirely legal; he had always had the right to do what he liked with Léopold, and there was now no reason to keep him. The matter of his education was the exclusive concern of his guardian, and if he had been willing to leave the care of his early childhood to his aunt, that was no reason to allow himself to keep him any longer.
Mme Massereau wrote and telegraphed, but obtained no extension. Decidedly, the guardian remained inexorable. What was most unusual was to see Léopold suddenly turn against his godmother's wishes. After saying in every tone and stamping his foot: "I don't want to go!" he suddenly said, no less energetically: "I want to go! The mere idea of a trip had turned his capricious will on its head.
There was so much talk in front of him about this journey that he had a great desire to travel the world. He had never made a journey of more than a league by rail, and he knew very well that one never travelled for longer than that in the house.
Mme Massereau, abandoned by her natural allies, even by Marie-Céline who was excessively annoyed by Léopold, had to give in, and one fine morning she left Châtel to take Léopold to Rennes, where Mr Dauvellec's trusted servant was waiting for him.
Her grief was softened by the intimate hope that he would be returned to her without delay.
The colonel and his wife don't know much about children," she always told Marie-Céline confidentially. A restless, strong-willed child like Léopold will tire them out very quickly. Within a week, they'll send him back to me, finding him intractable.
The way Léopold travelled was just the thing to strengthen her hope: he was absolutely unbearable. He rushed headlong into the carriages, boldly took the corner seat, opened and closed the skylight as he pleased, and irritated all the passengers to no end. Mme Massereau spent her time putting scarves on him when he liked to keep his head outside to feel the wind, he said; making sure he didn't crush the feet of his fellow passengers when he flew through the carriage; scolding him lightly and kissing him ardently. Mr Massereau smiled equivocally, hid his feet under the seat, but said nothing.
At the moment of being rid of the little tyrant, he could well be magnanimous.
He nevertheless breathed a deep sigh of relief when the train arrived at Rennes station, and hurried towards the buffet where Léopold was to meet his driver. Mme Massereau followed no less eagerly. Her last letter was written in such desperate terms that she had secretly hoped that the colonel would grant her the holiday that was about to begin. As she crossed the threshold of the buffet, her face revealed that she had been deluding herself, and her gaze fell disgruntled and troubled on a man of about forty, wearing a silver-rimmed cap and smoking phlegmatically from a large wooden pipe.
M. Massereau had walked up to him and, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, said:
Ah, my good Choucroute," he said, "you don't seem to suspect that the train has arrived.
The man removed both his pipe from between his teeth and his cap from over his close-cropped red hair, which made his head look like a wilted chestnut shell.
The boy told me that the train from Saint-Malo was arriving," he replied. Where is the gentleman?
- There, in front of the buffet; he's deciding on his lunch menu, no doubt.
Léopold led his godmother to the table where the day's food was laid out.
He devoured the pink hams, the golden poulardes and the sausages wrapped in lead paper with his little greedy eyes. Mme Massereau, who was having difficulty recovering from the unpleasant impression that the sight of Guillaume Rischen, known as Choucroute, had made on her, looked blankly at the maître d', who, armed with a cutlass with a shiny blade, was skilfully removing large slices of superb roast beef.
"What are your orders, my good man?" asked Mr Massereau as he sat down opposite Choucroute.
The soldier took a piece of paper from his waistcoat pocket and handed it to him.
Mr Massereau put on his magnifying glass and read the contents carefully.
It's very precise," he said; "as brief and concise as an instruction.
Noticing a boy passing by, he added:
"Tell me, how long do we have until the first train leaves for Normandy?
- Forty minutes, sir.
Mr Massereau gestured to his wife.
Caroline, you've got plenty of time to get Leopold to breakfast," he said, smiling amiably.
- Would you like him not to have breakfast now?
- God forbid! I've never wanted to starve anyone, and Leopold has a bill to pay that needs his strength. So you'd better order lunch; forty minutes will soon be up.
And, turning to Sauerkraut, he added:
"And turning to Sauerkraut, he added: "Are you well weighted, my good fellow?
Sauerkraut inclined his head in the affirmative.
Let's go, let's go," said Mr Massereau as he walked briskly towards a small table with four place settings, "make your menu, Léopold; one last time, order your lunch, my boy.
Léopold returned with his aunt to the centre table; then he stopped in front of the long marble counter which held the dessert items, and, the choice having been made, lunch began.
Mr Massereau and Léopold ate with great appetite. As for Mme Massereau, she only paid attention to Léopold.
That's it, cut his meat for him," said Mr Massereau, not without a touch of irony; "look for the best piece and give him all the sauce. Perfect, perfect! Let him enjoy the rest.
- If he's too unhappy with his guardian, he'll write to me and I'll go and fetch him," said Mme Massereau, who seemed even more irritated than sorry.
- Then you'll have to plead, because he does have the right and the duty to look after him.
- Men have made the law for themselves, for themselves alone; it's absurd!
M. Massereau, who was nibbling on a chop, smiled into his beard. It was to this blessed law that he owed his deliverance from the spoilt child who had come to disturb his quiet life, and he admired it with all his heart.
When does our train leave?" he asked, hoping to make a transition.
- I'm staying in Rennes tonight," said Mme Massereau imperiously.
- Bah!
- I wouldn't have bothered for nothing. I wrote to my cousin that we would be staying with her this evening.
- You mean me too?
- As you like. You can go back to our old house at Châtel if you like. As for me, I need something to distract me and I'm staying in Rennes for a few days.
- Well, let's stay," said Mr Massereau courageously. Where are you off to, Léopold?
- To see the trains arrive," he said; "I'm bored here.
- Very kind, very kind," said M. Massereau, handing his cup to the waiter who appeared with an enormous coffee pot in his hand. What surprises me is that you didn't think to ask for coffee.
- I want some, I want some, Uncle, with lots of sugar.
- Here, sugar yourself," said Mr Massereau magnanimously, pushing the little metal saucers towards the child.
The latter threw several lumps into the bottom of a cup; then he drank a few gulps of coffee, made a terrible grimace, declared that it was very bad and ran off.
Caroline, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on him," said M. Massereau.
- That would be a very small misfortune.
- Ah, you know, as you wish. There's also the machines he'll run in front of, the parcels he'll climb on and tumble down, the trains that leave; but whether he kills himself or cripples himself, that's none of my business.
Mme Massereau had flinched; Mr Massereau's sentence had not been finished when she got up and followed Léopold.
Mr Massereau gestured to Choucroute, who was still smoking.
"Go and get the tickets and stand on the platform so that you can warn us when the train arrives at the station. Because if we don't get it right, the hell with it.
- My colonel told me to arrive today," replied Choucroute, "I have to arrive today.
- Always faithful to orders! Well, it's very useful, the instructions: I'm counting on you.
And M. Massereau resumed sipping the cognac that had replaced the coffee in his cup. From time to time he looked up at the dial in front of him.
Suddenly his wife's piercing voice roused him from his rest.
Fortuné, what are you doing here?" she said; "come on!
- Good! good!" he grumbled, hastily picking up his cane, hat and gloves; "is she afraid she'll miss the train too? I could have sworn that was her firm intention.
He joined Mme Massereau on the platform, who was running here and there, showing signs of the greatest concern.
Léopold had slipped through her fingers; despite his defences, he had imagined crossing the tracks and had disappeared completely.
He did something that is forbidden by all the regulations," replied Mr Massereau gravely, "but don't worry, the employees will bring him back to us by the ears.
- Don't worry, you're fine!" cried Mme Massereau; "as long as you're not disturbed, everything's fine. I called you to look for him with me and this servant, who is really very obliging.
- My dear friend, I'm no longer strong enough to run a steeplechase among the bales and tenders. I need permission to follow this devil wherever he has gone. Besides, here comes a train. By golly, it's the Normandy train; I've been told it only has to stop here for five minutes. If Choucroute doesn't get hold of Léopold immediately, they'll miss him. Don't get worked up: what's the point of running out in front of this locomotive? it didn't fall on the tracks. But I'm very much afraid that, frightened of seeing it coming, he has taken shelter in some carriage where he won't be discovered until it's too late.
- If I were sure he was in no danger," exclaimed Mme Massereau, "I wouldn't care if he missed the train!
- Not to me, not to me," grumbled M. Massereau between his teeth.
And, fear shaking his usual apathy, he began to pace the platform, questioning the staff and inspecting the rooms through the wide glass doors. Soon the movement subsided and the sound of closing doors could be heard.
Mr and Mrs Massereau met up again, out of breath, at the door of the buffet from which they had started.
Suddenly the old man's face lit up.
He's got it!" he said, "they'll be off.
Choucroute had just emerged from behind the line of carriages stopped on the track.
He was running, stepping over the rails and carrying Léopold by the belt with his fingertips. He only had time to rush into the first carriage of the departing train.
Wait!" cried Mme Massereau; "don't go, don't go!
- Go, go!" said Mr Massereau, waving his cane.
Mme Massereau wanted to rush off, but the train was moving. She saw Léopold's dishevelled head laughing in a doorway.
"Ma bonne amie, il est embarqué, il est parti, c'est bien fini," said M. Massereau kindly, rounding his arm into a basket handle.
But Mme Massereau did not deign to take the arm that was so graciously presented to her. Her eyes fixed on the moving train, she waved and waved, and when it disappeared she abruptly turned her back on her husband and walked at a gymnastic pace towards the exit.
It'll pass, it'll pass," murmured M. Massereau as he rushed after her; "but, my God, it's about time that devil of a child left!
VI -- The arrival
While his uncle and aunt headed for Rennes, one grumbling, the other jubilant, Léopold continued on his way to Normandy. Slightly disturbed by the shameless way in which Choucroute had snatched him from the top of a pyramid of crates he liked to climb, he had very wisely spent an hour on the railway, examining his guard's face out of the corner of his eye. It was, incidentally, the best face in the world, and Leopold judged that there was no danger in showing himself for what he was. So he made the rest of the journey as pleasantly as he liked.
What did it matter to Sauerkraut that the skylights were suddenly lowered to let in the air and the dust? What did he care about the feet that kept knocking against his thick boots? They were just a little boat skimming along the side of the motionless ship. At the buffet, he obeyed Leopold passively, sometimes looking surprised to see him piling up the sweets and eating everything upside down, ham after cakes. He had obviously received precise orders about this, because he let it happen, phlegmatically opened his purse and paid without saying a word. Léopold, having done everything he wanted without any control, arrived in Coutances with a well-conditioned head cold and the beginnings of indigestion, due to his fanciful diet.
When the colonel, who was waiting for him on the station platform, approached him, he greeted him with a series of sneezes.
You look terrible, my pupil!" said M. Dauvellec, after kissing him affectionately. You must need your bed. Come on, let's get you some rest. Choucroute, I'll leave it to you to sort out the luggage. Come along, Leopold; your cousins are here, very eager to meet you.
Léopold, still sneezing, followed his uncle piteously. He was shivering, and the fear alone of finding himself seriously indisposed gave him the beginnings of nausea.
At the glass door, a tall boy dressed in the elegant uniform of the Borda, another shorter one wearing that of the Prytanée Militaire de la Flèche, both with the most intelligent faces, received him very cordially with good handshakes and words of welcome that he would never have known how to say.
Father, how do we get back home?" asked Edouard, the eldest, who had a shadow of blond moustache above his lips.
- On foot, on foot; it's only a walk, and Choucroute is taking care of the luggage.
- My cousin looks very tired.
- Yes, he looks very pale. Would you rather take the omnibus, Leopold?
- Yes, Uncle.
- And you, my children?
- We're going on foot," replied the two boys.
They shook hands with Leopold once more, and set off happily arm in arm, like the two good brothers they were.
The colonel lifted Leopold into the omnibus that stopped in front of his door, sat down beside him, and the carriage drove off into the night.
A quarter of an hour later, Leopold stopped blind on the threshold of a flat full of light, in front of one of those interior paintings that delight the heart as well as the eyes.
On a sofa, an elderly woman with a peaceful forehead crowned with white hair had her arm resting on the shoulder of a graceful twelve-year-old girl sitting next to her. In the armchair opposite her, a woman with a young but serious face cradled on her lap a sturdy little boy who was only half asleep.
This is cousin Fédik," said Madame Dauvellec, shaking the little sleeper.
- Where? where? where?" cried the child, leaping to his feet.
Mme Dauvellec took Léopold by the hand, who seemed quite intimidated, and led him first to his mother-in-law, who kissed him tenderly, and then to the little boy, who jumped on her neck.
We must get Léopold to supper as soon as possible," said the colonel, "he can't stand up.
Mme Dauvellec, who was usually called Mme Eugénie, to distinguish her from her mother-in-law, took Léopold's hand again; little Alfred took his other hand, and they left the salon together.
The poor child will be very disconcerted for the first few days," said Mme Dauvellec kindly.
- Not shy," replied the colonel, laughing. Poor Monsieur Je-veux! He doesn't feel he's on his own ground any more, it's disorientating him. Amélie, it would be kind of you to go and keep him company; I'm counting on you a little to tame him.
The little girl obeyed eagerly, but as she opened the door, her mother came in.
My friend," she said, "you'd better get your ward to bed as quickly as possible. He looks very bad. Suspecting something, I questioned Choucroute, whose account confirmed my suppositions. All Leopold needs this evening is a hot cup of tea and to go to bed as soon as possible. He's verging on indigestion.
- Don't worry, I'll give him that," said the colonel. Ah, my dear woman, we'll have to fight hard to reform this little man; but I hear a bell ring announcing Edouard and Gustave, I think. Yes, it's them. Mother, please keep them here; their kindness would hasten the catastrophe. Fédik is enough for Leopold this evening.
With these words, the colonel passed into the dining room, where Leopold was moping over a dish he dared not touch.
Eat, cousin," said little Alfred, brandishing a fork, "it's good stew, very good stew.
- A cup of tea will suit his stomach better," said the colonel. Fédik, take the candlestick and we'll take Leopold to his flat.
A quarter of an hour later, Leopold was lying comfortably in a pretty little room, and his aunt was bringing him tea, which he drank resignedly. Allred, standing on tiptoe, looked at him with tender curiosity and said little jokes that did nothing to lighten the worried brow of the poor spoilt child, who was horribly afraid of being left alone. At his request, Choucroute and a lighted candle were left with him, one of his habits being that he couldn't stand the dark.
Sauerkraut was also very attentive. Remembering Léopold's meals at the buffet, he never took his eyes off him, and at the slightest movement he would rush over to a bowl and place it under his nose.
Léopold would push it away furiously. In the midst of this pantomime, he fell asleep.
VII -- The first day
The next morning, Léopold thought he was dreaming when he woke up in this elegant and silent little room. It was no longer the hoarse voice of Marie-Céline, or the high-pitched voice of his godmother, ringing in his ears, but a clear little child's voice chirping sacred words in the next flat.
Alfred got up, dressed, and said his prayers on his knees, a little more quickly than usual, as he was waiting for Léopold to wake up, which distracted him.
It was he who greeted him first, and the heart of the spoilt child had to be hardened already not to feel touched by this childish kindness.
But Leopold, having never thought of anyone but himself, was full of selfishness, and poor little Fédik was very surprised to receive nothing in response to his advances and kindnesses but ill-humoured gestures. On one occasion, Léopold even went so far as to stick out his tongue at him, which seemed to Fédik to be the height of originality. But with his quick wit he found an excuse for this ugly grimace.
Mummy makes me show my tongue when I'm ill," he said to Leopold, "so you're ill again today?
Léopold couldn't help laughing and thought Fédik was a silly little boy.
Edward, Gustave and Amélie showed him round the house and, after the second breakfast, took him to the lawn where they used to play.
They put him on the swings and stilts and tried to make him smile. He played as he always did, without wanting to lose and choosing the best place for everything.
When Choucroute appeared, waving a little bell that signalled the end of playtime, Léopold was astonished to see his cousins immediately put their games away, as if they had been in a school playground.
Mme Dauvellec appeared at the window of a ground-floor flat, a small book in her hand.
Come on, Fédik," she said with a smile, "it's time for your lesson.
But Fédik had seen the movement of boredom that had escaped Léopold, and, rushing to the window :
Oh, good Mummy," he cried, "since Leopold is here, I must have a holiday today.
-- Let's have a holiday," cried Edouard and Gustave, bursting into laughter.
Mme Dauvellec turned towards the back of the flat, and the colonel immediately appeared at her side. He looked up at the sky, which was admirably clear, and said:
"We are approaching the holidays; in honour of Leopold, I am granting a day's leave."
Two caps and a small straw hat flew into the air at this kind word.
But on condition that we take a long walk," continued the colonel, "when the mind rests, the legs must move. Get ready, my children.
He turned away and asked his wife:
"Will you come, Eugénie?
- Oh no," she said, "it's too hot, but you'd better take Amélie with you. The doctor told me again that she needs exercise, fresh air; he even added the seaside.
-- That's the real remedy," said the good mother seriously; "I've always told you, there's only one remedy for the physical sluggishness brought on by the concentrated life of cities: the sea or the fields. For three years now you have not been able, because of the necessities of your position, to give your children the benefits of a whole season spent in the countryside. This year, it would be imprudent to deny them that. Édouard is growing inordinately, as is Amélie, and intellectual work is beginning to absorb their physical strength to the detriment of their future health. We should always remember the words of the philosopher: A healthy soul in a healthy body.
- Mother, you're right," says M. Dauvellec no less seriously. I'm off to see this gentleman who has a brother in Valognes, and whose project we were very excited about in the spring. He lives quite far from here, which will be our destination for a walk, and we can take Fédik with us.
The colonel, like all soldiers, was very prompt in his preparations for the excursion. A quarter of an hour later, he left the house with his daughter on his arm, his two eldest sons by his side and Léopold, who was holding Fédik's hand. Léopold thought it was too hot to go outside and would have liked to sleep under the arbour, but he didn't dare put up any open resistance.
The walkers did not return until dinnertime. They seemed to be in a cheerful mood, except for Leopold who dragged his leg with affectation. To his shame, it was said that Alfred had borne the fatigue better than he had.
While dining, the colonel reported on his visit. What had been proposed to him in terms of resorts close to the sea baths had displeased him in some respects. On the contrary, the only project that had not been insisted upon had seemed to him to be suitable. One of the nearest beaches was Darville, six leagues from Valognes. But there were only Norman inns and not a single hotel.
We'll go and see, Eugénie," he said as he finished; the Normandy inns are large and generally clean. What more do we need for a month or six weeks? There you will live with your family and in freedom.
At this promise, all the young heads warmed up, and the most seductive plans were immediately developed.
Édouard and Gustave began a dissertation on the most pleasant way of fishing; Amélie asked them to imagine a sledge, which would enable Granny to travel on sand from which she could not remove her feet. As for the house, who cares? We'll pitch a tent and live under it. All this enthusiasm lasted until bedtime. Naturally, it was Alfred who led the way: he would kindly ask everyone for an evening kiss, then obediently follow his mother.
That evening, he was more animated than usual; he made a few arrangements to say his prayers and go to bed. Mme Eugénie was obliged to put on a stern face to get him to put on his bonnet: he had imagined sleeping bare-headed like his brothers.
When he found himself properly draped in his white little bed, he gave his mother his usual good-night smile and held out both arms to kiss her.
"Now," she said, leaning over and speaking low, "tell me, my little Fédik, who taught you to say 'I want' so often?
- Only me," he replied.
- Fédik, if you don't tell me the truth, I won't kiss you before I go.
He put his little hands together.
"Mother," he said quietly, "it's Leopold who always says 'I want'.
- That's his own name; you know very well that he's called M. Je-veux. But I forbid you to imitate Leopold. I saw you sticking your tongue out at Sauerkraut. Did he also teach you to do that?
- Yes; when we don't go where he wants, he sticks his tongue out at me; that's naughty, Mum.
- Very bad, but he'll get over it. Good evening, my Fédik.
- Good evening, Mother; please don't scold Leopold.
- Not yet, I won't, don't worry.
Mme Dauvellec went into the small adjoining room.
Léopold was in bed pretending to be asleep.
Already?" she said, running her hand gently over the child's forehead; "it hasn't been long since you said your prayers.
Leopold did not reply.
"You don't pray, perhaps?
- Yes, in my bed," he answered embarrassedly.
- That's treating God very lightly. Well, we'll see about teaching you that. Good night, my poor child, sleep well.
She kissed him and left the room, looking worried.
VIII -- A pretty project
Eight days had passed since Léopold's arrival in Coutances. His initial astonishment had disappeared, but not his character flaws. Habit, which becomes second nature, is slow to uproot, even at the age of ten, and the poor spoilt child was experiencing this. His first move was always to disobey an order when it displeased him; his first word was always "I want", as if at his age one knew how to want according to wisdom and reason. The discipline that reigned in the colonel's house forced him to repress his first movement of resistance; but he obeyed reluctantly, he resisted underneath. If there was no way of repeating "I want" out loud twice, he would say it in a low voice, repeat it mischievously and the nickname would stick.
Madame Eugénie had great difficulty in preventing Fédik from conjugating this dangerous verb vouloir, so beautiful in the mouth of a man fulfilling a duty, so ridiculous in the mouth of a child.
Léopold was kept under very close surveillance. Édouard and Gustave ruthlessly brought him to his senses; Amélie, gentle and persuasive, tried to bring him to an obedience similar to her own, all love and condescension. As for Fédik, he was hardly ever allowed to have tête-à-tête with his cousin, as he always came back from them full of insubordination.
Fortunately, Fédik was still at the happy age when one does not think of giving the slightest disguise to one's thoughts. He repeated loudly everything that Leopold said softly, and sometimes understood nothing of the colonel's severe airs or the admonitions that his mother addressed to Leopold about him.
One day, he came to his good mother in tears and looking very animated, and threw himself around her neck:
Léopold is wicked," he said, "I don't love Léopold any more.
- Why?" asked Mme Dauvellec.
- He put on your glasses, Granny, and your shawl, and he said you were old.
- He told the truth, my little child; I am old, indeed, very old.
- No, no, no, no," Fédik said four times, kissing his grandmother's wrinkled cheeks.
- Yes, yes", replied the grandmother, smiling.
But then, in a serious tone, she added:
"And that's why I'm entitled to respect, and what your poor cousin Leopold lacks is respect. He's not a bad child, I know that; but he's a bad child, a spoilt child, and we won't allow our little Alfred to be like him. When he says things that you know are not well said, you must leave him at once and come and play at Granny's house.
- That's because, Granny, it's great fun to have a playmate. I don't have any; Edouard and Gustave are too big: Léopold is my playmate.
- He'll be my playmate when he's outgrown his bad habits of disobedience. Does he always say 'I want to'?
- Always", replied Fédik gravely.
The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Édouard, Gustave and Amélie, who rushed into the flat like an avalanche.
We're leaving for Darville," said three voices in unison.
- Me too?" asked Alfred, whose little face lit up.
- You too, everyone, even Dad: he's got his leave.
Léopold, who had come in after them, looked at them in amazement, not understanding their joy. He was still unfamiliar with joy, the true joy of childhood, which is born and sparkles from nothing.
Léopold, do you know the sea?" Amélie asked him graciously as she joined him in his corner.
- Yes," he said, "I've seen it.
- Don't you love it?
Léopold looked at her with a sneer that was quite silly. He loved everything that served his little selfish pleasures, but what was the point of loving the sea?
The sea is very beautiful," continued Amélie thoughtfully.
- It's very big," added Édouard.
- It's superb," added Gustave; "a walk on the sea is the most charming thing in the world.
- And when you're drowning?" remarked Léopold cautiously.
Édouard and Gustave burst out laughing.
Don't worry, if you fall in the water, I'll fish you out," cried Édouard.
- We'll teach you to swim," added Gustave.
- No, no, no, I don't want to swim," said Léopold, shivering.
- Well, I'll go swimming with Choucroute," said Alfred, standing up resolutely in front of Granny.
- Fédik, you're a brave man," said Édouard, placing his hand on his head.
As he said this, Choucroute opened the door and said:
"These gentlemen's coach is waiting for them.
- Choucroute, you're piercing my heart," said Édouard with a tragic gesture.
- Now for a dip in the theorem," groaned Gustave.
They waved goodbye to Mme Dauvellec and disappeared.
Come on, Amélie, tell me how this departure was decided," said Mme Dauvellec, drawing her granddaughter to her, "because I don't understand any of this.
- No, Mummy, you'll see. I was with Edouard and Gustave in the study, watching them do a physics experiment, when the door to Dad's study opened and a gentleman I don't know came in.
"It's a done deal," said Dad; "I beg you to rent the flats you visited; my leave has just come through, I'm free."
"The gentleman left him, and papa having seen us listening with all our ears, added before closing the door again:
"My children, I have the pleasure of announcing that we will shortly be talking about Darville.
- What does that mean, shortly?" asked Alfred, who had been listening very carefully to his sister's story.
- It means soon, very soon.
- Is it tomorrow then?
- It could be tomorrow, it could be in a week.
- Here's Daddy, he's probably going to tell us," said Amélie as she rushed to the door, which opened in front of the colonel.
He smiled and ran his fingers through his daughter's beautiful hair:
"Has someone come to tell Granny the news?
- Yes, Father, but I don't know how to tell her when we're leaving.
The colonel moved closer to Mme Dauvellec.
I've just spoken to Eugénie about this little matter," he said. "If you don't mind, Mother, we'll be leaving on Monday.
- Oh, my good mother, please don't see any obstacles!
And the good grandmother replied with a smile:
"I can't see a shadow of it, my little girl.
- Monday, Monday, we're leaving on Monday!" cried Amélie joyfully; "do you hear, Fédik? it's for Monday.
And she immediately added:
"Édouard and Gustave would be very happy to know that.
- I heard the voice of their tutor," said M. Dauvellec, "they're working, they mustn't be disturbed.
- Father, I won't disturb them," said Amélie, "I have a way of communicating with them without causing the slightest inconvenience.
- How can you do that? You're not allowed to enter the room when the coach is there.
- Oh, I don't go in, but I tell them what I want to tell them anyway: Father, allow me this little pleasure.
Léopold looked at Amélie with astonishment: in his profound selfishness, he did not understand that this little girl always wanted to share her pleasure with her brothers.
Go on," said Mr Dauvellec, laughing, "try your way, provided you don't break my orders and seriously disturb your brothers' work.
- Come, Fédik," said Amélie. Father, don't worry.
She led Alfred to the door that opened into the study room, spoke to him in a low voice, then opened the door very gently. The little man slipped through the crack with so little noise that Édouard and Gustave, who were looking at a blackboard on which a tall man with glasses was tracing geometrical figures, did not turn away.
"Hum! hum!" coughed a small voice.
This time they looked up.
"We're leaving for the sea on Monday," said Alfred, shaking his little head.
As he said this, he disappeared through the doorway, and the door closed without a sound.
IX -- The Silver Anchor Inn
It's a lovely day for families when they all embark on a pleasure trip. This time the whole Dauvellec clan was on the move, from Grandma to Fédik and Choucroute.
The journey to Darville was delightful.
Crammed into the Valognes carriage, our travellers patiently or cheerfully put up with the inconveniences of the mode of transport. Only Léopold would put on a scowl when Alfred, suddenly lifted by a bump, fell back onto his lap.
The poor spoilt child's stubborn and dull resistance had not yet been touched, not by the colonel's just severity, not by Mme Eugénie's gentle reprimands, not by Mme Dauvellec's maternal advice, nor by Amélie's delicate attentions. Amélie, however, flattered herself that she would obtain some concessions from the intractable Je-veux. In this he had been only too fair. Amélie had spared him many punishments; she had often rescued him from the swift justice of Édouard and Gustave, who were happy to let their mischief go unchallenged, but who would not allow a hair of Alfred's head to be touched. Alfred was their favourite child and, knowing Léopold, they kept a close eye on him all the more as the little brother was very fond of his company. He was closer to Alfred's age than they were, very childlike, though very tyrannical, and he naturally sought out the companionship of the little boy, who was very playful and passionate in his games.
This is why, during the journey, Alfred voluntarily placed himself in the carriage next to Léopold, and stayed there, even though Léopold responded by grimacing at his kind words and by slapping his little body when the carriage jolted.
When the crew pulled into the little village of Darville, Édouard and Gustave, seated on the seat, gave a cheer that was repeated by Alfred inside.
They got out in all haste, and the children, led by Mme Eugénie, immediately ran to the path which bordered the golden sandy shores that had just been discovered.
The customs officer on duty turned twice to look at the new arrivals, but that was all. This solitude enchanted Mr and Mrs Dauvellec; they immediately thought that they had chosen their resting place well, and that their children, and Amélie in particular, would be free to romp. Léopold himself deigned to smile when his feet touched the soft, shiny sand, and let Gustave draw him into a few jubilant gambols. But his sullenness returned when, following in Choucroute's footsteps, he entered the Auberge de l'Ancre d'Argent, a rustic house, the largest in the village, whose entire first floor had been reserved for the Dauvellec family. He took a pitiful look at the unpainted walls, the beamed ceilings and the poor varnished pine furnishings. He didn't dare express his disdain, because the hostess, a tall, lanky woman wearing the cotton bonnet she had imported to Darville, said loudly and in a tone that would not have suffered contradiction:
"See, madam, if these aren't nice rooms with good beds and white curtains. Every summer I put up posh ladies, and you wouldn't be better off in any other town. No, I wouldn't.
- The rooms are big, indeed," replied Mme Dauvellec; "I'd prefer them to be smaller; we'd find it hard to fit in.
And, ignoring the hostess's mute denials, she set off across the floor, assigning places to everyone. She was greatly embarrassed: there were neither enough flats nor enough beds.
She was repeating her calculations for the third time when Mr Dauvellec arrived. He listened wordlessly to his wife's objections, walked with her around the floor and, stopping in a large room with no chimney and the most uneven lighting in the world through uneven windows, said:
For a camp, this will be quite sufficient," he said, "but we must put all our boys in this flat. By organising this room, it will be possible to accommodate us. There are two beds, four of them, it's perfect.
- But Léopold, my friend?
- Leopold will be a bit awkward like everyone else: the beds are very big, one will be to the north, the other to the south; if they argue, it's because they want to.
With these categorical words, Mr Dauvellec took a wide-brimmed panama hat in place of his embroidered kepi and set off along the shore to do what he called a reconnaissance.
The four children followed him eagerly.
Léopold, very unhappy with the proposed arrangement, lay on the sand in the sun like a big lizard, and it was in vain that Alfred pulled successively on his arms and feet to force him to follow them.
Edouard, slightly annoyed by little Fédik's insistence, finally lifted her onto his strong arm and, sitting her on his shoulder, joined his father, on whose arm Amélie had been hanging.
It was a very hot day, but the blue of the sea rested the eyes, and during the rest stops, the walkers could admire the pretty crenellated tower of Lanneville, in its thick, dark shadows. When they reached the unfinished causeway, which reflected the desire to give the little village the importance of a port, they stopped for a long time.
Before them lay the Chausey islands, and the colonel, pointing to a bluish spot in the distance, called it Jersey. Then the walk continued, and when Amélie showed signs of tiredness, they had the glossy black stones planted in the sand to rest on. Some of them were huge and all festooned with white shells.
The children never tired of admiring these great rocks, smooth as blocks of cooled lava, and adorned with delicate embroidery of white pearls that described around them interlacing, festoons, chains, arabesques, sometimes bizarre designs, but always delightful.
This long afternoon walk gave the children a glimpse of their new domain, which the colonel limited to the point they reached.
Léopold will now have room to sulk," said Édouard, laughing.
- Oh, he won't be sulking by the sea," cried Amélie.
- He'll still sulk everywhere," said the colonel; "but there's been some progress in his manners. The verb "to want" is now conjugated only with Alfred.
- A little less so," said Amélie.
- I don't mind. However, your mother and I have given instructions never to leave him alone with Fédik on this isolated part of the shore. There's no telling where his wilful spirit might lead him. I have been warned that in these small, remote coves quicksand forms after high tides, which is quite dangerous for children. That's why I've restricted your walks to this point.
- However, Father," said Gustave, "there are also streams in these coves where there is sometimes a plentiful catch of small fish, as the customs officer told us when we asked for directions.
- So I don't mind if you and Sauerkraut go there in a group, I have no problem with that; but it would always be unwise to take your little brother, who has no idea of the danger he could be running. That sand, which only ever comes to a man's knees, would swallow him whole.
At that moment, two fishing boats appeared on the horizon, and the conversation changed subject.
When our strollers returned for dinner, they looked so good and had such good appetites that the mothers instantly forgot the embarrassments and inconveniences of the arrangement. Everyone enjoyed their dinner, except Leopold who thought everything was bad and, bending over his plate, smelt of the fish served to him, as he used to at his godmother's house.
Leopold, I will not tolerate this ugly habit," said the impatient colonel at last; "I would like all the dishes to stick to your nose.
- Here's one that sticks!" exclaimed Edouard, placing a dish containing a superb lobster under his chin.
- Isn't it cooked?" exclaimed Léopold, jumping to his feet in fright.
He laughed in response, and sheepishly sat down, glaring at Edward.
When supper was over, the walk was back on the agenda.
The children, naturally indefatigable, extolled the beauty of the moonlight over the sea. The two ladies refused to go out, claiming that they had to make some essential arrangements, especially the children's bedtime.
M. Dauvellec did his utmost, and although he would have preferred to spend the evening sitting quietly between his mother and his wife, he wandered along the shore in the company of an old fisherman from the village nicknamed Father La Plie, who agreed to hire out his boat for the nautical excursions that Édouard and Gustave were dreaming of.
Bedtime had come and gone, and the walkers didn't turn up. Not without difficulty, Mme Dauvellec pulled Léopold and Alfred away from making the paper boats. A whole flotilla, overturned by the slightest breeze, was already being arranged in good order on the pine table in the dining room, which had become the general meeting place.
Leopold still couldn't bring himself to willingly leave what was amusing him, and in his uncle's absence he tried to avoid the measure of time that alone keeps occupations in order.
He took a malicious pleasure in crumpling up all Fédik's boats by throwing them into the games box, and Fédik complained to his mother, gave her a threatening look, and, quite displeased, followed his aunt into what the colonel called the room.
This is your bed and Edouard's," said Madame Eugénie, gesturing to the large bed with a pillow and a cotton bonnet at each end.
- I want a bed all to myself," he replied.
He looked as if he'd had a bad day, stubborn, grumpy and untamable.
You see that's not possible," replied Madame Eugénie, "I'm only leaving you free to choose your companion.
- I don't want Edward.
- Well, Gustave it is.
- I don't want Gustave, he'd kick me.
- Take Fédik, then; with all the best will in the world, he won't get in your way.
- Oh yes, take me!" cried Alfred cuddling up to me; "you're my mate, Léopold, and you know that Mummy says I sleep like a little marmot.
- I don't want you.
- When you're alone, you're scared; when you're offered companionship, you don't want any. If you don't correct your bad temper, we won't be able to keep you in Darville. Scenes here would not be possible. So be reasonable. I know that Alfred won't get in your way in any way; I choose him as your companion. Kneel down and say your prayers.
Once the prayer was said, the bedtime was silent. Alfred was delighted with his sullen companion, to whom all his charming little faces did not wring a smile.
Léopold, on his pillow, had the most unpleasant face imaginable.
You haven't put on your bonnet," said Madame Eugénie; "the nights are very cool and the windows are not closed properly, so you must cover your head.
Léopold pushed his bonnet up to his eyebrows.
Oh," said Fédik sentimentally, "what a pretty cotton bonnet! Mummy, you promised you'd give me one in Darville.
- Your bonnet with laces is much more practical, my darling.
- Yes, but Léopold says I look like a little girl, and I'm a man.
- Well, I'm going to keep my promise," smiled Madame Eugénie, and taking one of the bonnets placed on the other bed, she put it on Alfred, whose look, at once glorious and serious, was most amusing.
"And now let's all go to sleep," said Madame Eugénie, placing a final kiss on the children's foreheads.
Then, deliberately leaving the door ajar, she went into the dining room where Madame Dauvellec was knitting stockings for Fédik.
Laughing, she told him about the bedtime scene and, taking her own basket of work, began the gentle vigil of the mother who, reassured about the fate of her loved ones, rests by looking after them.
But the silence of the room was soon interrupted by Fédik's plaintive voice, and the following dialogue took place between the bedroom and the dining room:
Mama," he said, "Leopold is giving me terrible eyes.
- Close your eyes, my darling, you won't see them.
- Mummy, he calls me a little polecat.
- Go to sleep, Fédik, you won't hear him.
Silence.
"Mummy, he says I look like an old grunt.
- It's not an insult, my Fédik.
- Mummy, he pulls all the wool over my eyes, Mummy... Mummy... Mummy..."
And little muffled sobs underlined the sentence.
Madame Eugénie got up and went into the room. Léopold, his head buried in his pillow, had his eyes closed; poor Fédik, stripped of his blanket, was trying to pull up his cotton bonnet, which his mischievous neighbour had pushed up to his chin.
Madame Eugénie turned away and called:
"Sauerkraut!"
The old soldier came running and gave a tremendous grunt when he saw Alfred shivering, his face red and bathed in tears.
Choucroute, you're going to stay here," said Madame Eugénie sternly, "and if Léopold does anything naughty again you'll warn the colonel, who can't be long in coming back.
- Yes, madame," replied Sauerkraut, threatening Leopold with his fist; "I'll take care of that with great pleasure.
Fédik was stroked, combed and wrapped up, and Madame Eugénie left the room again.
Choucroute, spotting a club in a corner of the flat, pounced on it and, coming to stand in front of Léopold, made a terrible reel over his head. Then, seeing the child close his eyes in fright, he placed the club on his shoulder like a rifle and began to walk with regular, slow, sentinel-like steps along the side of the large bed. At the slightest movement from Léopold, he grabbed the stick and all movement stopped immediately. He didn't have to watch for long. A few minutes of his rhythmic footsteps on the sounding floor were enough to put Fédik and his persecutor into a deep sleep.
X -- At sea
"Hey! hey! gentlemen, the wind has changed, the breeze is good, hey! hey!
The old fisherman, Father La Plie, placing his two calloused hands in front of his wide mouth, made this call under the narrow windows of the Ancre d'Argent.
Immediately they opened, and two white canvas caps adorned with their floating bibs came into view. They were Édouard and Gustave, scorched by the sun and wind, but their faces radiant with health and joy.
Are you boarding, Father La Plie?" they shouted.
- In half an hour; the water is rising.
- All right, wait for us.
Édouard and Gustave rushed into the dining room.
"Good mother, please have breakfast ready quickly, we're going fishing.
- Has your mother given her permission, children?
-- We're going to ask her for our exeat. Where is she, please?
- In church, I think. Go and find her; in the meantime, Sauerkraut will prepare your lunch.
- I'm going to God's house too, to fetch Mummy," cried a little voice.
And Fédik leapt into the dining room.
And you, Léopold, are you coming?" asked Édouard, stepping towards the bedroom door.
- No, I'm bored," replied Léopold, who always preferred his little selfish pleasures to general outings.
Édouard and Gustave didn't insist; they put his little straw hat on Fédik's head and led him at a brisk pace towards the old church, nestled in a veritable nest of greenery. The laughing enclosure of the dead that preceded it formed a harmonious contrast with the aridity of the neighbouring shores. The lungs, irritated by the harsh breeze blowing in from the English Channel, felt a delicious sensation as they breathed the softer air, and their eyes rested with delight on the green grass growing thickly over the rustic tombs.
The young boys entered, signing and kneeling for a moment on the flagstones, while Fédik ran towards his mother and sister kneeling in a bench. The entrance of her sons had announced to Mme Eugénie in advance that her presence was necessary.
As the colonel had been recalled to Coutances, she alone bore the very heavy burden of absolute and responsible authority; so she hardly felt at home during this temporary regency.
She finished her prayer and left the church with the children. Edward, who had offered her his arm, informed her of their plans.
The weather seems uncertain," she said; "let's go as far as the pier.
They walked to the little cove where the fishing boats were sheltered. Father La Plie, sitting in his, was untangling his nets.
Sailor," shouted Édouard in his vibrant voice, "please come and talk to my mother.
The old fisherman threw down his net, grabbed a boat hook, pulled his boat closer to the neighbouring boats and, jumping from one side to the other, reached the end of the pier.
What's in it for you, madam?" he asked, pushing his chewing tobacco into his left cheek.
- My sons have asked to accompany you.
Don't you think the weather is very gloomy and the wind very strong?
- Clear weather is not the best for fishing, madam; we prefer weather that's a bit cloudy. As for the wind, it's good, and if it makes the boat dance a bit, it won't be any more dangerous for that. It's good weather in the Channel, it's very good weather.
Mme Dauvellec looked at her sons, who were watching her face with concern.
If it's reasonable," she said, "do it.
- I assure you, my mother," said Edouard gravely, "that if there were the slightest danger we would not embark. A bit of bad weather at sea doesn't frighten us, it pleases us. However, the fear of worrying you makes us, I assure you, very cautious. Amélie, are you coming?
Amélie nodded her brown head in the negative.
I'm only going on board with Dad, you know that," she said.
- Let's go for lunch!" exclaimed Gustave; "the sea won't wait for us.
They returned to the house and began the lunch prepared by Choucroute. Naturally, as they ate their lunch, Édouard and Gustave told their grandmother about their recent exploits at sea. There is always some forgotten detail in a first account, and besides, Granny was very forgiving of repetition.
"Young and old always ramble a bit", she used to say with her charming smile.
Léopold, who was having lunch with his cousins, was all ears and seemed preoccupied.
In the usual company of his uncle, who was as brave as his sword, and these two bold boys who were never frightened by any danger, he was beginning to get over his shameful cowardice. He dared to fall asleep in the dark, to load a revolver, to forget a trivial graze. But nautical expeditions had always caused him a secret dread, and while passionately desiring this unrivalled pleasure, he had suffered, without shouting, the measure taken by the colonel never to let him embark.
At sea," said Mr Dauvellec, "it is not good to have undisciplined or timid passengers: Léopold will only go on a boat when he is either more intrepid or more obedient.
He was not yet obedient; he submitted to force, but not to reason. Fearless, he was becoming more so; his human instincts were awakening and there was now a struggle between his usual cowardice and his desire to take part in the tiring but joyful sea games. That day he thought that in his uncle's absence he could try this seductive excursion, and, suddenly approaching Gustave, who did not intimidate him, he said:
"Ask Edouard to take me today. I want to go with you.
- Edouard's not the master, ask Mum," said Gustave.
And seeing that he didn't dare make his request:
Mama," he said, "Léopold wants to come with us.
- Your father would object," replied Madame Eugénie, "and I couldn't give him permission if he wasn't here.
- It's because I scream when the boat moves that my uncle has forbidden me to go on board," said Leopold briskly. Today, I won't shout.
- He is indeed less of a coward," said Gustave in a conciliatory tone.
- Much less so," affirmed Amélie who, through the natural kindness of her heart, protected Léopold in all encounters.
- What do you think, Mother?" asked Madame Eugénie.
- I think that this pleasure was only denied to Leopold because he was very timid. Now, if he wants to, I don't see any reason why he shouldn't go with Edouard and Gustave.
- Bonne-maman has decided," said Amélie, clapping her hands together.
Fédik alone looked dismayed: he was going to lose his playmate for a whole afternoon. Climbing onto the arm of Mme Dauvellec's armchair, he timidly asked her if he too could go on a boat trip. He was tall and unafraid, and Father La Plie called him his little midshipman. Mme Dauvellec gave him her reasons for not agreeing to what he was asking, and after five minutes of this intimate conversation, he went downstairs with a sigh of resignation. He went so far as to lead his brothers. Clinging to Amélie's tunic, he couldn't resist telling her again that he would have liked to go on a boat, that he was tall, not afraid and that Father La Plie called him his little midshipman, but that Granny had told him that she would be sad not to have her little companion and that he didn't want to upset Granny.
While muttering his little reasons, he watched with interest the preparations for departure, in which Édouard and Gustave were actively involved. Soon the light boat was covered with sails, and Father La Plie seized the rudder and the boat moved off rapidly.
Léopold huddled cautiously against the mainmast and remained silent for about half an hour. He had a certain feeling, which was not exactly a pleasure, as he felt the shaking of the frail boat by the waves. Soon he felt reassured and even enjoyed walking around the boat. No one was paying any attention to him. Father La Plie was at the helm, Edouard only had eyes for the line attached to the back of the boat, Gustave sometimes replaced his brother and prepared the bait and hooks for him.
When they arrived at the fishing spot, the big net was spread out. The old fisherman looked at the moving surface with a gaze that seemed to penetrate its depths.
"Here", he said.
And the boat's speed slowed.
Léopold, who was having a great time, was running back and forth, laughing out loud, calling out to his cousins and flogging the water with a stick he had found.
Suddenly, the old fisherman ordered him to be quiet.
My little freshwater sailor, you scream like a seagull in a hurricane," he said; it's obvious you don't know your job. The fish can hear the noise you're making.
- Fish that can hear!" exclaimed Léopold, laughing; "they don't just have ears.
Father La Plie looked at him sideways: he could hardly hear a joke in the heat of his work.
"Silence on board!" he grumbled, and with a gesture that demanded attention, he dropped the net.
The part fitted with the pieces of lead known as ropes sank into the sea, while the other part remained in the hands of Édouard and Father La Plie. The boat spun slowly and the three-maille followed. It was raised several times.
A few sole, sea bass and mullet piled up on deck.
Father La Plie grumbled in his old beard, and more than once threw back into the sea the fish he didn't think were worth taking.
A dozen medium-sized fish was all the result of several hours of fatigue.
It wasn't brilliant, but a man accustomed to battling with the elements always acquires a dose of patience that the most transcendent philosophy is sometimes powerless to provide, and the old fisherman, once the catch was over, didn't give even a sign of annoyance.
"Meagre catch, meagre catch", he repeated twice.
And that was all.
Besides, the overcast sky and the rough sea forced him to carry out a series of manoeuvres that absorbed all his attention.
Édouard and Gustave, guessing that the weather was worrying him somewhat, had become as silent as he was and obeyed his commands without a word.
Léopold watched in amazement. Because Father La Plie entrusted the rudder to Édouard when the boat strayed from the shore, he had always imagined that his cousins commanded and steered it as they pleased. And now they would not move a rope without the good man's permission, and they consulted him gravely about the slightest movement. The little idiot was very amused to see all this; he laughed ironically and jumped up and down, ignoring Father La Plie's observations. As he obeyed no one, there was no danger of him obeying an old sailor all tarred up and walking barefoot.
Careful! The boat is listing enough," shouted Father La Plie suddenly; "bring everything up. Now," he continued, "the jib sheet has to be hauled in.
He grabbed the sheet, but felt resistance and turned abruptly away. Leopold had tangled his legs in the rope and was laughing as he tried to disentangle himself.
Sir, do you want the sail to cut your face in two?" shouted the sailor. Here, you lot, I'll clear the sheet.
He grabbed Léopold under the arms, and despite his cries, pulled him out from among the coils of rope.
My boot, my boot!" cried Leopold; "I've lost my boot.
- Your boot? Ah, the shoe; it will turn up. Mr Edouard, pull up on the sheet.
- But I'm barefoot; you can see you've torn off my boot.
- You shouldn't have put it in my ropes; aft! You're getting in the way of the manoeuvre.
- I don't mind; are you the master here?
Father La Plie placed his suroë askew, and frowning terribly at his greying eyebrows, stamping his foot on the floor of the boat:
The master!" he repeated in a thunderous voice; "you must know, my boy, that it is I, Pierre Carville, who, as my late captain used to say, am master, after God, of this boat, and not someone else. Back off, little scamp, or I'll have you bathed in sea water before the freshwater bath that awaits you.
Father La Plie's face and gesture were nothing if not reassuring. Léopold hastened to flee from the hairy, calloused hand that was reaching out towards him, and hobbled away.
Soon, something whistling through the air fell near him. It was his boot that Gustave had sent back to him. He put his shoes back on, muttering to himself, then stood up again, frightened. A broad gleam had crossed the black sky, and an airy roll followed it.
Oh, my God, thunder!" he cried; "but I'm afraid of thunder! I don't want to hear it!
- Plug your ears," shouted Edouard.
He did not fail to do so, and with his fingers pressed into his ears, he began to run to and fro, looking for a covered shelter but finding none. To make matters worse, the rain began, a bright, drizzling rain against which there was no shelter. The old fisherman, Edouard and Gustave received it stoically and did not leave the manoeuvre, which continued to be difficult, for a moment. Poor Léopold's tears and sobs amused them at first.
I'm all wet," he cried, "the rain is getting into my sleeves; it's getting into my neck.
As he cried real tears, their good hearts got the better of them. They piled on some clothes they could spare.
Father La Plie went so far as to put his suroë over his head, under which he made the most pitiful figure in the world. Finally, they rolled him up in a piece of old sail and tied him to the mast to keep him quiet.
Finally, sometimes trying to stretch the sail, sometimes advancing by dint of their oars, they reached Darville and disembarked under the rays of the doubly brilliant sun that follows the short summer storms. Mme Dauvellec herself had come forward to meet them at the landing point. They were awaited with a mixture of impatience and concern. Édouard and Gustave, soaked to the skin, were as red as apples, and their eyes were as bright as ever.
The movement they had given themselves had prevented any cooling. They appeared dragging poor Leopold, still hooded in the suroë and half wrapped in the sail, which was dripping water. He was cold, mortified and half-dead; he was immediately laid in a warm bed.
By order of Madame Eugénie, Édouard and Gustave followed suit, but they ate the supper served to them by Choucroute like ogres and had the happiest night in the world under their cotton bonnets. They had called loudly for Mummy and asked for someone to come and work in their room.
"I feel like I'm in the ogre's castle with all Thumbelina's brothers," said Amélie, laughing out loud as she watched Fédik give his little bonnet the same flirtatious look as Édouard's had.
Léopold, warmed and restored, ended up taking part in the general merriment; but he declared that he would never again set foot in Father La Plie's boat.
XI -- Disobedience
The harsh lesson which Léopold had received during the boat trip produced a certain improvement in his character. He became less demanding and more docile with Choucroute, whom he took great pleasure in resisting.
One day he even answered his first call, which had never happened before.
He had a very keen ear for his uncle, aunt and even his older cousins, who could only take a joke up to a point; but any other call made him deaf. One of the most disobliging habits of spoilt children is that of giving in only to repeated injunctions. They don't know how to give up anything that amuses them and put their whim of the moment before anything else. The day when Léopold heard Choucroute calling him to put on his hat and immediately replied: "I'll go and get it", Mme Dauvellec, who was knitting under the little shelter tent where she spent her afternoons, looked at her daughter-in-law sitting next to her and said:
"Decidedly, our spoilt child is correcting herself".
Mme Eugénie shook her head in the negative, which seemed to scandalise the good grandmother.
"Eugenie, I don't recognise your usual impartiality; it seems to me that little Léopold is becoming another child.
She held out her large ivory needle.
"Look at him looking for shells with Amélie; isn't he just the sweetest?
About fifty metres away, in the middle of the beach, Amélie and Léopold were walking bent over, obviously looking for shells. The little girl, tired, dropped onto a mound and began to make the pearly shells cascade down her dress with her hand. Léopold complacently continued his search and came back to her again and again, handing over his booty with an air of kindness and eagerness.
Mme Eugénie looked with a smile at the group her mother-in-law was pointing out.
"Amélie is beginning to take a certain hold over him, and his little selfish nature is feeling a little shaken; but the bottom has not been seriously dented. Most of the time he submits only by force. I watch him closely every day. Every time he thinks he's safe from the surveillance he fears, he commits the forbidden act, and not only without hesitation, but with the evil joy of a being taking revenge.
- I know that you have very good eyes, Eugénie, and that I wear glasses, but I'm sticking to my hope that this poor child will get better.
- I share it, my mother, but I can't help feeling a certain mistrust: his will has not been softened, and if he leaves our hands with the ulterior motive of hating the authority that hinders him and deceiving it as much as possible, school life will not be good for him and he will never fully correct himself. That is why I am doubly delighted that my husband is back. His presence will perhaps put an absolute stop to all Leopold's devious little independences, and, if he really does get out of the habit, he's saved.
- I assure you, Eugénie, that he hardly ever disobeys now; but, I repeat, your eyes are younger and more penetrating than mine.
- Clear-sightedness is the virtue par excellence for a mother; I am responsible for souls, I have to safeguard Amélie and Alfred from pernicious examples; Alfred especially, who loves Léopold very much and is still only an imitation.
- He comes running in with his brothers; they seem to have some news. My son may have arrived.
- Oh no, he wrote me formally that he wouldn't be free until the end of the week," said Mme Eugénie, turning to Édouard and Gustave who, in order to get there more quickly, were dragging Alfred along, lifting him so high that the tips of his little feet only grazed the sand.
They were indeed bringing news. A valet from Valognes, who had been detained in Darville until the following day, had offered to hire his car for an excursion in the surrounding area. It was a unique opportunity that had to be seized.
Everything comes to those who wait," said Mme Eugénie, smiling; "I certainly won't refuse you this pleasure. Will you come with us, Mother?
- No, oh no," replied the grandmother, shaking her head gently; "in this heat, any inconvenience would be unbearable for me.
- The carriage is small, by the way," said Edouard, "and Granny wouldn't be comfortable in it.
- Let's go and have a look," said Mme Eugénie. Gustave, call Léopold and Amélie; come along, my little Alfred.
She took Alfred by the hand and walked up the beach, followed by Édouard, who was supporting his grandmother's slightly unsteady step, and Gustave who, after calling the shellfish collectors, had taken charge of the folders.
The car was in front of the door of the Silver Anchor stable. It was a rather poorly built American, in which only five seats could be found.
Léopold could well come between us, Mother!" cried Amélie, who had noticed the sullen look her cousin had taken on when he saw himself excluded from the ride.
- My horse is tired, and there are ribs," said the valet briskly; "I can only accept four people.
- Leopold and Fédik will stay and keep me company," said the grandmother kindly.
- Will you take care of that, Mother?" asked Madame Eugénie.
- I will.
- They won't leave you?
- Of course not, Sauerkraut will bring the tent down to the shore and they can play there at their leisure. Won't they, my children?
- Oh, Mummy, I'm so happy to be staying with you on my own!" cried Fédik, taking his grandmother's wrinkled hand in his little hands, "and Leopold too.
Leopold remained silent. It was part of the selfish habits of a spoilt child to want to go everywhere, and he was often hurt to see himself treated with so little ceremony. In large families, it is always the case that, by the very force of circumstances, people are obliged to separate.
Until then, as a newcomer, he had had a sort of precedence over his cousins; but Mme Eugénie, recognising that these good offices aroused neither her delicacy nor her gratitude, had resolved to abandon him to the hazards of his age.
No one took any notice of her bad temper, and lunch was eaten cheerfully and somewhat hastily.
The beautiful land of Blanchevoile, which they had chosen as the destination for their excursion, was several leagues away, and the coachman predicted that even if they set off early, they would not return until nightfall.
While the American car was being hitched up, Édouard and Gustave helped Choucroute to carry the bench topped by a tent, which was Mme Dauvellec's usual seat, some distance from the inn.
Mother, will you promise not to leave the children?" said Mme Eugénie as they got into the carriage.
- My daughter, don't worry, I won't lose sight of them; don't worry at all," replied the good grandmother, who was holding Alfred in one hand and had the other placed on Léopold's shoulder. I'll spend my afternoon on the shore where they always have fun; they won't leave me a foot.
With that assurance, they set off, and Mme Dauvellec, motioning to Choucroute to open the large parasol he had placed on her shoulder, headed for her little shelter. Léopold and Alfred went ahead of her, pushing a wheelbarrow with wooden spades and rakes that they used to pile the sand into mounds, scatter it or stir it up to look for shells.
Should we stay with madame?" asked Choucroute, when Mme Dauvellec was seated; "watching the children might be quite tiring!
- Not at all, not at all; from here I can see the whole shore. Go and help your wife, my good Choucroute; this sudden departure has turned everything upside down in the rooms, so you're perfectly free until snack time.
Choucroute never had an order repeated to him: he immediately turned on his heels and went back to the inn. Mme Dauvellec looked around for her little companions. They had set themselves up against a large isolated rock and were ploughing the sand as best they could. Satisfied to see them so busy with their game, she placed her work basket on her lap and took out a knitted fabric, a pretty little stocking striped in blue and white.
She didn't work for long. The warm, heavy atmosphere was conducive to sleep, and the breeze and the waves sang in her ears a sort of monotonous, enchanting lullaby, which soon had an effect.
When Alfred, suddenly abandoning his game at Leopold's behest, ran to his grandmother to ask her for something to put on a necklace of shiny shells, he found her fast asleep.
He looked at her in silence for a while, then picked up the ball of shells that had rolled onto the sand and stood up on tiptoe.
"I'd like to wake you up, Grandma," he said quietly.
Grandma was sleeping like a log.
"What will I do to wake her up?" thought Fédik.
Then, noticing that Madame Dauvellec had slipped one of her fine steel needles into her thick white hair, he tore a second one from the knitting and methodically placed it opposite the other. The double jerk produced no result, but the needles had such a pretty effect that the other three passed cotton stitches through the silver papillotes.
He operated with such care that Mme Dauvellec was in no way perturbed.
He smiled when he saw the pretty halo he had made on his grandmother's dear face; then he said, still very low:
"Grandma, don't you want to wake up?
And his words being ineffectual, he gambolled back to Léopold.
"Give me the thread quickly, all the shells have holes in them.
- I don't have any thread," replied Alfred, "Grandma is asleep.
Léopold, who was sorting shells, looked up sharply.
She's just pretending," he said.
- Oh no, she's really asleep.
Léopold stood up.
"Is Sauerkraut here?
- No, there's nobody here.
At this word, a singular expression, the bad expression of the old days, painted itself on Leopold's darkened face.
He cast around him that furtive glance which announces the passage of a disloyal thought over the soul, and, having signalled Alfred to wait for him, he walked slowly towards the bench where Mme Dauvellec was sleeping the sleep of the just, as peaceful as it was deep.
The vigilant and respected guardian had no eyes to see, there was really no one there, and the evil spirit breathed into the child I don't know what unhealthy joy.
He returned to Alfred and, with a kick, scattered the shells he had painstakingly piled up:
Here," he said.
- Oh, Leopold," cried Alfred, startled.
- Oh, what? Is it fun making piles of shells? I'm bored with that! I know where I'd like to go.
- Where would you like to go?
- To the large cove to fish for plaice; that's what's fun!
- It's forbidden, you know.
- Yes, before and after the tide, because then you sink into the sand; but it's very dry now. Would you like to come along, Alfred? You'll see how much fun it is.
- If Granny lets me, I'll go.
- As she's asleep, we can't ask her permission. On the way, we'll go into Father La Plie's house, he'll lend us his little pipe and we'll have a smoke.
- But that's forbidden!" shouted Alfred, whose little head was beginning to wobble at this succession of plans.
- It's forbidden for you, not for me; Edouard smokes cigarettes, you know that.
- He's tall.
- Not much taller than me. At Châtel, I saw a little boy your age smoking.
- My own age, Leopold?
- Yes; it's so much fun to smoke! Your head spins, it's as if you were dreaming. Are you coming? Aren't you coming? I'm leaving.
Leopold walked with long strides towards the small pavement.
"Léopold... good-mother!" cried a distraught Alfred.
And, not knowing where to go, he ran towards the bench, then, retracing his steps, returned to Léopold. Léopold walked quickly, as if to flee from him, then suddenly stopped as if to wait for him: the true strategy of temptation. If he had run very hard, Alfred would have gone back to his granny; if he had waited, Alfred would have resumed his observations. By moving far enough away so as not to hear her and yet remaining within range of her gaze, he was bound to draw her to follow him. And so he did. After two or three desperate zigzags, Alfred ran straight towards Léopold and caught up with him near a hut built at the end of the road.
Sit there," said Leopold, "do as I do, pull up your socks and sneakers and shove them under that big stone. We'll walk much better barefoot on the shore.
Alfred didn't hesitate. Walking barefoot was an extreme pleasure for him.
While he was taking off his shoes with great difficulty, Léopold climbed a few steps formed by huge pebbles joined together by a coarse cement and, with his friendliest air, wished Father La Plie good morning as he sat on the ground mending a net.
The man smiled back at the child's greeting and said:
"These gentlemen would no doubt like to take a trip out to sea?
- My cousins are going for a drive today.
- Ah well! then it's not a question of getting on board, because as far as you're concerned, my little sir, you're just a freshwater sailor.
- Are you never afraid at sea, Father La Plie?
- Never, by the grace of God.
- Is it the fish that make such big holes in your net?
- They do. Ah! they defend their lives well. Last night I found three hooks that had been eaten.
- Do they eat the hooks?
- They cut the string that attaches them with their teeth and swallow them at home. Some of these big conger eels have the strength of a horse.
- Ah! the ugly beasts! Say, Father La Plie, did my cousin Edouard leave his overcoat in your boat yesterday?
- Yes, he did. Would you bring it to him? It's hanging on a gaff.
Leopold walked towards the cabin, saw the garment, quickly slipped his hand into one of the pockets and quickly withdrew two objects which he made disappear into his own; then returning to the courtyard:
It's too heavy," he said hypocritically, "it would be in the way when I ran; I'll take it back as I pass.
And, descending the steps quickly, he went to find Alfred who was slipping his espadrilles with effort under the stone indicated.
Father La Plie, we put our socks and shoes here, under a stone," shouted Léopold.
- That's all right," replied Father La Plie in his stormy voice; "you'll find them where you put them.
- Is Father La Plie here?" said Alfred; "I'll go and say hello to him.
- Come and fish," said Léopold, dragging him along.
They turned off the cliff and headed out onto the immense shore, which they had been forbidden to enter, firstly because it was so far from any habitation, and then because of the coves filled with sand that was reputed to be dangerous, especially for children, because at certain times of the day it became shifty.
This danger remained a problem for Léopold. In his ignorance, he had only seen this defence as a limit to his freedom.
Father La Plie, Choucroute, Édouard and Gustave had often gone fishing in these terrible coves; once or twice he had ventured there himself and had only felt the sand softer than anywhere else. Now, it was at the bottom of these coves that there were lovely streams of clear water in which prawns hopped about, and it was in this damp sand that very delicate little plaice were caught, simply by striking the damp surface with the flat of the hand.
Shortly before reaching the beach, the children stopped in the shade of a large rock, whose shadow cooled them. Alfred was tired, but his pockets were bulging with charming shells he had picked up while walking, and he found his walk extraordinarily intoxicating.
I've got some cigarettes," said Leopold, pulling a small paper-wrapped packet from his pocket. If you tell my aunt that I've been smoking, I'll never take you with me again.
Alfred didn't reply. Léopold, at this moment, was taking on very great proportions in his eyes, and moreover he felt under his sole protection.
Stunned with admiration, he watched him strike the lighter and light a cigarette.
To me!" he cried, "to me too!
- No, you'd be sick.
- No, no, I sometimes take a puff from Sauerkraut's pipe. Please, Leopold, give me a cigarette.
- I haven't got any, I've only got one.
- Food then, food, nothing but food.
- Food, here you go."
And the cigarette passed between Alfred's pink lips, intoxicating him with admiration for Leopold and making him lose all notion of the serious disobedience he was committing.
Anyone who had seen the wise little Fédik with a cigarette in his mouth would have thought he was dreaming. With Colonel Dauvellec, no unhealthy habit was possible. Édouard would not have smoked a cigarette more than the number allowed by his father on feast days; the danger of being dumbed down by tobacco was thus eliminated. But at this moment Léopold was rediscovering all his evil instincts in his spoiled conscience, and he was abusing his little cousin's credulity without remorse.
However, selfish above all else, he soon rudely told Alfred that his food was wearing out the cigarette, and that he wouldn't have it any more. To his surprise, Alfred did not protest.
It's getting on your nerves," said the naughty boy.
- No," replied Fédik, who looked very pale, "I've... I've... I've...
- What? Tell me, what's wrong?
- I'm sick to my stomach.
A burst of laughter from Léopold answered him.
"If you're ill, go away," he said.
Alfred looked out over the vastness that surrounded them.
I'd be scared on my own," he stammered.
- Well, let's go fishing, run a little, it will pass.
They started to run, and the movement made poor Alfred feel a little better.
Oh, we'll find lots of little fish," exclaimed Léopold; "the sand is all dark: Father La Plie never looks for them unless they're that colour.
In the very large cove, which was rounded off against a rocky cliff, the sand was indeed of a much darker shade, and formed a long, russet trail which probably reached the water. The trickle of water gushing out of the rocks, swollen by the slightest rainstorm, kept the place cool. The stream emerged from the cliffs, slipped under a rocky bed, then disappeared into the sand, giving it the dark hue that delighted Léopold's eyes at the moment.
The two children went back up to the source of the little stream and began their fishing.
They went after transparent prawns and small silver fish frolicking in the trickle.
Alfred found it so pleasant to walk in the water that he hardly ever left the stream bed.
Léopold, on the other hand, preferred to bang on the sand where they sank a little, hoping to see plaice appear, but finding only shellfish, which were very good indeed, and which he feasted on immediately.
They gradually made their way along the shore, Alfred up to his ankles in water and Léopold pulling his feet, one after the other, out of the wet sand.
"The other day, I wasn't sinking like that.
- Oh, I've got one!" cried Fédik as he stood up, his little fist clenched to hold back a shrimp that he had trapped.
And, looking ahead, he added, responding to Léopold's observation:
"Maybe it's the sea doing that.
- The sea," laughed Leopold; "where is it, the sea?
- It's coming in. Look, they look like sheep.
Leopold, who was talking with his eyes on the sand, suddenly raised his head.
Yes, it's coming," he said; "I thought it wasn't coming at this time of day. We're a long way off, you know. Well, where are you running to?
- Come on, Leopold: we'll catch it before it gets into the sea.
- Leave it alone!" shouted Leopold; "come back!
But Alfred was off and running after the shrimp in the small stream, which was getting wider and shallower.
Suddenly there was a piercing cry.
"Oh, how I'm sinking! how I'm sinking!" cried Alfred.
He had touched the wetland with his foot and couldn't pull his feet out.
"I told him not to go that far!" cried Léopold, rushing forward.
But he was heavier than Alfred and he felt himself sinking.
"Léopold! Leopold!" shouted Fédik, waving his arms, "come and get me out of here; I'm sinking, I'm sinking!
Leopold, sensing the dreadful danger into which he had dragged his cousin, clearly understanding that he could only advance towards him by engulfing himself, felt a cold sweat bead his hair.
Wait," he shouted, "wait, don't move, I'll go and get Sauerkraut.
And, scrambling out of the sand, not thinking that he had nearly two kilometres to go and that any help might come too late, he set off towards the village, pursued by Alfred's piercing cries and sobs.
And Granny was still asleep, and the breeze did not bring her the heart-rending lament of her beloved child, threatened with a death as awful as it was unexpected.
XII -- On the road
How they moaned, the poor horses harnessed to the carriage that runs, at will, between Valognes and Darville! It is market day in the Norman town and the postilion, no longer having to fear the surveillance of the octroi, welcomes on the road many travellers and parcels. They are everywhere. The seat was overcrowded, the old tarpaulin was swollen to bursting point and the interior was a veritable heap. The postillion and those who had usurped his seat lightened the car with their weight.
A loud voice, a commanding voice, was heard from inside.
"Driver, please open the door; I'd really like to do what you're doing.
It was Colonel Dauvellec speaking and the door opened immediately. He jumped out of the powdery box, and all the men in the car followed suit, leaving only a few women in the car who were finally able to sit down a little comfortably.
The colonel shook himself and said with a smile to his companion, a man dressed like a well-to-do farmer:
"I'll be damned if I'm going to set foot in that awful box again! I think we're very close to Darville?
- We've only got a little way to go, sir, and if you take the path along the shore you'll cut a kilometre off the journey.
- If I didn't fear getting lost, I'd take this path straight away; the car, crowded as it is, seems unbearable.
- Colonel, I can drive you, as I have to stop in Darville. This will give me the opportunity to show you the piece of land I spoke to you about, where a pretty little house like the one you seem to want could be built.
- Come on," said M. Dauvellec, "a walk will do me good, and I don't care if the carriage arrives before I do, as my family have not been informed of my return.
And, making a negative sign to the postillion who was showing him the carriage with his hand, he followed his driver along a path through the fields.
They reached the narrow path that ran along the cliffs.
Let's continue along the field path," said the farmer cautiously; "on the cliff path, you should always look at your feet.
They walked in silence for some time. Mr Dauvellec was enjoying the breeze, which seemed to freshen as the sea advanced over the vast beaches. Suddenly he stopped.
Isn't that a cry of distress I've just heard," he said, "a child's cry?
- Children don't usually come this far," replied the farmer.
And, stretching out his arm, he added:
"This is the land, sir, here, in front of you, this field where you see three plum trees and which is surrounded by a very high embankment. The wheat grows well here, as you can see.
- So much the better, because in the country it's good to have a garden, or at least a vegetable patch.
- Here, you'd have famous vegetables. Don't get ahead of yourself, sir. I assure you that the path through the fields is safer than the one along the cliff, which in many places has collapsed.
Mr Dauvellec was no longer listening to him; he had crossed a low stone wall and taken the path marked out on the crest of the cliffs.
I knew it!" he cried; "there's a child half buried in the sand. Where can we go to rescue him? Where is the path that... God! my son!
He stopped looking for the path and took a gymnastic stride down the steep, jagged slope of the cliff.
In a few leaps he was on the shore, and walking through the sand, which soon sank up to his knees, he reached the child, who was still weakly waving his arms above the sand that reached up to his chest, but whose face was tilted back, pale and decomposed.
He plucked him effortlessly from the damp abyss and let his breath pass through his mouth, still half-open from a last cry.
Alfred took a long breath.
The father looked up at the sky, his eyes suddenly brimming with tears.
Sir, do we have to go to your aid?" shouted the farmer, who ran over.
- It's useless," replied M. Dauvellec. Thank God I arrived in time. Another five minutes and he'd have suffocated.
He struggled back to the shore, carrying Alfred in his arms, still unconscious but breathing faster.
A few lotions of fresh water, drawn from the spring that had nearly proved so fatal, soon revived him. He opened his eyes and smiled at his father.
"And the prawn?" he said in a hoarse voice.
Then, suddenly, his face lit up with fear, his teeth began to chatter, and he pressed both hands to his chest:
The sand, Daddy, the ugly sand," he cried, crying.
- There's none left, there's none left," replied Mr Dauvellec gently, "but my little Fédik is wet up to his ears. Let's go home, quickly, very quickly!
He got up and set off towards the village, carrying Alfred whose pale head was resting on his shoulder.
Halfway along, they met Choucroute coming at a gallop. Further on, they found Madame Dauvellec shuffling along, one hand on her cane and the other on her parasol. Finally, at the entrance to the village, they saw Léopold, exhausted and ashamed.
M. Dauvellec had reassured his mother with a word, but when he saw Léopold, who was retreating as far as possible from Father La Plie's hut, he remembered what Choucroute had just told him about his ward's guilt.
When Madame Eugénie and her children arrived on the evening of their expedition, they found Alfred in bed, shivering with fever, but on the whole quite well recovered from his terrible accident. That evening, there was no scolding, no recriminations, no punishments. All these good hearts felt at first only a feeling of thanksgiving towards Providence which had spared them from inconsolable grief.
XIII -- The punishment
The days that followed this moving day were full of anxiety. The shock had been very strong for poor little Alfred and, on the orders of the doctor who had been sent for from Valognes, he was kept in bed and subjected to a strict diet. His brothers and sister never left his side, and when the prostration that was his usual state gave way a little, they all came to gently distract him by sharing his games.
Amélie laid out cannons, Édouard carved out fortresses, Gustave rigged fleets.
As for Léopold, to whom no one paid any attention, he remained huddled in a corner, not daring to come too close to his uncle, whose stern gaze weighed terribly on him. He was beginning to understand that disobedience is a source of sorrow; he was finally suffering from himself. Everyone treated him coldly, except his little victim, who smiled at him from afar and had a thousand kind words said to him by Amélie, whose heart was so compassionate.
Alfred's indisposition lasted four days, and then all alarming symptoms disappeared. A night of deep sleep brought about a complete transition from sickness to full health, and one fine morning the child appeared again on the shore in the sleigh devised to take Mrs Dauvellec.
Choucroute pulled him along easily, Édouard and Gustave pushed at the back and Amélie held an open parasol over his head. Léopold had seen them off and had not dared to follow. For four days, he had been playing alone in a sort of abandoned sentry box. Like a little owl, he was fleeing the glare of the day.
The grandparents had stayed in the dining room, where, Edouard said, they seemed to be holding a meeting.
Alfred came back from his walk all rosy and lively, and the lunch, which he attended for form's sake, was very cheerful.
At dessert, they drank to his health and the children were preparing to disappear, as was their custom, when the colonel gave them a sign that nailed them to their seats.
Léopold, who had risen as they had, looked fearfully at his uncle.
Sit down," said the latter gravely; "it's about you.
Leopold, who had always expected to be punished, thought that the time had come to pay his debt. He obeyed, blushing.
I shall not waste my time reminding you of the kindnesses we have done you," said the colonel in his strong voice. I have treated you like a son; for your own good, I have tried to soften your still rebellious will: you have resisted, you will resist, and as I do not want this reasoned, permanent indiscipline in my house, I am giving you back to your godmother until the end of the holidays. You'll leave tomorrow, and in a month's time I'll have you sent to the college of my choice. You don't have a great fortune; I wanted to place you with my son at the Collège de la Flèche, because after all it's generous blood that runs in your veins; but I want people, even at your age, to know how to wear a military uniform with dignity, and you're absolutely incapable of doing that."
Léopold had gone from being very red to very pale; his tear-filled eyes looked up at the colonel with such a heart-rending expression that Amélie cried out:
"Father, please...
- Not a word," said M. Dauvellec sternly: "His departure is decided, he will leave. Sauerkraut, my coffee!
The decision had been made; when the colonel spoke in that tone of voice, his wife herself gave the example of absolute submission. We rose from the table and parted. Amélie, who had been detained for some time by her grandmother, who only left the table on her son's arm, set off in search of Léopold as soon as she was free. She had seen a painful twinge pass over his face, which was usually so indifferent; her good heart had been moved.
Contrary to her expectations, she did not find him with Alfred; she ran to Father La Plie, towards whose hut Edouard and Gustave had gone: he was not with them.
Worried, she wandered along the shore, calling out to him but receiving no reply.
In the middle of her wanderings, she came across her father walking side by side with the farmer who had made the last trip to Valognes with him.
Who are you looking for with that worried look on your face?" he asked the child.
- Leopold, Dad; I can't find him anywhere.
- Don't worry, he's not lost. If you look hard enough, you'll find him quietly playing the game he's enjoying at the moment. Don't worry, Amélie, Léopold is delighted to be leaving us. He's a spoilt heart, and that's why I'm leaving him.
He walked away, and Amélie, impressed by these words, took one last look around her. She saw two soles sticking out of the old guardhouse, not the large-nailed soles of the customs officer on guard, but two thin soles that she thought belonged to Léopold.
She ran over and found him huddled in his hiding place, sobbing, his head buried in his hands.
This time, the test had penetrated beyond the layer of selfishness in which the child's heart had, until then, rolled with delight.
At the moment of parting, probably for ever, from this kind family, where he had been received like a son, he felt bitter regret.
Where would he find a mother like Mme Dauvellec, a sister like Amélie, a little brother like Alfred? The anguish he had experienced as a result of his disobedience had begun to shake his selfish and indifferent ego; Mr Dauvellec's ruling had thrown him decidedly to the ground.
Amélie, touched by this outburst of sensitivity for which Léopold's character had not prepared her, crept close to him on the little bench and began to console him as best she could. Her father's words came back to her memory; she told herself that if the colonel saw Leopold at this moment he would perhaps allow himself to be moved. She would have liked to drag Leopold before him in tears, but the child did not seem disposed to let himself be torn from his guardhouse, and on the other hand the colonel had spoken with too much authority for it to be possible to make an immediate request for mercy.
To her great regret, she therefore remained in a passive role of consolation, and only left Leopold to go and beg him for some sympathy.
Carried away by her gentle eloquence, Mme Eugénie, Édouard, Gustave and Alfred took it in turns to visit Léopold in the old gatehouse and console him as best they could. Bonne-maman herself happened to pass by and poured a drop of balm on the poor child's bleeding wound.
She didn't come directly to him like the others, because she had been deeply hurt by his disobedience and horribly worried about her little Alfred, whose death she would have blamed herself for ever; but she came, and, touched by his great desolation, she forgave him everything.
Only Choucroute resisted Amélie's entreaties: since the accident, he had taken a dislike to Léopold, and Choucroute was as stubborn as a mule.
These sympathetic visits brought some relief to the guilty Léopold, and he was able to attend the dinner with a more or less presentable face.
Amélie, who had hoped that her pallor and flushed eyes would not fail to strike her father, was very disappointed not to see any sign of astonishment in the colonel. She had obtained a change of seat from Gustave, and at the table she devoted much attention to Leopold. He resisted all her efforts, refused to eat and returned his plate full. Amélie's little manoeuvre did, however, draw the colonel's attention to his ward.
Why aren't you eating, Leopold?" he said suddenly; "it seems to me that, despite your neighbour's entreaties, you're not doing much credit to the last meal we had together.
At this word, which in a less severe form nonetheless repeated the dreaded sentence, Leopold could not hold back a stifled sob.
The colonel stared at him. He was obviously very surprised by this sign of grief from a child who had hitherto remained insensitive to everything, at least in appearance.
Amélie had only been waiting for this symptom. Rising quickly to her feet, she rushed to her father's neck and exclaimed:
"Dear father, he is repentant; forgive him.
Alfred, seeing Amélie's movement, was in no hurry to imitate her. Raising himself on the plank of his high chair, he also tied his two little arms around the colonel's neck, who could not help smiling.
Enough!" he said, easily untying the bond of love that seemed to want to make him a prisoner, "you are good-hearted people, but impunity has never corrected anyone. Leopold committed two very serious faults for which he did not even seem to repent.
- Yes! oh yes!" cried Amélie; "see, Papa, how he cries!
- And in the gatehouse he was crying a lot too," cried Alfred.
- Better late than never, my friend," murmured the voice of the grandmother.
- All of you who are talking are irresponsible," said the colonel, who freed himself from his children's embrace, but without removing his daughter, who was leaning on his shoulder. We," he turned to his wife, "are heads of families, that is to say, we are responsible before God and man for all the souls entrusted to us. I overstepped my duty as tutor to Leopold, I took him by force from parents who were bringing him up badly, and you welcomed him as a brother. Nothing overcame his bad nature or his bad habits. His submission was forced, his obedience derisory; he is a malcontent, a spoiled child, and among you he is a living bad example. The undisciplined soldier does not stay in a well commanded regiment, why should the undisciplined child stay in a well governed family? And notice that I am not alluding to the terrible result his last disobedience could have had! I'm not speaking as an angry father, I'm speaking as a reasonable father.
Each of the colonel's words fell heavily on Leopold and only redoubled his bitter grief.
He sobbed convulsively, his head buried in his briefcase.
Father, this time you can't say that the guilty party is unrepentant," ventured Edward; "I've never seen Leopold in such a state.
- I've never seen Leopold in such a state!" cried Amélie, always inspired by her good heart.
And running up to Léopold, she said
Don't you miss us?" she said; "say it! say it!
- Yes, yes," cried the unfortunate man in a voice that was barely intelligible, "yes, it's you I'm sorry for!
- This never ceases to amaze me," said the colonel; "that devil of a child has always given me the effect of a box of surprises. You think he's been reformed, but he does wicked things; you think he's hardened to evil, but he finds tears to soften you up. But let's get it over with. Take him away, console him and don't mention him to me again. Tomorrow I'll give my orders, modified or not, with a clear head.
That was all it took to awaken a whole new hope in the children. They took Léopold away and tried to communicate their own hopes to him.
But he, dismayed and despairing, kept repeating:
"No, no, I saw him the day Alfred was pulled from the sands, my uncle will never forgive me."
XIV -- The ordeal
Whoever, the next morning, had guessed the colonel's intentions would have been well advised.
On these impassive faces which have faced so many times the fire of the enemy, nothing can be read, for nothing can be written.
The colonel went, as was his wont, to smoke his first cigar as he walked along the shore.
In the meantime, Choucroute, following orders received the day before, dressed Léopold in his travelling clothes, and with this valet, the grooming, which had become a sort of twelve-step task, was carried out rapidly.
Amélie and Alfred, standing in the embrasure of a window, were preparing to give the colonel a final assault, but their faces showed more goodwill than hope.
Here's Daddy," said Amélie suddenly. Alfred, let's go and stand on either side of the door.
They dashed forward and stood motionless like two little sentries on either side of the door, waiting for it to open.
The colonel's resounding footsteps could indeed be heard on the stairs, but the door did not open.
He's gone into Mummy's room," said Amélie; "I don't dare go and look for him there, do you, Alfred?
- I do," replied Alfred with the aplomb of a child who fears nothing and knows nothing.
At that moment, the door opened in front of Edouard.
Léopold, my father is asking for you," he said; "he's waiting for you in Mum's room.
- Go left," commanded Choucroute.
Léopold walked behind Édouard, his head low.
Amélie and Alfred followed Léopold and bravely entered the dreaded room.
Mme Dauvellec and Mme Eugénie were seated against a pedestal table with open books; the colonel was pacing up and down the flat as was his wont.
When Léopold entered, he went to lean against the mantelpiece. His face was stern, but when his piercing gaze fixed on the child, a softer expression relaxed his features, and it was in a friendly voice that he asked him:
"Is it true that you regret leaving us?
Leopold did not answer. He looked at his uncle with a look of pain that was more expressive than words.
Secondly," continued the colonel, "are you prepared to do away with certain debasing faults, such as lying, cowardice and greed?
This time Leopold spoke again.
"Yes," he said energetically.
The colonel turned to his wife.
Eugenie," he said, "you may be right: I agree to reduce the sentence.
And, addressing Leopold again, he added:
"Don't get me wrong, it's only a reduced sentence. I agree to keep you, but on two conditions: firstly, you will be placed under the special supervision of Choucroute, you will sleep in his room and you will report to him on all your plans for a walk. Secondly, you will carry out your duties bravely, without idle comments or complaints. At the first complaint, I'll make you leave for Châtel. Do you accept this?
- Yes, Uncle.
- Good; go and tell Sauerkraut to change your uniform and prepare your lodgings.
Léopold disappeared with Amélie and Alfred, whose consolation was precious to him at the moment.
The first condition imposed by the colonel seemed very harsh to him: it was a sort of exile. Encouraged by his aunt and Amélie, he wiped away his tears and bravely accepted the humiliation of his move.
At the far end of the house, above the stables and henhouse, Choucroute occupied a long, narrow closet, the upper part of which was allocated to Léopold.
He was evicted the same day, and the atonement began and continued rigorously.
In the mornings and evenings he found himself there with Choucroute. In the evenings, he no longer fell asleep to the sound of gentle conversation, but to the sound of horses yapping. In the morning he woke not to the sound of Alfred's clear little voice, but to the shrill crowing of the cockerel, his noisy neighbour.
Moreover, the lodgings, as they were called, served only as his dormitory, and only there was he subject to the military regime. Getting up and going to bed was controlled by Choucroute, who beat the diane with his big fingers on a parchment van leaning against his bed. At this significant sound, Leopold rose in silence, dressed quickly and said his prayers.
Choucroute passed a meticulous inspection, then let his room-mate go into the dining room, where he resumed his communal life, the charming life of a family.
Fifteen days of this regime were enough to transform Léopold, even physically. Prompt obedience gave his posture a little of that stiffness that does not suit boys, and his physiognomy a certain resolute quality that also suits them very well. The spoilt child was really coming into his own, and one by one all the prejudices that people had legitimately conceived against him were falling away.
The older cousins no longer shunned his company, because he knew how to take his share of the setbacks and no longer brought with him his chagrin, which is as unpleasant in a child as it is in a man.
As for his aunt, Amélie and even Mme Dauvellec, they encouraged him in his new habits.
Amélie especially watched him with an almost jealous care, and always had one eye on him. She did her best to spare him even a shadow of reproach. Her good advice usually arrived in time to stop the impression she feared.
Leopold, you're frowning," she would say. Leopold, you have a sullen mouth. Leopold, you're behaving badly. Don't say this, don't do that.
Léopold responded to this affectionate supervision with perfect docility and transformed himself visibly.
XV -- The right path
Strangely enough, Leopold was no longer bored. What! wasn't the ultimate happiness to escape surveillance, to follow a whim that turned in all directions, to seek his own amusement, always!
One morning Amélie and Fédik, who were strolling along the shore, spotted him going into the old abandoned hut. They ran over and found him sitting with a book in his lap. He was studying, plugging his ears, no doubt so as not to hear the seductive sound of the sea.
He told Amélie that his uncle was giving him lessons to learn and homework to do so that he could sit the entrance exam for the Collège de la Flèche without too much shame. This is why he had been taking refuge for several days in the old gatehouse, so as not to see anyone or be tempted by the sea or by Fédik.
I'm working very well," he said; "my uncle was pleased with my last assignment. I'm writing on my atlas and I'm staying in the gatehouse until everything is finished.
- You're not crying in there any more?" said Fédik, remembering the painful scene of his dismissal.
- No, but I don't want to forget the day I was so sad to be bad, the day my uncle sent me back to Châtel.
- Oh, you're not bad any more," said Fédik gravely, "not bad at all.
Having made this declaration, he followed Amélie as she left; but suddenly turning back, he said:
"Come and play with me, Léopold.
- And my lesson, Fédik, who will learn it?
- Don't you know your lesson?
- No, I don't know it.
- Never mind, never mind: close your book and come along, I'll give you all the shells to eat.
Of course, Alfred was still only a little creature of instinct; play was the only passion in his life, and he could only vaguely explain the change in his cousin. His tempting little voice had already been heard several times. Leopold, advised by Amélie, was not averse to her tiny influence; but he had never found a clear-cut opportunity to resume the reasonable role given to him by his age and his magnanimous resolutions.
This time the opportunity presented itself well; Alfred had the clever little air of a child who gives advice he knows to be bad: Leopold did not let it slip.
If I didn't learn my lesson, I'd be disobeying my uncle," he said gravely, "and you know very well that I don't want to be disobedient any more.
And, plugging his ears so as not to hear the tempting murmur of the stream, he began to study.
Fédik looked at him with big admiring eyes, full of precocious intelligence, then he jumped on his neck, kissed him and ran off towards the house. He needed to tell someone what he was thinking. He walked straight to Mme Dauvellec who was working by the open window.
Good mother," he said breathlessly, "Léopold is being very good in the guardhouse.
- Isn't he behaving elsewhere?" replied Mme Dauvellec, laughing.
- Oh yes, but especially in the guardhouse.
He approached the housekeeper and added with a humble little shake of his head:
"Because I tried to make him close his book and he said, 'No'.
- That's something to say to the colonel," said Mme Dauvellec with a smile. One more time, Fédik, don't ever disturb your cousin at study time.
Fédik inclined his head in assent, and seeing his father enter, he ran up to him and said in his clear little voice:
"Daddy, how good Léopold is in the guardhouse!
Mr Dauvellec merely smiled and did not pursue the question any further.
Léopold is changing extraordinarily," he said, addressing his mother, "and I'm really astonished by his intelligence. This year he will make up for lost time, and despite everything, his future will not be compromised. Nevertheless, I'd like to give him at least a week's serious work, and if you don't mind, Mother, we'll take him to Coutances tomorrow. Eugenie told me that the sea air was beginning to irritate your bronchi, and I think you should come with me, as my leave is coming to an end.
- May your will be done, my son; however, I don't much like separations. After all, it's only ten days or so, and Eugénie will write to me often.
Drawing Alfred into her arms, she added:
"I shall miss my little Fédik.
- We're taking Fédik with us, Mother; this time I can't do without Choucroute; Choucroute being Fédik's valet, it's impossible to separate them."
And lowering his voice, he added:
"You understand that Eugénie only stays here for Amélie, to whom this fresh, healthy air does so much good; but she cannot look after a child who must always be watched over.
- I'm very happy to be going away with Granny," exclaimed Alfred, "and also to be going by car!
- That's a very accommodating boy," laughed the colonel.
And, opening a door, he said:
"Sauerkraut, you can pack Alfred's trunk.
- Colonel," replied Sauerkraut's voice from the doorway.
- What do you want?
- Madam gave me the order to put Mr Leopold's belongings in your trunk; she thinks that Mr Alfred could put his in his grandmother's trunk. That would only make two parcels.
- That's fair enough. Mother, will you give your little Alfred some hospitality?
- I certainly will. Choucroute, here's my key; please do the tidying up.
- I'll do my own tidying up!" exclaimed Fédik.
- To both of us", said Sauerkraut, laughing.
But Fédik, taking the packing operation very seriously, grabbed the key Mrs Dauvellec was handing to Choucroute and, running to the crate he knew so well, opened it with great skill. Then his good mother took pleasure in watching him running here and there, looking busy, talking to himself and shaking his little head.
But she called to Choucroute with a sign.
Don't let Alfred upset everything in my chest," she said, "put his clothes in there yourself.
- Madame, he doesn't care about that. He just puts things in, but I'll see to it.
Reassured by Choucroute's words, Mme Dauvellec paid no further attention to Alfred. Suddenly the door opened and the little boy's head slipped through the crack.
"Bonne-maman, what's the password?
- What do you mean, the password?
- Yes, Leopold and I are playing sentry; you're the fort sentry, Granny.
- Oh, I didn't know that. Have you finished moving?
Alfred walked over to his grandmother.
Yes," he said, "I packed everything myself. I've put in your box: the sailors, the soldiers, the artillery vans and a mechanical railway.
- Oh my God!" exclaimed Mme Dauvellec, laughing, "is that all there?
- Yes, Granny; and now tell me the password quickly.
- After you've given it to me, my Fédik.
Alfred stood up on tiptoe:
"France and Normandy," he murmured.
And, running to the door, he opened it again and, reinforcing his small voice, said:
"What's the password?
- France and Normandy!
With that, Fédik left and Mme Dauvellec was able to get on with her own move, which took a little longer than the boy's.
At eight o'clock the next morning, the carriage stopped in front of the Auberge de l'Ancre d'Argent. The goodbyes that were exchanged were longer and more emotional than anyone could have imagined the day before.
In organising the successive departures, Mr and Mrs Dauvellec had recognised that meeting in Coutances for a few days would be an unnecessary fatigue and expense. So it had been decided that Mme Eugénie would take Édouard straight to Brest, and that the colonel would pick up Gustave and Léopold in Valognes and take them to La Flèche.
That morning, Granny could not help but feel moved as she kissed her grandsons, whom she would not see again for a long year. And they became very small again for these caresses of the last goodbyes, and their last words were:
"Take good care of yourself, Mummy".
XVI -- At the Prytanée Militaire
The vast halls of the Prytanée, where a large part of France's military generation is raised, are given over to the comings and goings of homecoming day. Families enter in groups, and among this motley crowd circulate the young Fléchois in their stern and ungainly uniforms, which some nevertheless wear with a military swagger.
From time to time a name is called out loudly, the name of the pupil requested.
Two names suddenly rang out:
Gustave Dauvellec, Léopold Massereau.
At the door of the main visiting room appeared a man in a bourgeois suit, but who, like most of the men present, wore his officer's title stamped on his face and in his walk. This senior officer was Colonel Dauvellec, on whose arm Amélie was leaning, having obtained the favour of driving her brother Gustave back to La Flèche.
"Here they are, Daddy," said the young girl, whose pure, penetrating gaze quickly pierced the crowd.
Two students, a little crushed under their heavy bonnets, were rushing towards them. Gustave and Léopold looked like twins. Léopold seems to have grown out of his uniform, and when he puts the red kepi on his curly hair, he is the most charming little infantryman imaginable.
You know we're spending the day together, my children," says the colonel; "the general, whom I saw for a moment, has granted me this favour. Are you ready?
- Léopold will be called to the commissary in half an hour," said Gustave.
- I haven't got a buckle on my belt," said Léopold gravely, squeezing his small, well-curved waist between his fingers.
- And you, Gustave, are you in order?
- Yes, Father.
- Well then, I'll take you with me; we'll be back in an hour to collect Leopold. See you soon, kid.
Léopold disappeared.
The colonel, Amélie and Gustave headed for the front door. They had scarcely crossed the threshold when a lady in a fever, followed by a fat man out of breath, burst into the parlour.
"Where? Who? How do you ask for pupils?" she shouted as she entered.
A non-commissioned officer passing by asked her:
"Did you give your name at the door, Madame?
- Yes, yes, but I'm in a hurry. Please, sir, send for Mr Léopold Massereau as quickly as possible.
And dropping into a chair, she added:
"I told you, Fortuné, that this stop at the buffet would delay us enormously, but you still have to eat.
- Certainly," replied M. Massereau, mopping his brow, "certainly I won't go without lunch just to see Léopold a quarter of an hour earlier.
- My God, how he delays! Here's one who looks extraordinarily like him! That's not him at all. What an awful uniform! Is there any sense in dressing children up like that? For that uniform alone, I would have been opposed to him entering La Flèche. It's martyrdom for a child to be suffocated under that thick sheet.
- My goodness, these little ones seem to be doing very well, my wife.
- You can see that asthma hasn't got hold of them yet, like it has of you. That all this military life is healthy for a child, I deny it, I deny it.
- Deny it, deny it, denial is your business, you have a special talent for it.
- What's taking him so long? Maybe he's in the infirmary.
- Come on, he was very well the day before yesterday, he told you so himself in his letter.
Mme Massereau made a mysterious gesture, and murmured half aloud:
"Do you know what they made him write? I have never believed a word he wrote, and that's why I wanted to come and see for myself. Colonel Dauvellec acted too lightly in this instance. We had to be consulted.
- Why? To put a stop to everything. In my opinion, he acted as he should have. He politely warned you that he had admitted his ward to La Flèche for a thousand good reasons.
- Do these reasons seem good to you?
- Excellent, and when it's just a question of economics, which is nothing to sneeze at, Dauvellec acts as a devoted guardian. When Léopold comes of age, he will be at the head of a small, solid fortune that it would have been a shame to spend on a fanciful education that would have led him nowhere.
- But what if he doesn't have military tastes?
- We'll see.
- And what if the hardships of all kinds make him die of grief?
- We assure you that they strengthen him.
- We'll see. Colonel Dauvellec has no idea that I'm in La Flèche and that if Léopold is languishing... This time there's a child who looks like him, only bigger and stronger. He's coming towards us; if he wasn't so... so well, I'd say it was him.
These last words had been heard by Léopold, who had indeed come running.
It's me, it's really me," he said, "hello, godmother.
It was him, it was indeed him, grown up, browned, transformed, but finally him!
Mme Massereau, however, was not really convinced until Léopold said in her ear:
"And Marie-Céline, godmother, tell me a little about her.
He pronounced the name Marie-Céline so well that she embraced him tightly.
Oh, I see you haven't forgotten us," she said, "and if you're unhappy at this school, I won't let you stay.
- I'm not unhappy at all," said Leopold, laughing.
- You'll write to me, my darling, and it won't be like at the Dauvellec's, you'll be able to tell me everything that's on your mind.
- That's enough," interrupted M. Massereau, tapping the floor with his cane; "I don't suppose you want to put this child off the life that should be his.
- According to Colonel Dauvellec; but if Léopold is too unhappy...
- But, godmother," said Léopold, placing his hands on his aunt's shoulder, "I'm telling you that I'm very happy.
- So much the better. In the meantime, come for a walk with us, I've been told that this day belongs to the parents. Are you ready to go out?
- Yes, godmother, but I have to wait for my uncle.
- Why do you want to do that?
- Because I can't go out without his permission.
- He's right, the child," said M. Massereau; "my poor wife, all you ever think about is doing as you please. Don't get angry, I think this is Dauvellec.
- It's him," said Léopold with a wave of joy.
M. Massereau rose and went to meet the colonel, who still had Amélie on his arm.
My cousin, you here!" cried M. Dauvellec; "allow me to be somewhat surprised.
- My cousin, it's been a long time since I last saw Léopold. You go out of your way for your children, why shouldn't we go out of our way for him?
- Oh, certainly, your devotion is great enough for that. You're like my wife, and you get as much out of your absence as possible. She wanted to take her eldest son to Brest, and if she could have been everywhere at once, you would have met her in this parlour.
- She's a good mother," said M. Massereau, "but let me pay you a compliment, colonel: your ward looks superb.
- Hasn't he? He's almost outgrown Gustave in these two months of holiday.
- He's very thin," remarked Mme Massereau.
- A precious defect!" sighed M. Massereau, folding his hands over his enormous chest.
- Have you got your leave, Léopold?
- Yes, Uncle.
The colonel turned to Mme Massereau:
"Are you taking Léopold with you, my cousin?
- If you allow me, my cousin.
- Certainly, it's only fair that he should spend this afternoon with you. We'll meet up again, as the town isn't very big and we don't know many people there. The commanding general is in charge of getting our children out. Massereau will do well to bring him his card.
- I'll do that, Colonel.
- Go at once, Fortuné," said Mme Massereau, "I'll wait for you here.
With these words they parted. The colonel and his children left the parlour, and Mr Massereau, having given his card to the commandant of the school, returned to pick up his wife and nephew.
Léopold strolled through the town with Mr and Mrs Massereau. To his godmother's great surprise, he was very reserved at the pastry shops where she was happy to take him.
It was in vain that she turned the shop upside down to find the sweets he liked; Léopold never accepted more than a measured quantity, which greatly edified Mr Massereau.
I was waiting for him there," he grumbled after a hearty lunch in a patisserie. There's no need to say, he's no longer greedy".
Naturally, he kept his thoughts to himself; his wife, all for Leopold, would have paid no attention to them.
At the agreed time, they made their way back to the Rue du Château. A very affectionate farewell was exchanged in the parlour, and in taking leave of Léopold, Mme Massereau gave him some advice which brought a mischievous smile to her husband's fat lips.
Well, well, let's preach wisdom, obedience and discipline to him now," he murmured; "better late than never.
Fortunately his wife did not hear him.
As she left the school, she wiped the tears of separation from her wet eyes and, taking her husband's arm warmly, said:
It costs me a lot to leave him," she said, "but you have to think about his future.
- I'm pleased to see that you, like me, find him much changed," said the excellent man with an intelligent smile. He's become quite nice. What docility! what friendliness! what cheerfulness!
Mme Massereau stopped and looked at him fixedly:
You recognise him at last," she said, "he's a very likeable person.
- Oh, he's charming, three times charming.
Mme Massereau swallowed her pride and, pushing aside the small barriers that separated them from the station, she majestically uttered this incredible sentence:
"And yet here was the child I had brought up so badly!
The sound of something rolling on the asphalt answered her.
It was Mr Massereau's cane, which had escaped from his hands, which he was raising mechanically towards the sky.
So," he said, "you didn't think to thank Colonel Dauvellec.
- What would I thank him for?
- Ah, this is too much. Excuse me, here he is with his daughter; go on, go on, I'll join you.
M. Massereau ran after Colonel Dauvellec, who was going with Amélie to a first-class carriage.
Are you leaving, Colonel?" he said breathlessly.
- Ten minutes before you, my dear Massereau.
- Well, farewell and thank you for all you have done for this poor child who, my goodness! thanks to you, to you alone, I am very pleased to say, no longer looks the same.
- I've had many helpers in this work," replied the colonel, smiling at his daughter.
- In any case, this child, spoilt to the core, has become reasonable and charming.
- It's true," replied the colonel seriously, "his will has got the better of his caprice, his intelligence and his heart are developing harmoniously. If he has a taste for arms, France will have one more good officer. If he doesn't, he will always be a useful citizen for his country, because he will be capable of devotion.
With these grave words they parted. Mr Massereau joined his wife, who was waiting for him with unusual patience. The colonel and Amélie climbed into the carriage, giving a last look at the school, where Léopold Massereau was about to strip himself of all those silly, tyrannical habits, selfish feelings and precocious troubles that distinguish the unfortunate person to whom the terrible name of spoilt child can be applied.
