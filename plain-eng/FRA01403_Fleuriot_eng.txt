I -- The charity sale
- Is that you?
- It is me.
- Are you in Paris, wandering man, happy David?
- I've been in Paris for four days, my dear Dragonneau.
A young man, very elegant in appearance, but very French in accent and bearing, was the first to exclaim his astonishment when he saw a young gum man of the finest water, very foreign in bearing and accent.
The latter answered him from the top of a phaeton which had become entangled in the middle of a compact group of cars of all kinds, stopped at Place Vendôme, opposite the Ministry of Justice.
- Go and wait for me at the corner of the rue Castiglione," said the young foreigner to the liveried servant sitting below him.
And, jumping to his feet, he shook hands with the passer-by.
- Where do you come from, Louzéma?
- Vienna.
- And how are you finding Paris now?
The young man, with his dull complexion, aquiline nose and receding forehead, placed his fingers on his thick, red lips:
- Exquisite," he said.
And he added:
- Where are you going, Dragonneau?
His interlocutor raised his hand towards the hanger of the nearest carriage entrance.
- To the Ministry of Justice?" said David, who had followed the movement of his hand.
- No, alas! Read on.
- Charity sale for the benefit...
- That's it, my dear, that's all too true.
- Do you know what a charity sale is?
- Just about. It's a sort of fair where the women you know run shops selling cigars, bouquets and curios.
- Are you in a hurry? Would you like me to accompany you to the sale?
- It would be a pleasure. I would just warn you that these kinds of commercial exhibitions are a real ambush.
And as he and his companion walked towards the Ministry of Justice, he continued:
- If I didn't have special reasons not to displease the wife of my boss, at whose house I sometimes dine and who sent me a card, I wouldn't be going to this sale.
The young stranger made a carefree gesture.
- As for me," he said, "I would gladly give a few gold coins for the smiles of these pretty actresses, who, like real sirens,...
As they chatted, they crossed a narrow courtyard, climbed a flight of steps and entered a grandiose vestibule.
It was here that David's obviously unkind words rang out, for his companion glanced around quickly and then came up to him:
- My dear, these are not actresses you are going to find," he said in a low voice.
- Ah! I've always heard that in Paris they get into everything.
- No, no," replied the young Frenchman, who obviously belonged to the self-respecting world, with some embarrassment. It's still the honest women who have the monopoly on charity.
And he added more quietly:
- We'll leave that to them.
With that, he climbed the majestic staircase, and at the behest of a man in livery, in the service of the Republican minister of the day, he passed, uncovering himself, into the first salon, which had been transformed into a buffet.
In this buffet, which is not the least profitable part of a charity sale, none of the elegant salesgirls grabbed them as they passed. The ladies generally let them in. It is at the exit that a white hand is placed with an engaging air on the handle of the silver container containing the punch or chocolate, and it is then that the golden plates are passed around, covered with delicate cakes that can be said to be priceless.
The young people passed through the salons, picking up a lottery ticket here, a flower there offered by a graceful child who was still stumbling.
But there were no indiscreet requests.
Charity sales have been much maligned. They were only really fearsome for the purse at the dawn of their invention. Now that their heyday is past, there is no longer any need to commit extravagant acts of generosity, and men need no longer fear getting lost in them.
David's friend was in no way robbed, and by the time he reached the far end of the last salon, where a wide-eyed Polish countess ran a shop selling precious trinkets, he had not spent twenty francs.
Opposite this counter, a young woman of royal race was also selling, but in true princess fashion.
Sitting at the back of the counter, she gazed with a certain indifference into the deep blue eyes of the crowd that gathered in front of her royal shop, and left it to her shop girls to serve the shoppers.
While M. Dragonneau searched through the elegant knick-knacks of the beautiful Polish countess for an object that might suit him, David examined the paintings hanging on the panelling and smiled at the contrast between the austere figures of the great French magistrates and the feminine faces that swarmed around them.
Suddenly his eyes lowered mechanically and his face became attentive.
His piercing eyes had met a tall young girl with chestnut hair, who was passing by selling roses that were no more satiny or fresh than her cheeks.
The young stranger even took a few steps forward to follow her, then changed his mind and rejoined M. Dragonneau, who, finally making up his mind, bought forty francs worth ten, a cigar holder with the most charming smile on his face.
- Where are you going?" asked David, grabbing his arm. We have nothing to see on this side. Just take me through this large salon where a rose and violet seller, whom I want to see again, has just wandered off.
The friend relented and the two young men went through the second salon, which was very crowded at the moment.
- Well, have you found her?" asked Monsieur Dragonneau.
- No; but what a crowd!
- Ah! there she is. Look over there, at that counter in the corner where you can see that lady who is as curly as she is skinny.
- The Marquise de Valroux.
- Perhaps she is. Tell me, do you know the young lady I'm pointing out to you?
- All I see at this counter is Mademoiselle Bellinard, the Baroness de Lichtnel...
- I'm telling you she's a young girl. Look a little to the left, she's standing against a panoply. She's wearing a blue-grey jumper, with magnificent chestnut hair. She's getting out of the way. Well, let's see, my dear, she stands out quite a bit against this background of more or less ugly ladies.
- Ah, I've got it, she's wearing a basket of violets and roses as a necklace.
- Precisely. And her name?
- Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- Ah, do you know her first name?
- Something like... Let's see, it has often been pronounced in front of me. Roberte, Alberte...
- Alberte," interrupted David, "that's it.
And he added with a smile:
- The little duchess (1).
- She's not a duchess at all, my dear David.
- She is, as I understand it, from an already distant memory. Tell me, do you know her at all? Have you been introduced to her?
- I know her through Roger de Châteaugrand and his brother-in-law Médéric de Valroux.
- Come closer then. Let me see her up close.
- My dear, just a moment. Her sister the Marquise de Valroux is going to rob us, I warn you. You're leading me into a trap.
- Go on," replied David with his carefree gesture, "you've bought from your boss and from that lovely Polish girl with the big eyes. Now it's my turn.
And he led the young Parisian, who was mechanically reaching into his waistcoat pocket as he made his way towards the large counter manned by graceful little women, who were all the more active in their trade because they had never known anything about commerce.
One of them, the small, thin, curly woman whom Monsieur Dragonneau had called the Marquise de Valroux, spotted him and rushed towards the corner of the counter he was about to pass.
- It's very kind of you, sir, not to forget us," she said. Médéric predicted that you wouldn't forget us. This morning he said to me: You can be sure of a visit from my friend Dragonneau. What would you like? A match-holder, an inkwell, a watch-holder, a bunting, a teapot, a purse, a badine, some colonial goods?
And she laughed at herself.
Mr Dragonneau turned to his companion.
- David, what would you choose?" he said, not without a hint of malice.
- Madam," said David, bowing deeply, "I'm surprised not to see any flowers in your shop.
- But we do have flowers. Mademoiselle Bellinard, please pass your bouquets.
And Mademoiselle Bellinard, a very beautiful and serious person, passed round a large basket full of ravishing flowers, saying:
- These are the work of the young apprentices, sir.
- Yes, yes, and it's a double charity to buy them," said the Marquise de Valroux volubly. Buying this, sir, means getting to the heart of the work, which is so beautiful and so touching.
Stopping short, Madame de Valroux, who had never set foot in a studio, added with a smile:
- Mademoiselle Bellinard, you who know her so well, you who are so devoted to all this, come and interest these gentlemen a little. You know that it was you who fanatised my sister, who fanatised all of us with your sublime ideas about this work, which I confess I know little about. Come and persuade these gentlemen to buy our flowers.
- Your graciousness will suffice, Madame," David replied gallantly.
He took a sprig of white heather between his fingers, and with his other hand placed a hundred-franc note in the Marquise de Valroux's hand.
- Change, quick," asked the Marquise, turning upside down a box containing white coins; "I've only got about twenty francs to give back to the gentleman.
- You don't have to give me anything back, madame, this flower is charming, as charming as the hand that gave it to me. I'm only sorry that you're missing it.
He wandered his eyes around the counter.
- What, sir?" asked the marquise, who was waving the blue note mechanically with a small gesture of triumph.
- That you don't sell natural flowers; I love them.
- But we do, sir, we do. Ladies, where is Alberte? Look for Alberte. Where is she? What happened to her? She keeps missing the sale.
- She was here just a moment ago.
- Sir, if you'll wait a minute, my sister will give you the flowers we had sent from Nice. But it's especially in winter that there should be natural flowers at charity sales. Ladies, go and get Alberte, I can't think of a more careless saleswoman.
Several ladies rushed off in search of the rose seller, and she soon reappeared surrounded by dragging skirts that only hindered her progress.
Mademoiselle Alberte de la Rochefaucon was a very pretty woman of twenty, who combined in her person, in the most harmonious measure, the elegance of modern aristocracy and the robust vitality of those great military races who had never consented to grow weary in the courts, but in whom the active life of the camps sustained the strength and richness of the blood.
The slightly proud, albeit natural, pose of his head, adorned with opulent light brown hair, gave him, especially from a distance, a dignity quite different from haughtiness and even more from impertinence. Up close, her delightful smile and the gentleness of her gaze made her extremely attractive.
The look! That's where we have to look for the degree of power given by intelligence and love. So when in those mysterious flames of the eyes, which seem to have been lit by the fire of heaven, the mind and the heart seem to melt into a single flame, beauty captivates supremely and ugliness itself is transfigured.
Before reaching the counter, Alberte, having been informed of what was expected of her, went straight to the two young men and gracefully handed them her basket of flowers.
David, with his piercing gaze fixed on her, began to rummage randomly through the violets and roses.
- These flowers have a truly delicious fragrance," he said. Under what sun did they bloom, mademoiselle?
- Under the Nice sun, sir; we send them direct from Nice. These are from yesterday, these arrived this morning.
Hearing this deep, pearly voice, David smiled, a smile that might have seemed strange to the young girl if she hadn't been looking down at her flowers.
The memory that was obviously guiding the young man in his curious search had suddenly emerged from the regions of vagueness to enter into full reality.
He had known Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon before, that was certain; nevertheless, he could only recognise her by putting together one by one the elements scattered in his memory; but she had spoken, and at the magical sound of that exquisite voice, what doubts remained in his mind had suddenly vanished.
There are voices that you only need to hear once to remember them forever.
- The flowers of Cannes are beautiful too," he said, taking up a rose held out to him by Alberte, and fixing on her the scrutinising gaze of his dark eyes.
- Very beautiful," she replied simply.
- I know the flowers of Cannes.
- And I too, sir, allow me to tell you that the flowers of Nice are second to none in radiance or perfume.
And she plucked a violet from a superb bunch, which David hastened to join to the rose he held between his fingers.
Then he placed the two flowers in his buttonhole and, dropping a five hundred franc note into Alberte's basket, he bowed deeply and walked away.
- Five hundred francs, two flowers!" said the Marquise de Valroux, taking the note from the bottom of her sister's basket.
- It's clear that this gentleman is one of the family," said a fat lady who was jealous of this rich windfall, "he's yellow and ugly as an Oriental.
The Marquise de Valroux protested vehemently.
She thought her buyer was very handsome, a bit Jewish in type; but it was very well worn.
Mademoiselle Bellinard, who listened with a smile to everything they said, ended the dispute by saying to Alberte, who was passing the ticket to the cashier:
- Alberte, in any case, you're doing our business. Does this generous young man know you? Have you ever met him in public?
- No, Miss, I must be meeting him for the first time, and yet I wouldn't swear I'd never seen him.
While these comments were being made, David and Mr Dragonneau moved quickly through the last rooms.
In the vestibule where the liveries were held, the young Parisian said to David:
- My dear, for a few days you will be something of a hero in the eyes of the Marquise de Valroux. But your generosity astounds me! And are you to be counted among Roger de Châteaugrand's rivals?
- Who is this gentleman?
- A suitor for the hand of Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- Châteaugrand!" murmured David, another name from the past.
He went down a few steps, and taking Mr Dragonneau's arm familiarly to leave the hall, he added:
- My dear fellow, if you assume a mystery, whatever it may be, you lack flair. It's the most innocent story in the world. Above all, don't tell it and don't let me see it printed tomorrow.
"Here's the fact: when I was a child, I spent a whole season in Cannes with my sister Luna.
"My uncle's villa adjoined that of the Duchess de la Rochefaucon and we lived next door to her little niece Alberte, who had escaped from college... no... from the convent.
"Nothing or almost nothing remains of these childhood friendships for us foreigners, who have acquaintances all over the world. But this one had a very special flavour and was a milestone in our lives. My sister had even thought of joining the convent of the Sacred Heart, for the love of the one they had nicknamed the little duchess.
"But after a year, she'd had enough.
"And really, I'd forgotten all about the little duchess.
"Luna, who doesn't much like cells and who had only stayed a year at the convent in Paris, was no more faithful to her memory than I was. It was so well erased that when we came back from the Exhibition two years ago, her name was not even mentioned between us.
"But this young girl happened to look at me in passing, and the memory of Alberte de la Rochefaucon immediately came back to me.
"You saw how I got to know her again. I had to hear her speak, because her child's voice was already unlike any other.
- His few words were golden, my dear, they cost you five hundred francs.
- Peuh!" said David, "what's that? Besides, I must confess that I greatly admire French women who are concerned with charity. They begin these things when they are witty, sophisticated, young and charming, whereas our women are only occupied with grooming and pleasure.
"Religions are as indifferent to me as any other; but it would be childish to deny that the Catholic religion is a school of devotion and self-sacrifice that is quite superior.
- There are those who, from this very remarkable fact, logically deduce that it is the only true religion, since charity consists even more in works than in faith.
David replied with his annoyed gesture and said:
- My dear, don't raise these awkward questions and tell me where and when I'll find you.
- I'm at home, rue Saint-Dominique, 112, every day from midday to one o'clock, after lunch.
- And I'm at the Hotel Continental. I can't tell you the day or the time, but I'll come and see you.
With that, the two young men shook hands.
Léon Dragonneau, who knew how volatile relations with foreigners can be, walked up the Place Vendôme, telling himself in petto that he was not ready to see David again, and David walked down the Rue Castiglione to the Hotel Continental.
In the courtyard, he seemed to hesitate; but as his eyes fell on the glass doors facing him, he made out a group of women entering the Moorish salons and headed in that direction.
One of them, a charming girl with a supple waist, ebony hair, singularly slit but beautiful eyes and a mouth of red coral, stood out from the group and came up to him, her hand outstretched and a smile on her lips:
- David, are you dining with us?
- If you like, Luna," replied David, shaking hands with the ladies present and waving to two mothers sitting in armchairs.
- Oh, David, you're so sweet!
And three or four little girls with velvet sheaths and silk hair, who had followed Luna, added:
- Oh, Mr David, how nice you are!
Then, at a sign from the mothers who had risen with watches in hand, they all headed for the dining room, followed by some serious gentlemen who had joined David and were speaking to him in English.
- One more place setting," ordered one of the mothers as they sat down at a round table that was obviously reserved for them.
- Madam, you forget that I always set a place for David next to mine," remarked Luna with her radiant smile.
And she pressed her finger against the gilt scroll that held a white napkin to the plate next to it.
David thanked her with his eyes, and the little colony began to dine.
After the crayfish bisque came the champagne, which all the strangers, both men and women, drank from full goblets as soon as the meal began, and David seized a moment when a little girl who wasn't eating was being looked after, to say to his sister:
- Guess, Luna, who I've just met in Paris.
- I can't guess riddles," replied Luna.
And she added, turning to her neighbour:
- Carmen, ask David, please.
The young Cuban she was talking to was very ugly, but very intelligent.
- Is it a man, Mr David?" she asked.
- No, Miss.
- Is it a girl?
- Yes, Miss.
- From what country? English?
- No, Miss.
- American?
- No. Algerian?
- Algerian?
- Algerian?
- Spanish?
- No. Parisian?
- Parisian?
- Yes and no.
- French, in any case?
- Yes and no. French, in any case?
- Luna, go on," she says, "I don't know all the French women you know.
- But you do, Carmen, you do. You were with us when we visited the Universal Exhibition. David, tell us quickly the name of this unknown woman.
- Take a guess.
- Is she a loved one?" Carmen asked again.
- She's very much loved.
Luna was astonished and dropped the partridge wing she was holding on the end of her fork onto her plate.
- Then," she exclaimed, "she must be very well known to us. Let's see, who is she?
- Take a guess.
- Is she blonde?
- Just about.
- Is she tall?
- Yes, she's tall.
- Pretty?
- Very pretty.
- Beautiful?
- Yes and no.
- What colour are her eyes?
- Sea blue.
- Does she have a famous name?
- Her name is not vulgar.
- What is her pet name?
- Ah, you're on fire, Carmen, I can tell by the look on my brother's face," cried Luna; answer quickly, David.
- Her name is Alberte.
- I've never known one," said Carmen, looking at Luna.
Luna's velvet eyes had involuntarily lowered.
Suddenly she looked at her brother and exclaimed:
- Alberte de la Rochefaucon, the little duchess?
David inclined his head in assent.
- Oh, I want to see her again! Where, how and when did you see her?
David recounted his visit to the sale.
His sister gasped impatiently.
- And you didn't tell her about me," she exclaimed when he'd finished, "you didn't make yourself known?
- It was neither the time nor the place.
- Oh, I would have," said Luna. Where is this sale? I want to go.
- It's over, Luna, we've got to find another way of finding you and Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- Which one, David? Which one, Carmen? But there's no point in taking so many detours: I'll simply go to her house.
- And I, who cannot act with such simplicity, how will I do it, my sister?
- I'll say to her: David is dying to talk to you about the past, let him come with me.
- You're forgetting that we're talking about a French woman from the aristocracy, very virtuous and very high up.
- Let's look for another way. In our colony, there must be someone who knows one of her relatives or intimates.
Carmen drew an ivory notebook from her pocket and prepared a cute gilt pencil:
- I'll take care of it," she said, "dictate the names to me, Mr David.
David dictated a few names: Alberte's, his sister's and those of the other shop assistants.
- That's good," said the young American, clutching her notebook, "within two days I'll have found someone who knows this girl.
We had reached dessert and the conversation, which began in Spanish, became more or less general until everyone got up from the table.
-- Come on, let's go to the Opera, Faust is on; are you coming, David? asked Luna.
David replied that he was engaged and that, besides, he preferred Offenbach's music to that of Gounod, and he slipped away with a young man closely related to Carmen who had come to fetch him, leaving the ladies to prepare their theatrical toilet.
II -- The two sisters
The next day, a carriage stopped in front of an old hotel in the rue de Lille. A young officer of the dragoons got out first, and offered his hand to a white-haired woman whose delicate features had such an affinity with his beautiful features that the first passer-by would have guessed that this woman was his mother.
They made their way to the front door at the end of the courtyard, and the young man, who had inspected the high windows with an attentive eye, gave a resounding ring.
- Madame la marquise de Valroux?" he asked the servant who presented himself.
- Madame is out.
- Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon?
- Mademoiselle has gone out with Madame.
The young officer turned away in disappointment towards his mother.
- Monsieur le Marquis de Valroux?" she asked in turn.
- He's out too.
- Roger, have you got your card?" she asked as she came down the steps.
He leaned towards her.
- Shall we go in and wait?
She nodded.
- No," she said, "this servant is unknown to us, Madeleine has changed her people again; we'll be back, my son. Don't forget to add my name and address to your card; Alberte will arrange to come and find me.
He obeyed, wrote a few words in pencil on a card, handed it to the servant and walked slowly, as if reluctantly, down the wide staircase.
The servant closed the door and climbed the stairs, map in hand.
As he reached the landing, a light footstep and the rustle of a dress were heard, and Alberte de la Rochefaucon crossed it.
- John, who are these visitors?" she asked, her voice slightly moved.
John handed her the card.
Alberte read half aloud:
ROGER DE CHÂTEAUGRAND
Lieutenant of Dragoons, and his mother had gone to the Hôtel du Louvre.
- Something told me that this lady, whom I only caught a glimpse of as she crossed the courtyard, was my aunt de Châteaugrand. Why didn't you receive them?
- By order of Madame de Châteaugrand.
- Madame de Châteaugrand didn't ask for me?
- I'm sorry, but Madame de Châteaugrand had said: I'm going out with my sister, it's not our fault.
Alberte's face flushed with annoyance, and she stretched out her hand towards the street; but just as she was about to give an order, she heard the sound of wheels on the pavement; it was the carriage leaving.
- Too late," she murmured.
And she lost herself in the depths of the vast corridor, murmuring:
- I'm going to find out why Madeleine, who entertains her friends, won't let me entertain my Aunt de Châteaugrand.
She knocked lightly, but firmly, on a door half-hidden under an outside door, and entered her sister's house.
Madame la Marquise de Valroux was chatting half sunken in an armchair at the corner of a fireplace, whose high iron andirons must have seen oak flames, but between which had been placed an elegant cast-iron basket, at that moment filled with incandescent coke.
- It's my sister," she said carelessly to a young woman who was keeping her company.
Alberte, on seeing the stranger, stopped the request that was coming to her lips and replied with a slightly cold politeness to some eager questions about her health, which in truth did not call for such tender interest.
- I'm not telling you to sit down," said the Marquise de Valroux, "because I guess you've come to ask me something.
- Mademoiselle, don't be embarrassed, I'm going away," said the stranger, moving her armchair a few steps.
- My dear, stay; Alberte knows perfectly well that I have no secrets from you.
Alberte, accustomed as she was to her sister's strange whims, could not contain a slight movement of surprise.
The friend present was an acquaintance from the last watering season, and an acquaintance very slightly accepted by the Marquise de Valroux, who had been warned, but in vain, that the most unfortunate rumours had been circulating about the young woman the Baron de Lextreville had given himself.
The Marquise de Valroux, who would not have consented to mix with a world other than that into which a woman never enters except through the narrow gate of honour, nevertheless had strange blindnesses, and bound herself with imperturbable lightness. It is true that she also untied herself. Her eccentric friendships lasted so short that she didn't have time to see their bad fruits ripen.
- There's nothing mysterious about what I have to ask you," replied Alberte after a rather awkward silence. It seems that you gave orders not to receive.
- That's the way it is, Alberte; I only told John about certain people whose visit would bore me today.
- Is our Aunt de Châteaugrand one of them today?
- She certainly is.
- Madeleine, I don't understand you.
- Come now, you know that she distresses me more and more, and that everything around me has to be absolutely rosy for me to be able to bear her visit.
She turned to Madame de Lextreville and, speaking volubly, added:
- Just think, my dear, that the Countess de Châteaugrand, our second cousin, had the misfortune to lose a twenty-year-old son, and that she was inconsolable. It's a terrible misfortune, I know. If I lost Agnès or Maurice, I might feel the same way; but in the end, my children are doing well and I don't like to brood with Madame de Châteaugrand. Her Jean was a charming boy, as seductive as they come, like all chest sufferers. Have you noticed that people with chest pains always have the most beautiful eyes in the world? But in the end, a bereavement doesn't last ten years. The misfortune is immense, but one takes it in one's stride.
"Madame de Châteaugrand did not see it that way. After the death of her son, she withdrew from the world. She lives like a recluse, dresses in black cashmere, and gives you one of those Maintenon-like looks that chills everything around them.
- Madeleine, this is pure fantasy," said Alberte: "my Aunt de Châteaugrand is kindness and friendliness itself.
- For you, it's possible, and her reasons are no mystery to anyone. As far as I'm concerned, her severity has been totally unfair. Madame de Châteaugrand does not understand the modern world, any more than our dear late great-aunt, the Duchesse de la Rochefaucon, did.
- Be that as it may, I would ask you to allow me to receive her, and not to give collective orders without warning me.
- I shall do so. Today I had given orders to John, planning to go to the lake. But I've got a little nerve point in my temple that won't let me go out. Besides, Médéric can't come with us. Do you like skating, Madame?
- I don't know how, and Monsieur de Lextreville won't let me learn, fearing falls on the ice.
- Oh come on! it doesn't kill you. We skate as a family: it's great fun.
- I'd like to see you doing this exercise, which shows off so much of your personal grace.
- Well, come along tomorrow. I'll have a place to give you, as Médéric is up to his neck in his photographic trials.
- I'll go; they say it's charming.
- Charming; especially this year, when there's no danger to be feared: the ice is rock solid. Well, Alberte, are you leaving?
- Yes, I'm going to write a note of apology and regret to my aunt at Châteaugrand.
- Add my own, if you like. I really regret not getting on with her, especially on certain subjects. That's enough, isn't it? Don't worry, this is an enigma that the Baroness de Lextreville will never be able to guess.
And, addressing the young woman who had just responded to Alberte's last curtsy, she added:
- How do you like my sister? More pretty than nice, isn't she?
The young woman, who had perfectly grasped the nuances of the impression Alberte was feeling at the moment the Marquise de Valroux gave her as her confidante, replied with a smile full of mischief; then, assuming the abandoned pose on her armchair that Alberte's entrance had made her lose, she continued:
- Am I being indiscreet in guessing that the name Châteaugrand is intimately linked to the little novel you told me the other evening at the Countess Mirbier's party?
Madame de Valroux shuddered and exclaimed:
- My dear, you can guess everything. He's a dangerous gift, you know? Yes, this young dragoon officer who dreams of becoming my brother-in-law is Roger de Châteaugrand.
- And why shouldn't he be? That's what all the insight you give me didn't let me guess.
- I certainly told you. Several members of my family are against it, myself in the lead.
- But that's not enough to stop something like Miss Alberte's will.
- Of course, Alberte also has her own particular, personal motive. Otherwise, as you quite rightly assume, she would have gone ahead a long time ago. In the family, we rely on Roger de Châteaugrand's fortune, which is less than hers, on the unpleasant life that awaits her at Châteaugrand, transformed into a veritable hermitage since Jean's death, on the question of her health, on this, on that.
"She has only one point of resistance, but it is a solid one, given Roger's attachment to his epaulettes: the need to run from garrison to garrison following an officer husband.
"As you see it, she is very home-loving, she admires the life of those medieval chatelaines who mourned the departure of their husbands for the crusade, and who spun, solitary, while waiting for him.
"The nomadic life of the regiment, which would have suited me so well and which I would have loved so passionately, is so repugnant to her that it thwarts her deep sympathy for Roger and her great and inconceivable affection for his mother.
"Without this, without this bias, she would have planted us and our hopes a long time ago.
"Because, in the family, we have great hopes for Alberte. We would like her to have a great marriage, a complete marriage, where birth, fortune and position would be united.
- It's difficult, when you don't want to sacrifice pretensions to the person.
- Of course, she would never marry an idiot or an old man," said the Marquise de Valroux with a completely unconscious absent-mindedness.
- Well, she would, especially if she had to!" replied Madame de Lextreville with a bitter smile.
And passing her embroidered handkerchief over her lips, she added banteringly:
- I brought our little affair of the other day to a successful conclusion, and not without difficulty. I had to search all the registers of the big hotels in Paris; but at last I know the name of your young nabob.
- At last!" exclaimed Madame de Valroux; "is he a real mogul, at least?
- He's a very rich mogul, an Indian by birth.
- Very good, very good. I knew he wasn't a Jew. What was his name?
Madame de Lextreville took a small paper folded in four from her sleeve, opened it and read:
- The Louzéma family, well known in London and highly esteemed, is headed by David Louzéma, who travels with his sister Luna and an aunt, the daughter of an English general who died in India. A colossal fortune, amassed in the diamond trade, the highest of all trades, as you can see.
- I did notice his cufflinks," says Madame de Valroux, "real opals. Ah! His name is... what was it?
- Louzéma.
- It's not absolutely vulgar; it even has a certain kinship with the name of the unfortunate King of Mexico. It seems to me that Madame la Duchesse de la Rochefaucon spoke to me of people with that name. She called them the Montézuma, which made Alberte laugh a lot.
- It was more noble, indeed, but our nabobs don't need nobility, they have so much money!
- I could tell from his generosity that he was made of gold.
She rested her forehead on her hands and murmured:
- Ah, gold, what power! I don't see these foreigners without envying them a little.
- So do I," added Madame de Lextreville, who had also become pensive. What a relief to never have to worry about anything, whatever the expense!
"So here are these Louzéma installed at the Continental, at a hundred francs a day, not to mention the servants, and giving themselves pleasure after pleasure, without it denting their income one cent.
- What a happy life! When I go abroad - and I love travelling - I have to endure six months of savings and recriminations.
"That is why I urge Alberte to choose from among her suitors, not the most titled, not the most handsome, but the richest.
- Even if she were one day to be called Madame David Louzéma?
Madame de Valroux made a movement.
- There's no question of this nabob yet, Madame," she said.
- And what if I told you that this mogul admires her very much and follows her wherever she goes, without showing his face, of course!
- Is that possible?
- It is; I am very well informed by a Spanish lady. I'm going to surprise you, but there's been a lot of talk about your sister Alberte in this group of foreigners since the day of the sale.
- What a surprise! That first meeting would have had such a powerful effect!
- The effect was based on a memory: Mr David and Mademoiselle Alberte knew each other as children.
- Where? How? I've never seen Indians in Paris.
- They spent a season in Cannes, in one of the neighbouring villas.
- Ah, I remember. During one of my trips to Scotland, I left Alberte, who couldn't stand boarding school, in the care of our aunt de la Rochefaucon, who took her to Cannes and la Rochefaucon. She came back converted.
- I don't suppose the little Indians had anything to do with it," remarked Madame de Lextreville with a sly smile. They were very spoilt, I'm told, and these days they're nothing less than saints.
- How do you mean?
- Oh, nothing serious. The young girl rides, dances, sings, and is one of the most intrepid in the foreign colony. I don't know anything about him, but he's probably like all the young men who have millions to throw out of the window.
- Is theirs a real fortune?
- Very real indeed.
- And how much is it?
- The brother and sister have something like a million in annuities.
- A million!
- When the first marriage takes place, it will only be five hundred thousand francs for each of them.
- What!" exclaimed Madame de Valroux; "you can talk about that all you like, you who have no children and no expenses. Five hundred thousand francs' income is superb. No suitor of Alberte's has ever reached that figure. Why is this young man Indian? He's a real sweetheart.
- He's a very civilised Indian, madame; if it weren't for his complexion, you'd take him for a pure-blooded Parisian.
- He certainly is. You say he's noticed Alberte?
- He's very busy about it; he's looking for a way to be properly introduced. Would you agree to see him?
- Why not? I'd like to ask you whether in this day and age people refuse to let strangers of this distinction into their homes.
- There would be a hundred ways of making you meet them.
- There are a thousand.
- Choose one.
- Well, let's see!
The marquise became pensive; then she exclaimed:
- Do your Indians skate?
- I know they intend to.
- Well, you're coming with us tomorrow. Let them go pigeon shooting themselves. You meet them, we meet you, and you introduce them to me.
- All right, then. The ice will be broken all the more quickly as Mademoiselle Alberte will probably be delighted to see her old acquaintance from Cannes.
- We'll see about that. Alberte has never spoken to me about her except with indifference, and she's full of prejudices. But we'll try. One more suitor will be one more adversary for Roger de Châteaugrand, and I don't want this marriage, no, I don't want it.
And his foot struck the carpet several times with a feverish movement.
- It's up to your experience to guide this young girl," said Madame de Lextreville, rising to her feet. I'll help you with this. Tomorrow we begin hostilities, with the presentation. I'll prepare the things and the people; but don't let your sister miss the meeting.
- Oh, don't worry, she loves to skate and my daughter would train her by force if she had to. You can count on us.
- I will. If we missed this little game, we'd miss everything at once. Several Spaniards want to drag the Louzéma family to St Petersburg and their departure from Paris is only a hair's breadth away, a hair's breadth away from Mademoiselle Alberte.
- I find that hard to believe," replied Madame de Valroux, rising in her turn. Until tomorrow, then. Should I pick you up?
- Be so kind.
- Would two o'clock suit you?
- Perfectly; the appointment is for three o'clock. Will you tell your sister?
- I'd be careful not to; I'd stir up some prejudice. No, no, this is between us... and let's be a little careful. Don't get ahead of yourself, because after all... this Indian... a diamond merchant... a Louzéma!
- And five hundred thousand francs in income.
- Ah, that's superb," said Madame de Valroux with a heavy sigh; "that's magic, Madame.
They shook hands and Madame de Lextreville left, saying:
- See you tomorrow.
III -- Skating
The next day, just before two o'clock, the Marquise de Valroux's carriage was waiting for her in front of the hotel.
The coachman, his nose buried in his fur cape, was struggling to keep his ice-shod horses, to which the biting cold was giving unusual ardour.
But he had to wait, as the Marquise de Valroux would not go down without her sister, and Alberte refused, for some reason, to go skating that day.
Madame Valroux, whose frail little person disappeared into her rich furs, continued to fight her sister's resolve, without, however, revealing the secret reason for her insistence.
- At least tell me why you won't be coming with me today," she cried, "I can't explain this whim of yours. Are you ill?
- No," replied Alberte, who continued to draw with the utmost composure, "I never use any pretext, however convenient.
- Give me a reason, then.
- I've got two.
- Let's see.
- Firstly, I'm afraid my Aunt de Châteaugrand is coming back today.
- Is that all? I'll send John to the hotel with my card and a note telling Madame de Châteaugrand that we'll be passing through the Hotel du Louvre on our way back from the woods.
Alberte held out her hand to her sister and said:
- Thank you, Madeleine, but she made no move to get up.
- I've done what you want, so get dressed quickly.
- You're forgetting that I have another reason.
- What other reason? If it's as good as the other!
- You can't do anything about this one.
- Come on, say it quickly.
Alberte put down her pencil and, looking up at her sister, said gravely:
- I don't want to go to the woods in the same carriage as Madame de Lextreville.
Madame de Valroux blushed up to her temples and backed up abruptly to the door as if to leave; then, regaining some control over herself, she replied in a voice full of irritation:
- That's where the absurd gossip of our dowagers is leading you.
- Madeleine!
- Certainly. I've never seen gossip like that in certain salons reputed to be worthy of serving as a refuge for all virtues. Your credulity irritates me, Alberte.
- And I your audacity, Madeleine. You make friends with people without knowing them at all: reputation is a precious commodity, though.
Madame de Valroux smiled mockingly.
- Our aunt de la Rochefaucon left you something other than her jewels," she said.
- There are no two ways about certain things, Madeleine, and I took everything from the de la Rochefaucon inheritance, even the embarrassing things.
- Keep them. As far as I'm concerned, I'm fine with modern freedoms, and besides, I'm quite free to receive the wife of Baron de Lextreville. This old man was a friend of my father.
"But we are wasting time in idle discussions. We have never got on and we never will.
"Are you coming to the wood? I assure you that if I didn't have a particular reason for making you come with me today, I would have already left.
- And what was that reason?" asked Alberte.
- I wanted to give you a surprise, and a very pleasant one. Do you remember that Indian family that the Duchess de la Rochefaucon called the Montézuma?
- Yes, I do!" replied Alberte in a deep voice, "my little neighbours and I were very fond of each other.
- Well, they're in Paris, and the girl with the strange name...
- Luna," interrupted Alberte.
- Perhaps; the girl is very keen to meet you. But you know, you've given yourself such a reputation that anyone who isn't well known, very well known, introduced, very introduced, doesn't dare approach you.
"Will you treat your Indian with the same casualness as that poor Baroness de Lextreville?
- I don't know what's become of Luna," replied Alberte, mechanically arranging her pencils on her easel; "but a first visit doesn't mean anything, and I'd be happy to see her again.
- So you're coming with us?
Alberte thought for a moment and replied:
- If Médéric is on board.
- Ah! You need Médéric?
- Yes, I do. I don't want it said that Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon is walking alone in the woods with Madame de Lextreville.
- But what about me?
- Oh, you don't count. You are known to be light-hearted and inconsistent; but that is accepted.
Madame de Valroux curtsied.
- Thank you for the compliment," she said.
She turned away towards the opening door.
- Agnes," she said, "go and tell your father that Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon wants him to accompany her to the wood.
A pretty child's head, wearing a hat edged with grebe, stretched out behind the door and a cheerful voice called out: Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon, get ready while I go and do your errand, because the horses are cold.
Alberte got up and, to Madame de Valroux's great delight, went over to a mirror cabinet which she opened.
- I'm going to see if everything's ready," said the young woman; "yesterday our heaters were barely warm for a cold of I don't know how many degrees.
And she disappeared.
Alberte quickly got ready to go out.
She was putting a velvet capote over her thick, ingenuous headbands when the door opened in front of little Agnès, who was leading a man of about forty, whose large, waving sideburns were a mixture of blond and grey, and whose tall, slim waist was stooping before the weather.
- Alberte, I don't understand at all what Agnès is telling me," he said, half laughing, half angry. She's making me miss a superb photographic print by entering the darkroom against my will.
- Médéric, if I'd known you were busy with your photographs, I wouldn't have asked you to come with me," replied the young girl. Madeleine absolutely wants me to go to the woods today.
- And since when have you needed me for skating?
Alberte approached him.
- Madame de Lextreville is coming with us," she said, "and, especially for the first time, I very much want you to be there.
M. de Valroux raised his white hands, stained with collodion, to the sky.
- Nonsense," he said; "Madeleine promised to keep to private visits; but Madeleine has never been able to keep her word. By Jove, if this company doesn't suit you, don't go to the woods today.
- I want to go today.
- You're so keen to skate!
- It's not just to skate, I have to meet a childhood friend.
- There's a difference. Well, I want Madeleine to leave out her Baroness de Lextreville. I'll talk to her about it and rid you of some awkward company.
He left quickly, and Alberte waited, putting everything back in order on her easel.
Suddenly she heard Agnès' clear little voice calling her. She came out of her flat and saw Madame de Valroux coming down the stairs on her husband's arm, dressed for a walk.
Alberte smiled. She was used to these volte-faces from an over-indulgent husband, but this one had been executed so quickly that M. de Valroux, offering his hand to his sister-in-law to get into the carriage, said to her in a low voice:
- Thanks to you, I'll be on duty every time Madame de Lextreville has to be put through her paces, so it won't be long now.
A second smile was Alberte's reply, and the carriage drove towards the boulevard Saint-Germain, crowded with the snowy black pyramids that adorned the streets of Paris in that interminable and terrible winter of 1880.
When the carriage stopped in front of the superb new house where Baron de Lextreville lived on the first floor, Madame de Valroux saw a coupé standing in front of the carriage entrance. Through the window was the sickly, bored face of an old man, wrapped in blankets up to his eyes.
On an order given from inside, the coupé curved round to the right of the carriage. The window of the latter lowered under the hand of Madame de Valroux at the same time as that of the coupé under that of Madame de Lextreville, and the two young women leaned towards each other.
- Madame, pardon me," said the Baroness; "but he absolutely wants to accompany me to the lake.
And she stifled a nasty burst of laughter in her sable muff.
- So we go our separate ways?
- If you like, but promise to wait for me when we get there.
Madame de Valroux replied with a nod of understanding, the two mirrors fell away and the two carriages set off at different speeds towards the woods.
The Marquis de Valroux's fiery horses soon overtook the Baron de Lextreville's big brown bay mare.
Excited by the cold breeze entering their nostrils, they flew across the hard-packed snow, crossing paths with rare crews and sledges that passers-by followed with curious eyes.
Beyond the Arc de Triomphe, vulgar vehicles became very rare and, at the junction of the lanes leading to the distinct parts of the lake, only elegant crews could be seen lining up on the beautiful snowy road leading to the part reserved for the aristocratic skaters. There, at least, there was no intrusion possible. The few foreigners who had been allowed to skate in this reserved area had provided sufficient references, and, for all her lightness of spirit, the Marquise de Valroux was beginning to wonder what she would have made of Madame de Lextreville if it had not pleased her old husband to follow her, despite the rigours of the cold.
- I urge you to keep your intimacy with Madame de Lextreville to a minimum," her husband had told her when the two carriages had parted, speaking softly to his wife so that Alberte and Agnès would not understand his words.
Madame de Valroux protested, whispering so loudly that Alberte understood everything she said; but M. de Valroux stood firm and declared that he would not allow Alberte to be seen with her in public places.
- For today she won't be in your way," replied Madame de Valroux tartly, "since she'll have her husband and her carriage.
- That's a good thing! Don't forget to tell her that she can't leave either of them.
- She has enough tact to know how to behave, Médéric, and I find your severity very peculiar. There are women in our society who have caused more scandal than poor Madame de Lextreville.
- Our society is no prouder of her. It's bad enough that we have to put up with the follies of our own kind without having to put up with those of a foreign woman, who doubles as a schemer.
- Oh, look, Madeleine, what a charming outfit," exclaimed Alberte, who was trying to draw Agnes' attention away from the room during this imprudent conversation.
The couple leaned forward to get a better look.
- It's my nabob," exclaimed Madame de Valroux, forgetting all caution. What a marvellous crew!
The sleigh arriving by a side alley was indeed as original as it was charming.
A magnificent grey horse pulled it along to the clear sound of the bells in its carriage, and it was elegantly driven by a young man whose black eyes sparkled under the tawny fur of his hat.
On the second seat were two women, wrapped up to the chin and carefully veiled.
Quick as a flash, he glided past the carriage and disappeared in a cloud of crumbly snow.
- This is the prettiest sleigh in Paris," said Madame de Valroux, who had rolled down her window to watch it go by.
"See how it goes, Médéric!
"Next year, if it snows, you can buy me a sleigh. It's ridiculous to cross this beautiful Siberian landscape in a vulgar car.
- We'll see about that next year," replied M. de Valroux with a significant nod. These are dear whims of mine.
- Daddy, it's going to snow next year, isn't it?" exclaimed Agnès, who spent her time wiping the window with her fur-lined gloves to look out.
- It certainly breaks the monotony of winter," said Madame de Valroux.
And she added, curling up in her furs:
- If the streets were clean enough so that you didn't have to worry about breaking your horse's legs on the way to the theatre in the evening, I'd be perfectly happy to put up with this Siberian cold for three months.
- And so could I!" said Agnes cheerfully; "and you too, Aunt Alberte.
"You don't say anything; don't you love the snow?
- I find it admirably beautiful, especially here," replied Alberte seriously; "there's an enchantingly pretty clump of trees over there.
"Further on, it looks like a quarry of marble blocks; it's solidified snow. Near us, the shrubs are made of spun glass; it's as delightful as it is fragile.
- And on that tree, look at those chunks of snow, Auntie, they look like big angora cats crouching between the branches. And this great white lawn, and these fir trees so black, because some of them have shaken off the snow. I don't know what country I'm in any more. I've never seen so much snow, so much ice. I wish it were like this every winter.
- It would be often, Agnès," replied Alberte, "and not everyone would agree with you.
- Yes, I assure you; you see how many skaters there are.
- That's not everyone. You never think about anything but the happy people, Agnès. I like this shiny snow too, this biting cold pleases me very much; but it makes the poor suffer horribly, and there are so many poor people in Paris!
- There's Alberte!" said Madame de Valroux with a slight shrug, looking at her husband. Speaking of snow, she's come to talk to you about the poor.
Alberte was about to reply, but suddenly the carriage stopped and they arrived in front of the pigeon shooting.
Between the two elegant snow-roofed dovecotes, a rope was stretched with red flags fluttering against it. Beyond them glittered a sheet of ice covered with skaters.
Agnès couldn't understand why her mother took so long to enter the reserved area.
- Médéric, go with your daughter," said Madame de Valroux suddenly; "I think it's polite to wait for Madame de Lextreville, who may want to get out of the carriage. Alberte, you can follow your brother-in-law. I'm not burdening anyone with the chores I've imposed on myself.
Alberte didn't have to say it twice. She took Agnès in one hand, put the other under Mr de Valroux's arm, and after being recognised, they entered the reserved area.
It only took a moment to strap skates on their feet, and soon Alberte and Agnès were dashing across the shiny surface with folded hands, describing the most graceful curves.
Alberte had raised her veil and was devoting herself entirely to her gymnastic pleasure.
Suddenly Agnès stopped her in her tracks.
- Look at Mr de Lextreville," she said, "he scares me.
Alberte looked towards the entrance. Monsieur de Lextreville's coupé was stopped opposite the entrance gate, and behind the glass was the suffering profile of the old husband of Madame de Valroux's new friend.
- Can you see Madame de Lextreville in the coupé?" asked Alberte.
- No, my aunt. There she is, going through the barrier behind Mama.
- We seem to be stopping her... no... she's coming in. Let's go, Auntie; let's put on our best face now, in honour of Mum's entrance.
- We'd better go and say hello to Madame de Lextreville," replied Alberte. A little rest will do us good.
And she led the little girl towards the place where they could get rid of their skates for a moment and come and meet Madame de Valroux and Madame de Lextreville.
The ladies were seated under a straw hut, a shelter prepared for the public and also for tired skaters. A brazier, placed within their reach, was sending them beneficial puffs of heat.
- Madame," said Madame de Lextreville suddenly, "let's seize the opportunity. Here is my Spanish girl who has brought me her friends Louzéma.
- That's right," replied Madame de Valroux, carelessly letting the bearskin from the guardhouse, which she had pulled up to her knees, fall to her feet. What elegant clothes!
"It was he who drove the pretty sleigh that overtook us. I also saw him while I was waiting for you. He was watching Alberte skate.
"An Indian! That's very funny.
- Five hundred thousand francs!" murmured Madame de Lextreville.
- Happy mortal!" sighed Madame de Valroux.
And she added:
- The girl is very pretty; if I had a brother, I'd have him marry her on the spot.
She said no more, for the Spanish lady had just shaken hands with Madame de Lextreville and introduced her to David and Luna, whose eyes sparkled and whose extraordinarily slim and supple waist was encased in a garment of great richness.
After a few words were exchanged, Madame de Lextreville introduced the two young people to Madame de Valroux, who lavished them with her kindest smiles and was quick to recall the memories of the season during which they had met her sister.
- Alberte will be delighted to see you again, mademoiselle," she said to Luna.
- Oh, I'd love to kiss her," exclaimed the ardent young woman. Ever since my brother told me about her, I've been dreaming about her every night. Has she arrived? Is she here?
- Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon has been skating for half an hour," said David.
- And you didn't tell me, David! That's just spiteful!
- I wanted to save you from a fall, Luna. But you didn't waste any time waiting. Here she is now.
Alberte did indeed arrive, Agnès on her arm.
Luna ran towards her. The two names were heard:
- Alberte -- Luna.
Then the two girls embraced effusively.
- Madam, if I may," cried Luna. David, come here!
"Alberte, this is my brother, do you recognise him?
David bowed to Alberte, who held out her hand and smiled.
- My rose buyer.
- So pleased to have met you, mademoiselle.
- Have we aged since Cannes!" exclaimed Luna cheerfully. Perhaps I wouldn't have recognised the little duchess.
- I would have recognised Luna," replied Alberte, gazing at her.
At that moment, M. de Valroux arrived to ask why Alberte and her daughter had stopped skating.
Madame de Valroux resumed her introductions from the back of her gatehouse; then Luna dragged Alberte along and soon they were both seen gliding across the ice in the most beautiful contrast in the world.
- These are really two charming women, each in her own way," said Madame de Lextreville, who was following them with her eyes.
- Your sister is ravishing, sir," added the Marquise de Valroux, addressing David, who had stayed beside her.
- She has all the grace of the women of our country," he replied.
The conversation continued mainly between David and the Marquise de Valroux, who was lavish with kind words.
Monsieur de Valroux, who was amusing himself by dragging his daughter across the ice in a small wheelchair, was the first to return to the ladies.
- You must be fed up," he said to his wife. "Aren't you cold in that cabin?
- I'm fine here, skate to your heart's content," she replied.
- Alberte told me she wanted to come home; here she is again.
- Why is she coming back?
- She'll tell you herself.
Alberte and Luna returned, leaning on each other's arms.
- Do you want to leave?" said Madame de Valroux.
Alberte pulled a small gold watch from her belt.
- It's four o'clock," she replied.
- Well, we have dinner at seven. You can stay for another hour.
- What about our visit to my aunt de Châteaugrand?
- That's for another day.
- I want to see her today, and I've sent for her.
- And the horses! I hear they slip horribly in the Rue de Rivoli.
Alberte looked upset.
- Is that true, Médéric?" she asked.
- I've absolutely no idea.
- Papa," cried Agnès in a clear voice, "this is my Uncle Roger.
M. de Valroux turned away and saw the young dragoon officer in a state of undress.
- Perfect," said Madame de Valroux as she sank back into the guardhouse; "you can send him your regrets.
"As far as I'm concerned, I haven't got time to go to the Hôtel du Louvre this evening.
- We'll tell Roger," replied M. de Valroux, walking to meet the young man.
They came back together, chatting, and Roger, after greeting and shaking hands with Alberte and his sister, who offered him two fingers with great reluctance, asked if the ladies were going skating.
- I was getting ready to leave, Roger," said Alberte, "I was hoping to go and see my aunt this evening, but I hear that the Rue de Rivoli is very slippery.
- No more so than any other street in Paris, my cousin.
- Shall we go?" asked Alberte, looking at her sister.
- It's too late," she replied; "my aunt is dining very early.
- At six o'clock," said Roger.
- We'll arrive in the middle of her dinner," remarked Madame de Valroux again.
- Then it'll be tomorrow," replied Alberte with a regretful sigh.
"Roger, I'm going to surprise my aunt tomorrow morning.
"Please tell her.
- I'll tell her, Alberte. Your visit will give her all the more pleasure, as she is alone every morning, my duty obliging me to leave her at seven o'clock.
- Are you leaving?" asked Madame de Lextreville when she saw Madame de Valroux rise.
- Yes, Médéric is quite right, the cold is becoming bitter.
- Come on," replied Madame de Lextreville.
And she added with a mischievous smile:
- I think Monsieur de Lextreville will have had enough of skating and will be cured of his desire to accompany me.
They greeted each other, Luna and Alberte made arrangements to meet again, and set off together towards the finishing gate.
Roger de Châteaugrand followed them and offered the ladies his hand to get into the carriage.
As Madame de Valroux settled into the carriage, he leaned towards Alberte.
- Who is this young man who was chatting so familiarly with your sister just now?
- He's a stranger, a childhood friend," she replied embarrassed.
- My cousin, please accompany Madame de Lextreville to her coupé," said Madame de Valroux's piercing voice.
But Roger was so reluctant to do so that M. de Valroux had to offer his arm to Madame de Lextreville, who went away with a baleful glance at the young officer.
Mr de Valroux returned grumbling. He had found M. de Lextreville half-frozen, and he said that he hoped this expedition was the last with this woman, whom he did not intend to admit into his intimate society.
Madame de Valroux listened impatiently to his little speech and replied bitterly:
- Let's leave that, I'll do what suits me.
And turning to Alberte, she added:
- Tell me about your foreigners, Alberte, they are charming!
IV -- Intimate life
- Leave me alone with your Châteaugrands, Médéric; I'm telling you that Alberte would be doing the greatest folly in the world if she married Roger. She is very fashionable at the moment, and if I could tell you everything, you would agree with me that she would be very wrong to allow herself to be indoctrinated by Madame de Châteaugrand.
- Another mystery, Madeleine. If you want to convert me to your ideas, the best thing would be to speak to me frankly and clearly.
- The truth is, I can't," said Madame de Valroux, sitting down in front of the little table where her first breakfast had been placed. The secret is not yet mine.
Monsieur de Valroux smiled ironically and exclaimed:
- If it's a secret, it's in good hands.
- But of course," said Madame de Valroux, swirling her little gilt spoon in the scented chocolate, "you don't know it yet, so I've been able to keep it.
- Oh, I'm the confidant of the eleventh hour. Honestly, Madeleine, how many people have you already told this wonderful secret to?
- To no one, Médéric, to no one yet, I swear it.
Monsieur de Valroux laughed; then he added:
- You don't want me to suggest to Alberte that she should go to the Hôtel du Louvre, do you?
- No, of course not. It's not up to you to throw her into the arms of the Châteaugrands. Besides, it's too cold for her to go out in an open carriage.
- That's it, you've invented the most admirable excuse. On that note, I'm off. If Alberte wants to go out, she'll have the coupé hitched up.
Monsieur de Valroux waved goodbye to his wife, took his hat and left.
He crossed the wide corridor, knocked on a door and entered a vast room surrounded by glass cabinets full of books.
In the middle was a square table covered with a green carpet; on it were inkwells, books and paper. Around it were three people: a young girl dressed in that tasteless elegance typical of Parisian women from the suburbs, and two children.
Agnès was writing with a learned air; a little boy, younger than her, had made a pillow out of her books and notebooks.
- Well, Maurice, is this how you take your lessons?" said M. de Valroux, after courteously greeting the young teacher who had stood up when he entered.
And he went to pick up Maurice, whose face was as graceful as it was bored, by his curly little toupee.
- Mr Maurice doesn't want to do anything this morning," said the young girl.
- It's always like that when my Aunt Alberte isn't in the library," said Agnes, to whom Alberte had finally inspired a certain taste for study.
- And why isn't she here this morning?
- She told me she had to go out.
- But I don't think so," replied Monsieur de Valroux. Maurice, take your place," he added, raising his voice.
Having said that, he kissed his children, greeted the mistress and left.
He hadn't closed the door when Maurice threw his penholder at the ceiling.
- I'm going to fetch my aunt," cried Agnès.
- No, no," cried the little boy.
But Agnes was very determined.
She soon finished jumping off her stool and escaping before Maurice could block her way to the door.
She arrived panting in Alberte's room, where she was standing in her dressing gown watching the snow fall.
- Auntie, come into the library quickly," cried Agnès, "Maurice is being very naughty this morning and he's responding very badly to Mademoiselle Adèle.
- You must tell your mother, Agnès," replied Alberte.
- Mummy will give him some chocolate praline, Auntie, and he'll be even naughtier.
- I'm going out with your father.
- Dad went out on his own.
- But I sent for him.
- Listen," said Agnès, "Dad is whistling at his horse.
Alberte turned sharply towards the window.
Monsieur de Valroux, who had brought his English cart up to the gate, had just climbed in, and, taking the reins from his servant, he whistled softly, which was his way of making himself known to his favourite horse.
Alberte quickly put her hand to the espagnolette of the window and opened it; but at the same moment the light carriage moved away.
She closed the window again, shook her head to blow away the sleet that a gust of wind had thrown into her hair, and said to Agnès:
- Go and ask your mother which carriage I should take to go to the Hotel du Louvre.
- I will, Aunt; but if you don't come to the library, Maurice won't do his homework this morning!
- I'm going," said Alberte, "you'll find me there.
They went out. Alberte entered the library and found Maurice galloping along on a ruler.
When Alberte entered, he interrupted his equestrian exercise and, on her command, formulated in a very stern tone, climbed onto his school chair.
So Alberte, without asking for more, sat down beside him and, sometimes caressing him, sometimes speaking sternly to him, got him to start on his copy page.
He was tracing superb capitals on his notebook when Agnès entered the study room. She took no notice of Maurice, who was glaring triumphantly at her, and, approaching her aunt, she said quietly:
- Mum says it's dangerous to take the horses out this morning because of the ice.
And putting both her arms round her aunt's neck, she added, speaking in her ear:
- Mummy is very unhappy about you going to see your aunt at the hotel.
- If I don't go, I won't see her," replied Alberte, concealing the annoyance she felt at Madame de Valroux's disguised refusal. Agnès, if I were away on a trip to the hotel, you'd come and see me, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Aunt, I'd go and see you everywhere. Mum also said it would be more sensible for you to get Maurice to work, as he does nothing when you're away.
- Everything has its time," said Alberte seriously. My aunt is leaving tomorrow, so I don't have to choose when I'm going to visit, as I've already announced it. The weather's fine, I'm going to fetch my old Morin. We'll go as quickly on foot as by car.
"However, I may have to wait for lunch.
- You're very happy to have your old Morin, and to be able to go out whenever you like!
Alberte smiled, kissed the two children in turn, told Mademoiselle Adèle to leave her a written note on how Maurice would finish his lesson, and left the flat.
In the corridor, she stopped for a moment, hesitating. Would she go and tell her sister herself that she had decided to go on foot to visit her aunt at Châteaugrand?
- No," she said with a slightly haughty nod; "I have a duty to fulfil, and I'll do it without hearing any incomprehensible recriminations.
Consequently, she did not go back up the corridor, but followed it to the end. There was the staircase leading to the upper floors.
Alberte climbed it and, on the second floor, took the small back staircase leading to the attic. She rang the bell at a door opening onto the wing with the stables on the ground floor. It was immediately opened by a young woman.
- Oh, Miss, it's you!" said the woman, smiling. Would you believe that my father recognised you when you rang the bell?
- I've come to fetch him, Marie," said Alberte, "if you're not afraid of something happening to him.
- No, no, mademoiselle, my father is still very strong on his legs. He went for a walk with the children yesterday, and the pleasure of driving you would take him out in any weather.
As she said these words, a door opened and a thin, stooped old man, whose venerable head was covered with a profusion of white hair, appeared on the threshold.
- My good Morin, will you walk with me to the Hôtel du Louvre, where my Aunt de Châteaugrand is staying?
The old man saluted respectfully.
- You do me too much honour, mademoiselle. Should I put on my livery?
- No, no, I'm in a hurry. Take a warm overcoat and a walking stick.
The old man disappeared into the back of the flat and came back with his hat in his hand and a strong cane under his arm.
- Are you working for my sister today?" asked Alberte of old Morin's daughter.
- No, mademoiselle; I've got yesterday's ironing to take to the Marquise.
- Well, get there as soon as you can and tell Madame de Valroux that I've left for the Hôtel du Louvre with Morin. She knows that I take him in extreme cases, but today I wondered if he would have dared to go out.
- And why not?" replied the old man, bowing to let her pass and following her with his hat in his hand. It reminds me of the time when I accompanied the little duchess to her catechism lessons at Sainte-Clotilde.
- Oh, how far away those days are! Don't remind me, Morin, it's so sad to grow old!
- Mademoiselle, in the noble de la Rochefaucon family, no one complains about old age.
"Look at Madame la Duchesse! She was eighty-three years old, and she would still be as well off as you and I if she had allowed a fire to burn in her flats on 18 May, the day before she died.
- Did my poor aunt freeze to death, Morin?
- Mademoiselle, as the blood ages, it loses its warmth, and it is necessary to take certain precautions against the cold.
"At the duchess's house, the calorifier and the chimney fires went out together on 1 May.
"It seems that it was customary at court to start and finish fires on regular dates, and the Duchess was very attached to her old habits.
"So when, on the morning of 17 May, I asked her permission to heat the flats, the temperature having suddenly turned icy, I was not well received.
"And when, on the same day, I brought Madame the Duchess her salon heater, she said to me: 'What are you thinking, Morin? I will never allow a fire in my house in the month of May.
And, during the night, she was seized by a sort of apoplexy caused by the cold, and she died the same day, after having received the last sacraments with great devotion.
"And as he said this, the old man sighed deeply.
- She was an energetic woman, my aunt the duchess," said Alberte.
- Yes, too courageous, if you can call it that, and with a heart!
"I had earned enough to live on in her service, and all I had to do was end my days in peace. But I did not yet know the full extent of my mistress's generosity. When the notary read out her will to me, in which she said: "I wish the flats in the left wing to be given as a life annuity to my faithful Morin, so that he may die in this house where he has lavished his good services on me", I cried like a child, mademoiselle.
- I believe you, Morin," said Alberte, who was slowly going down the two flights of stairs, listening attentively to what the old servant was saying.
When she reached the door that served the hotel on this side, she asked the old man to come and help her, and they went out into the street.
Once outside, all conversation ceased. Morin, leaning on his cane with his right hand, held Alberte's umbrella open with his left to protect her from the snow, which was falling capriciously in rare, fine flakes.
Alberte walked lightly beside him, her hands buried in her muff.
A thin layer of snow on the asphalt made walking much easier than one might have expected, and it took them no more than three quarters of an hour to reach the Hôtel du Louvre.
Alberte, taking her information at the office, guessed without difficulty that Roger had counted on her keeping his promise, for no sooner had she uttered the name of the Countess de Châteaugrand than a servant was ordered to take her to the flat occupied by Roger's mother.
She went up to the second floor, preceded by the servant and followed, at the prescribed distance, by Morin, who straightened his bent waist and occasionally resumed the impeccably correct attire he had acquired in the service of the la Rochefaucons.
The servant stopped in front of the double door bearing number 85 and knocked.
A faint female voice answered:
- Come in.
Morin waved the servant aside and opened the door. Alberte entered and threw herself into the arms of a woman with a pale, gentle face who, after embracing her effusively, took her gloved hand in her white one with the gesture of a mother leading her child.
- My good Morin," she said to Alberte's driver, "come in and sit down in this little salon. I'll take my niece to my room.
And she led Alberte into a bedroom and sat her down on the sofa between two windows.
She sat down beside her and used her delicate hands to untie the fire-coloured ribbons that tied her hat to her opulent hair.
Then, looking at her with eyes that were all tenderness and melancholy :
- How long it's been since I've seen you," she said, "how long it's been!
- My aunt, why don't you ever come to Paris?
Madame de Châteaugrand passed her ivory hand over her beautiful forehead.
- The noise of Paris tires me," she said. And it was in Paris that a famous doctor told me: 'Your son is lost, madame, it would take a miracle to save him. Take him to Cannes, but don't expect anything.
"When I left that house with that dreadful secret in my heart, leaning on my poor child's arm and devouring my tears, when I felt myself mingling with that indifferent and cruel crowd, I loathed Paris.
- Dear Aunt," said Alberte, her voice trembling with emotion, "will you never find consolation?
- Never, Alberte; I'll never get used to this absence.
"Life is not long enough to console oneself for such sorrows. Fortunately it passes quickly! I can see the time for the meeting approaching.
"But what's the point of burdening you with my sadness? It's not my place. However, they are linked to the scruples that suddenly seized me about you.
"If I have come to Paris in this harsh season, it is to confide in you, my dear Alberte.
- To me, Aunt?
- To you. I said to myself: Alberte lives in joy, in the most refined worldly pleasures; Alberte is no longer the child who blindly sympathised with my grief; Alberte has a radiant youth, if not on the side of the heart, at least on the side of success, sympathy and admiration. Who knows if Alberte's delays and hesitations are not due to the thought of giving herself an incurably melancholy mother-in-law! Who knows if the fear of living for a season at Châteaugrand with this poor woman who wears the mourning of her heart on her clothes does not get in the way of the sympathy she feels for her son! Wouldn't I, with my eternal regrets, be an obstacle to the happiness of my dear Roger?
"That's the question I've been asking myself for the last two months.
Alberte leaned towards her and tenderly kissed her white hair.
- If there were any motive powerful enough to make me marry Roger straight away, it would be to give me a mother like you," she said.
- Are you telling the truth, my dear Alberte? Don't those around you point out the boredom of living with the sad Countess of Châteaugrand?
Alberte shook her head.
- My entourage thinks and says what it wants," she exclaimed, "but I don't listen to its reasons when they are childish or false.
Madame de Châteaugrand drew a long breath.
- You are relieving me of a great burden, Alberte, I know that you cannot tell a lie.
"The thought that I had something to do with your procrastination made me suffer a great deal.
"And now, my child, be sincere to the end. Why did you put off giving your final answer for six months? Why did you put off my son's happiness for six months?
Madame de Châteaugrand's voice had become as penetrating as her gaze.
Alberte lowered her head without answering.
- My child," continued Madame de Châteaugrand, "you mustn't play with the heart of a man like Roger. He loves you deeply, unconditionally. You will not find in anyone else a purer life, a higher intelligence, a more upright heart. Is it the difference in fortune that influences you? You lead a luxurious life, and the power of money is no longer unknown to you.
Alberte made a negative gesture.
- Is it your health?
Alberte paled slightly and said softly:
- Some people put it first, Auntie.
Madame de Châteaugrand's face flushed with pain, but she resumed with great energy:
- Alberte, those people are wrong. I knew better than anyone the temperament of my two children.
"Like me, Jean was in delicate health. He wasn't a heart patient, but he was a delicate person whose patriotism killed him.
She looked up and continued in her slow, soft voice:
- What I say is true. Only God and his mother know the heroic imprudences he committed in that fatal war.
"If he had stopped in time, if he had let himself be sent out of the army by the major who begged me to call him back, he would still be alive.
"But no, in this delicate body there was a strong soul.
"When he left, he said to me, without being obliged to do so: "I love France enough to sacrifice myself for her.
"And he did! And he was one of the bravest, and he fought everywhere, and he was wounded in a swamp for two days and two nights. So when he came back, having used up all his energy, there was no hope left.
She clasped her hands together and added:
- That's how much we love our country!
- It's admirable!" murmured Alberte.
- At last, may God reward us for our bitter sacrifices!
"Now back to the question of health.
"I told you, Jean looked like me. In Roger's veins, on the other hand, flows the generous blood of the Châteaugrands.
"He was born vigorous. The profession of arms that killed his brother increased his physical strength tenfold.
"You see, Alberte, I ardently desire my Roger's happiness, and I know that he would find it in the union he dreams of; but I have known you too long, I love you too much, to sacrifice you, even to my own son.
"If the dreaded scourge that took John from me were hereditary in my family, and if Roger had the slightest predisposition to it, I would have warned you. I tell you before God, and according to the testimony of the most learned men, it is not.
"Oh, how serious this question is!
"You don't know what martyrdom I would be exposing you to if it were otherwise. Nothing poisons life like this horrible disease. It waits until its victims are in the prime of life, and lets them live to be twenty.
"I don't think there is a destiny comparable to that of a mother who sees this germ of death slowly developing in her child.
"The illness only appears at intervals, the attacks are short-lived, and health appears to return.
"Then, all of a sudden, the languor, the coughing, the morbid symptoms reappear.
"Oh, what a slow, awful martyrdom!
"And they're so sweet, these children who have to die at twenty, they're so endearing! You knew Jean; I don't need to tell you any more (1) .
- My aunt," said Alberte, "I understand you, and I can assure you that what you have just told me completely destroys the obstacle that several of my relatives, including the canoness of Bonlieu, who is a doctor in petticoats, raised against my marriage to Roger.
- You have saved me a great deal of worry. I didn't want to write these things to you, but I thought that you are old enough to hear them and that you are too helpless in front of your relatives, who are hostile to us, thanks to your sister Madeleine. I can't understand why you resist.
"As compensation for a less considerable fortune, Roger had a great military future ahead of him. He graduated second from Saint-Cyr and was one of the first to enter the École de guerre.
"His superiority is so obvious that his chiefs, who are the most hostile to his religious and political opinions, would not dare, would not want (they still have enough patriotism for that), to put a stop to a career that offers the best hopes.
- It's nothing in Madeleine's eyes," said Alberte; "she no longer loves the army since its defeats; but I don't need to tell you that, when the time comes, I won't take her advice.
"And do you want me to give you proof of my independence from my sister? If you like, I will spend the month of February with you at Châteaugrand.
- My dear child, your heart inspires you delightfully; but won't that be very harsh? Won't a whole month in the country at this time of year, alone with a sad woman, frighten you?
"At this very moment, everything will be fun and festivities for you in Paris.
- Aunt, my heart is not so much in love with pleasure that I don't know how to sacrifice anything for it," replied Alberte, whose brow darkened. I know that this winter there will be a lot of fun to be had in our world, but I find the time very ill-chosen.
She stood up and, placing her hand on her aunt's shoulder, added in a serious tone:
- I too am French in heart and soul, and I sometimes suffer when I see myself laughing and dancing in the midst of the humiliations of my homeland.
Madame de Châteaugrand rose in her turn to embrace him.
- Oh, you," she said, "you are worthy in every way of being my son's wife.
"Will you really come to Châteaugrand? Or are you making me this generous promise only to soften the blow your delay has caused me?
- I'm serious, Aunt," said Alberte.
And she added with a smile:
- You will see that this step will compromise me completely.
- These words will be a balm to Roger's heart," said Madame de Châteaugrand.
- Certainly, Aunt, and also that I will no longer shrink from making a decision. I'm barely of age, as you know, and the partition is not yet complete.
It's a perpetual contradiction; she always has I don't know how many suitors to offer me; it's getting tiresome.
With these words, she kissed Madame de Châteaugrand for the last time, her gentle face reflecting deep joy, and they both went into the small salon where Morin was waiting for them, upright and uncovered.
- One of these days you'll bring her back to me, my good Morin," said Madame de Châteaugrand; "this little walk is very healthy, and Alberte wouldn't like to keep the coachmen waiting too long in this Siberian cold.
And she added, leaning into the young girl's ear:
- See you soon, won't I? I'm leaving at the beginning of next week.
Alberte replied with a gesture of intelligence, and they parted.
V -- The transvestite ball
The courtyard of the old Hôtel de la Rochefaucon was filled with brilliant crews. An elegant crowd rushed in through the middle door, which was only opened on solemn occasions, and on the pediment of which was carved the coat of arms bearing: Gules, a natural falcon chaperoned Azure, resting on a rock Sable, and surmounted by the baron's tortilla which had preceded the ducal crown in the mists of time.
The grandiose vestibule was transformed into a cloakroom, and the women, stripped of their ballgowns, appeared in the most fanciful costumes. These Italian, Swiss, Scottish, Egyptian and Transterranean women climbed the beautiful granite staircase with its iron banister, which they had the good taste not to disguise, on the arms of their escorts, who were dressed in the same way.
- David," said a charming young girl whose sumptuous costume of purple silk sari, gold scarf and gold-embroidered trousers had been borrowed from the Far East, "this wild staircase is superb in the light; don't you think so?
- Yes, Luna," replied the young rajah, whose pearl-embroidered suit and trousers, silk scarf glittering with emeralds, and turban whose golden sirphey shone under the light of a superb diamond, suited him better than the European suit and hat. There's a luxury here that I like.
Luna leaned towards him.
- Here we are in the noble suburb," she said; "poor Carmen is sorry for our happiness.
David, who was conveniently arranging his tarwar on his belt, the handle of which was studded with precious stones and which was dipped into a rhinoceros skin sheath, smiled proudly.
- It can be," he said, "you don't give parties the cachet of this one with money.
- But, David, we could build an old hotel with an old stone staircase and an iron banister adorned with fleurs-de-lis.
David nodded.
- Maybe," he said, "but all the gold in the world wouldn't give us the past that gives these old walls their grandeur.
At that moment they reached the landing, and Luna eagerly left her brother's arm to take the one presented to her by Monsieur de Valroux at the door of the first salon.
- Oh sir," she said, "who is that young girl who has just left you, dressed as a Greek? She is a dream of beauty.
- It's Mademoiselle Marie-Antoinette de la Rochefaucon, daughter of the Duke Enguerrand de la Rochefaucon.
- She's a marvel!" said Luna.
And she entered the salon with a smile on her face, preceded by the beautiful young woman whose name she had just asked. With wide eyes full of admiring curiosity, she walked through the splendid salons, which had been furnished under Louis XIII and which had been preserved from the ravages of time and revolution.
- Madame," she said, curtseying to the Marquise de Valroux, disguised as a Venetian, who was receiving her guests while chatting with an elderly lady, dressed in purple satin, whom she called my aunt, "it seems to me that I am seeing France for the first time.
The Marquise responded to this delicate compliment with a cordial handshake, and turning to David, who was bowing before her, she said:
- I have given Alberte your commission, sir, and you are entered for the first waltz.
David gave her an eloquent look of thanks and turned round to hear his sister exclaim:
- Ah, dear Alberte, what beautiful ancestors you have!
Alberte, dressed as a medieval chatelaine, raised her blue eyes to the line of portraits set in the white woodwork, and replied gracefully:
- Beauty is timeless, Luna. Have you ever been painted in this ravishing costume or in a ball gown?
- No, never. We're painted now with our unsightly sheaths; it's very vulgar. David, you will have me painted in gala costume, by a real painter, won't you?
- With all my heart," replied David; "tomorrow I'm going to look for the artist.
With that, Alberte introduced Luna to her aunt, the canoness of Bonlieu, the lady in the purple satin, then she put her arm under hers and led her to the place she had assigned to her next to a young woman who was a stranger herself and very willing to welcome Mademoiselle Louzéma.
- These girls make a pleasant contrast," said the lady in the purple satin. The foreigner has an admirable costume. She is also very pretty, and the strangeness of her dress only enhances the elegant simplicity of Alberte's.
Your sister is the last of our young ladies who is faithful to simplicity; but it must also be said that she can bear it.
"But tell me again, Madeleine, the names of that little yellow gentleman and his sister.
"What are they? Chinese, Andalusians, Mohicans?
- They're from India," replied Madame de Valroux, "you can tell by their costumes, which have no equal in Paris.
- What caste are they?
- The highest, my aunt. In any case, very rich.
- This little man seems very attentive to Alberte.
"Isn't this the mysterious suitor you want to replace Roger de Châteaugrand?
Madame de Valroux did not answer immediately; she was holding out her fingertips to a young Bohemian woman being led by her husband dressed in the majestic costume of a doge. When this was done, she greeted the men accompanying this elegant couple and, answering the canoness of Bonlieu in a half-voice:
- Shh!" she said, "keep my secret, Aunt; it's him. Madame de Bonlieu quickly placed a magnifying glass on his nose, which fell in a line too straight from his too large forehead, and continued:
- He's ugly; he's a bit of a monkey, but his eyes are superb, and he's got a look that's not for the faint-hearted. And what stones! What diamonds! The large pearl in the handle of this curved sabre is worth, I know, ten thousand francs.
- You don't need these fantasies when you're rich," sighed Madame de Valroux. I can assure you that I wouldn't understand Alberte refusing such a bargain.
- Has he asked for her?
- He doesn't dare; but he has been seeing her several times a week for two months, thanks to his sister whom Alberte has befriended, and you don't have to see very clearly to guess that he is very much in love with her.
Madame de Bonlieu turned her grey eyes towards Madame de Valroux, and her mouth curved in disdain as she replied:
- You speak a little lightly of these things, my niece. Before admitting these strangers into an intimacy such as might lead to a marriage, were you well informed about their origin and their fortune?
- Very well, very fully informed, Aunt. The foreign colony is as well known as French society.
- Our family will not be satisfied with superficial information, I warn you, Madeleine.
- They are free to take what they want. As far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather see Alberte marry David Louzéma, an Indian prince, than Roger de Châteaugrand, a lieutenant in the dragoons.
- Is that little yellow man a prince?
- Yes, or something similar.
- A prince, perhaps, like some counts of Bonapartist manufacture?
- If you want my project to fail, put a lot of pressure on him. Accept Mr David as he is, or say frankly that you prefer Roger de Châteaugrand.
The canoness nodded and smiled.
- No," she said, "I've never liked the Châteaugrands. They are people with a mind of their own.
"As for Roger, he will die a poitrinaire like his brother, and it would be madness to marry him.
- Well, if we don't all go against Alberte, you'll see that she will marry him.
- In spite of us?
- Of course she will.
- Just think...
Madame de Valroux paused again: a whole series of guests had to be received.
When she had given them enough smiles and banal words, she resumed:
- Just imagine that she had arranged to spend February at Châteaugrand with my aunt.
- And Roger, no doubt?
- No, Roger can't leave the École de Guerre, and besides, going to join Alberte would have been totally out of character for him. Nevertheless, if Alberte had spent a winter month at Châteaugrand with Roger's mother, all that was left to do was to publish the banns of marriage.
- And how did you avoid this danger?
- By throwing into Alberte's arms this pretty stranger who is a sort of childhood friend, and whom she does not distrust.
"I became frantically attached to the Louzéma family. Every day we went skating together.
In the evenings we went to the theatre. And then Alberte, who is devout, imagined converting Luna, who is not, and that brought them closer and closer together. So when Monsieur de Châteaugrand asked for Alberte, Mademoiselle Luna cried out.
"She would not be consoled by Alberte's departure, she would leave her religious studies there, and her brother would do the same.
"I have to tell you that this whole world was very pagan and that, at Luna's insistence, David also thought of finding out about religion. He and the suave Mademoiselle Bellinard had talks on the subject.
"During the talks, he had the sense not to say anything, only his sister was involved, and Alberte, who has quite unexpected sensitivities, allowed herself to be persuaded and continued her conferences.
"The affair became closer and closer, and now I wouldn't swear that my rajah hadn't come far enough to push Roger aside momentarily.
"That's all I wanted. We'll see about that later.
- Alberte has only to behave herself," said the canoness with the same smile that revealed small, white teeth that looked like they were made to bite; "they'll end up marrying her off against her will.
"But it seems to me that your husband is calling you, Madeleine. It's likely that someone is making an entrance.
- Come on," said the Marquise de Valroux, rising, "would you like to go for a walk, Aunt?
- No, no, I'm fine here. I would frighten these elegant people. I've never been pretty and little attention has been paid to me; now I'm very old, no one cares about me at all.
"Go, go, my niece, and let me manage as I see fit. I came here just to have a look, just to have a look.
The Marquise de Valroux kept her mouth shut and joined her husband, who was waiting to meet a princely guest whose arrival had been announced and whose presence was expected to open the ball.
At a sign from M. de Valroux, the orchestra, placed in a corner veiled by large draperies, played the first chords, and the couples filed into the large salon, chasing away the few serious men who had gone astray at this party, who went to gather in the salon adjoining the buffet.
The canoness de Bonlieu alone remained bravely at the corner of her large fireplace, watching, listening and filing away in her memory, which was astonishing, a thousand remarks and observations intended to serve as fodder for her little circle, in which she included personalities from outside the de Valroux family.
The Marquise de Valroux had completely forgotten her, when a young musketeer approached her and said:
- Madame, your aunt Madame de Bonlieu wishes a moment's conversation with you, and she has deigned to choose me for this message, which I have taken on all the more willingly as I thought you would do me the honour of accepting my arm to walk through the salons to the boudoir where she awaits you.
The Marquise de Valroux smiled, put her hand on the arm that was offered to her, and went up to her boudoir, separated from the salon by a door that was at that moment raised enough to allow those present to have a look at the ball.
Madame de Bonlieu was alone there at the moment. She thanked the young musketeer, who left after greeting the two ladies warmly.
- My dear, you are abandoning me completely," said the canoness, laughing, "but I can see some very interesting things from here that you will not be sorry to hear about.
"If I had not been greeted by this little Dragonneau, who has very good manners and whose costume reminds me of a certain musketeer of my youth, you would have risked losing the fruit of my observations.
- And I would have lost a lot, Auntie?
- Judge for yourself. Your Indian prince never leaves the vicinity of Alberte. His assiduity is much noticed and much commented on, I can assure you.
- This is what I want. By giving this transvestite ball which allows the Louzéma to show themselves in the most brilliant light.
- Brilliant is not enough, it's gleaming that should be said.
"Their diamonds, rubies and pearls dazzle all those who are capable of being dazzled.
- I was sure of this and, I repeat, it was with this kind of staging in mind that I imagined this transvestite ball.
- It's very ingenious, especially as there is a desperate witness to the Mogul's assiduities in the main salon, who hasn't lost a glance or a gesture.
- Is Roger here?
- He is here, precisely opposite this door opening. There he is, half-hidden by this gilded console. He's wearing a Henri III suit. Can you see him?
- I don't dare look that way again.
- He only has eyes for the nabob dancing with Alberte, and besides, if we can see him very well, he can't see us.
- I can see him. This costume suits him perfectly.
- He really is a charming horseman; just like his father. Ah, his father, he inflicted a humiliation on one of my relatives that she will never forgive him for.
- I always suspected that there was more between you and the Châteaugrands than a difference of character," said Madame de Valroux.
The canoness looked her in the eye.
- Above all, don't go gossiping about it with your foolish women of any nation," she said.
- Not if you want to tell me everything, Aunt; otherwise I'll have to try and guess.
- My God, my dear, that wouldn't be difficult for you, curious and cunning as you are. This secret was a Polichinelle secret for all our contemporaries. Yes, they all know that my sister Geneviève was to marry Jean de Châteaugrand, who, my goodness, was so handsome that he cared nothing for pretty women. In this world contrast is king. So he sought above all wit, while not being disdainful of birth and fortune; and the Bonlieu were not lacking in either. But then, in the midst of talks about Geneviève, he met this languorous and devout countess in a Norman castle and planted her there for her.
"You understand that all the Bonlieu family have kept a grudge against anything directly related to this branch of the Châteaugrand family. And that's why my sister doesn't want to hear about this marriage, and why we will be your faithful allies in preventing this pretty Alberte from getting herself into this hornet's nest. This is a reason of my own. The poor girl should give in to that reason alone.
- I must confess, Aunt, that my cousin Roger does not seem to me to be following in his brother Jean's footsteps.
- I tell you that he will die like him and that it is this fear that makes the Countess de Châteaugrand inconsolable. Besides, what's the point of going on about it? You want your Indian to be a prince, I want Roger de Châteaugrand to have a heart condition, let's put all our excuses in the same bag, they're all the same.
At this point, the two chatters were interrupted by Monsieur de Valroux, who had set off in search of his wife.
- I find your idea of disappearing into this boudoir alone with Madame de Bonlieu inconceivable," he said, offering her his arm. You seem to have forgotten that it is you who are giving this party.
- Médéric, you are so demanding!
- I think I'm entitled to rest for a moment, the ball is not lacking in spirit. There's my Indian prince, dancing again with Alberte. No costume can rival hers.
- It is indeed incomparably rich. But tell me, are you really sure about these foreigners? Everyone notices them and everyone asks who they are.
- They're Indians and fabulously rich, with a wealth that puts them in first place everywhere.
- Well, go and tell that to this curious group who...
He leaned into his wife's ear.
- Who has noticed that your Indian prince is openly courting Alberte.
- And why not?" replied Madame de Valroux; "it seems to me that a man who is five times a millionaire would be a more advantageous match for her than an officer without a fortune.
And with this arrow aimed straight at Roger de Châteaugrand, the first of its force, she walked alone towards the group of friends who were concerned about the name and quality of the brilliant foreigners received ex abrupto in the salons of the noble Hôtel de la Rochefaucon.
Monsieur de Valroux had frowned at this clear statement, but suddenly his brow lifted and he eagerly extended his hand to the blond young man wearing the pourpoint and chef's hat fashionable under Henry III.
- You're very late, my dear Roger," he said.
- I was one of the first to arrive, Médéric," replied Roger de Châteaugrand in a serious tone, "but I didn't want to distract you from your duty as master of the house.
- Have you seen Madeleine?
- I said hello to the Marquise de Valroux but she didn't deign to recognise me.
- Cross-dressing changes people so much," replied Monsieur de Valroux with a hint of embarrassment, "that you should not be surprised. I walked past one of my nieces without recognising her. Did you dance?
- No, I did not. I was hoping to dance with Alberte. When I arrived, she had promised everything. She usually reserved at least one quadrille for me, well aware that military service restricts our freedom too much for us to be able to be exact at every party.
- My dear, as you know, women often vary.
Roger turned suddenly to Monsieur de Valroux, and in a dull voice said:
- Would I have been a fool to trust Alberte, Médéric?
- Oh, I'm not saying that, no, no; but after all, the best young girls have these slight caprices.
- Caprice is the word, for in truth I would never have supposed a rival in this little man, overloaded with jewels, who so often imposes his presence on her.
- My dear," said Monsieur de Valroux, familiarly taking the young man's arm, "you must let this whim pass without paying more attention to it than it deserves. Alberte is very fond of that little mogul's sister, and my wife is crazy about their glitter and the way they throw gold out of windows. To attach too much importance to it would be very clumsy, believe me.
- You're putting a strain on my heart, Médéric. If there is a sister, I can explain her assiduity. Show her to me, please.
- It's that young girl with the sparkling eyes and the gold-embroidered silk suit who has just sat down next to Alberte.
- Ah, I'd already noticed her, but she's so pretty compared to that little man that I couldn't imagine them being so closely related. My mother gave me a letter for Alberte. Would you accompany me to her?
- Let's go," said Monsieur de Valroux, glancing towards the back of the salon where his wife was sitting.
And he added between his teeth:
- Never mind, we'll take turns.
They broke through the crowd, which moved like a living screen in front of the bench where Alberte and Luna had just sat down after a waltz, and while Monsieur de Valroux exchanged a few words with Luna, who was fanning herself with a superb peacock feather fan, Roger de Châteaugrand handed a sealed letter to Alberte, saying:
- My cousin, my mother, assuming that I would have the pleasure of dancing with you this evening, had entrusted me with this message. Forgive me for giving it to you in the middle of a party, but tomorrow I'll probably have left Paris.
- For long, Roger?" asked Alberte, who seemed embarrassed.
The young man gestured to the paper and replied:
- Your reply to this letter will determine the length of my absence.
Having said that, he saluted deeply and walked away with Monsieur de Valroux.
- My dear Roger," continued the latter, "you seem very impressed. Let's not raise tempests out of thin air. There's certainly a chill between you and Alberte. Why have you disappeared since she refused to go to Châteaugrand? She gave you a reason that she believed to be good, and the whole family, led by the Bonlieu family, would have opposed her departure. Don't leave each other hurt, there's no telling where this could lead. Instead, go and offer yourself to Madame de Valroux to lead the cotillion. You excel in this role and I know that, not having you on hand, she was embarrassed.
"No sensitivities on this side either. Madeleine has excellent qualities, but it would be better to fix a weather vane in a winter wind than to fix her preferences. It's not about her.
The cotillion will give you ten opportunities to talk to Alberte. She's proud, and if you get angry over nothing, she'll get angry.
Roger de Châteaugrand smiled wistfully, but replied:
- I'll take your advice and address my request to Madame de Valroux. Will you wait for me a moment?
Monsieur de Valroux nodded in agreement and the young man set off in search of the marquise.
Monsieur de Valroux remained in this part of the salon for several minutes, exchanging words and smiles with the passing groups of guests.
Finally he saw the horseman Henri III coming towards him. He was pale and came up close to his cousin to say:
- It's the Indian who's driving the cotillion. As you can see, all I have to do is leave.
- In truth, she puts him in every sauce," replied Monsieur de Valroux, shrugging his shoulders.
And he shook hands with Roger, who lost himself in the crowd.
The last look the young officer gave Alberte as he passed her by, before leaving the main salon, was snatched up by Luna.
- Alberte," she said with her usual freedom, "what is the name of the young man who gave you a letter and who is one of the most handsome horsemen at this party?
- It's my cousin Roger de Châteaugrand.
- The relative of the Jean we mourned so much at Cannes (1)?
- His brother.
- Well, his visit has made you wonder. Who is this letter from?
- From the Countess de Châteaugrand.
- You are dying to read it, read it.
- Not here," said Alberte, "there are too many nosy people.
- What does it matter?
- But we can go to Madeleine's boudoir, because the truth is, I can't wait to hear what Madame de Châteaugrand has written to me.
They rose and made their way to the small salon where the intimates were to rest from the noise and bustle and talk to each other.
It was empty by a happy chance, and Alberte, approaching the fireplace on which burned two lamps whose pink shades veiled their brilliance, broke the seal of the letter that Roger had given her, and quickly read the following:
"My dear Alberte,
"You must know that we are distressed by everything we learn. I have received the saddest confidences from Roger, who believes his hopes are seriously threatened.
"There is nothing but talk of the assiduity of a rich foreigner whom your sister, with her usual lightness, has received into her intimacy.
"Roger's friends keep him cruelly informed of what is happening at the Hôtel de la Rochefaucon.
"Your walks and meetings are reported to him, and he came to me in despair, ready to be drafted into the army in Algiers. I suffer horribly at the thought of the separation that threatens me. Please write to me. Tell me with the sincerity that my poor child is beginning to suspect, what is true about these rumours.
"We must get out of this impasse. I have forgiven you for your failure to keep your word this winter. Your promise was too generous and you are not always free to act as you wish.
"But we must get out of these poignant uncertainties. My happiness and that of my child are at stake.
"Alas, will this project so tenderly cherished, this future so long prepared, be destroyed?
"I embrace you with all my heart, and once again beg you to answer me with the frankness that is one of your most precious qualities.
"Countess de Châteaugrand".
- Here's an ugly letter that has put a cloud on your forehead," cried Luna, striking the paper with the tip of her fan, "let me make a match out of it.
Alberte shook her head, folded the letter and put it in the cute pocket attached to her blue velvet bodice.
- This letter distresses me indeed," she said, "but I had to expect its contents.
- What is it?" asked Luna with her natural impetuosity.
And she added tenderly:
- Alberte, you know all my secrets, and you keep all yours from me.
Alberte replied with a loving look, but led her wordlessly out of the boudoir.
At the door stood David, who, in his capacity as cotillion conductor, was waiting for Alberte.
- Mademoiselle," he said respectfully, "here's a piece of paper you're in great danger of losing while dancing. Would you entrust it to me?
- Thank you," replied Alberte, blushing slightly, "I'll put it in a safe place.
She opened the pretty steel-lined pouch that hung from her belt and inserted Madame de Châteaugrand's letter.
Then, looking rather coldly at David, whose accent had displeased her when he spoke of the letter, she said:
- Here I am, ready to begin, sir.
VI -- Pros and cons
- Who are you writing to? Alberte.
- To my aunt from Châteaugrand, Madeleine.
Madame de Valroux, who was paying her sister a morning visit in her bathrobe and whose face bore the marks of the previous day's fatigue, looked annoyed.
- Are you replying to the letter Roger gave you last night?
- She said.
- You're not demanding. Has anyone ever handed in letters at a party? He should at least have disguised himself as a postman.
- Roger is going to see his mother who is waiting for my reply.
- It's a good thing he's going to the country to recharge his batteries. The canoness thought he had changed horribly. As far as I'm concerned, I hardly saw him, and it seems he didn't dance. But that's nothing to be surprised about, these Châteaugrands have character!
She paused for a moment and then continued:
- Will you be joining us now?
- My God, where are you off to next?
- To visit Chantilly. Your friends Louzéma don't know Chantilly, it's a horror; and they've heard so much about it that they've decided to go there straight away.
- They'll do it without me," says Alberte.
- What! You're not going to show them Chantilly?
- No, of course not, the ball lasted until two o'clock and this evening we have the Duchess de Craonville's party.
- What does that mean? On Carnival days, we manage to have twice the fun.
- Not me," said Alberte, "I don't have the temperament to put up with so many vigils and so many parties.
- You," exclaimed Madame de Valroux, "it suits you to complain about tiredness, while I put up with it.
Alberte looked at her sister and replied in a slightly ironic tone:
- Ah, Madeleine, your health is in a class of its own. You're only really ill during Lent and in the country, where you get bored.
- Ah, certainly, and I'm surprised to hear you complaining, you who aren't bored anywhere.
- I don't want to do anything excessive.
- And it's the excessive that amuses me.
- Why don't you go to Chantilly?
- This is ridiculous. The Louzéma will get angry.
- Let them be angry.
Madame de Valroux looked fixedly at her sister.
- Are you speaking sincerely?
- You know, Madeleine, that I usually do.
- You don't love your friend more than that?
It was Alberte's turn to look at Madeleine.
- Does affection consist in killing yourself in frivolous things for those you love?
- It consists in following them, not separating from them. I find you revoltingly ungrateful towards Luna and her brother.
- Her brother?" replied Alberte, not without a touch of haughtiness. What obligations do I have towards her brother?
- I don't know! But he's at your feet! But, at your instigation, I have all the equipment and servants at my disposal. You know that you had something to do with their installation on the Champs-Élysées. All you had to do was say that you didn't understand hotel life and he left the Continental.
- Enough," said Alberte, "I know he does enough crazy things like that; but sometimes I'm more annoyed than charmed.
- Why do you think that is?
- Because it seems to commit me. Now, I have the honour of telling you, I still see a difference between Roger de Châteaugrand and David Louzéma.
- It exists, but not in the way you would like to think. You're the only one who thinks that way.
"How can you compare these two men as parties?
"With Roger, you will be, in spite of your birth, only a vulgar officer's wife, following him from garrison to garrison, obliged to see and visit people with whom you would never have thought of mixing, who will be your superiors, and who will be able to do you a thousand injustices without you being able to complain.
"With an army made up like ours, there's no way we can marry officers under the flag, servants of the most ridiculous of governments.
Alberte raised her head sharply.
- Roger only serves France," she said, "and it will always be very noble to serve France.
Madeleine smiled ironically.
- If my aunt from Bonlieu were here, she'd tell you that you're admirably chauvinistic. I'm more down-to-earth and I see things as they are.
"We live in a century of money. Mr David, with his millions and his position, seems to me the most charming of suitors. And here, there is no need to swallow the shame that stigmatises certain misalliances, there is no difference in education, in existence. They are strangers of the highest distinction. Were they dazzling enough last night! Many people who were angry with me about this affair have softened considerably. Different times, different customs. If Mademoiselle Luna wants, tomorrow she'll be a princess.
Alberte made a movement.
- Certainly," continued Madame de Valroux, triumphantly, "the ground was already prepared yesterday for this handsome Italian prince who has only a palace to sell, and who cannot bring himself to make this last sacrifice. There are countless alliances of this kind, even among us. It wouldn't be this one, or that one, who would think you're stepping out of line. Their brothers and sisters have done the same.
"What are our fortunes compared to that of the Louzéma? Drops of water.
Alberte gestured impatiently.
- You're only talking about money," she said; "I know they have plenty, but I'll never marry for interest.
- Mr David is a charming gentleman and he loves you madly.
Alberte blushed slightly and murmured:
- I don't know him.
- You've been seeing him almost every day for two months and you don't know him?
- No," replied Alberte.
She put on a tired expression and added:
- What's the point of talking about these things? They're not as far advanced as you think, and certainly not as far advanced as you'd like. It's no small matter to chain your destiny to that of a stranger.
- How provincial your ideas have remained! You don't seem to have left Château de la Rochefaucon in the Cotentin region. Don't you know that, with the modern facilities for travel, nobody in the world thinks twice about marrying a foreigner who can become a Parisian if he wants to.
- Madeleine," said Alberte in a deep voice, "you don't have a shred of patriotism in your heart.
It was at this moment that the profound difference between the two sisters was immediately apparent.
The austere word patriotism, uttered with such soul from the rosy lips of the twenty-year-old child, did not stir a fibre in the fevered face of the thirty-year-old woman.
- But how old-fashioned you are! Alberte," she said with cold irony, "patriotism is an old word and an old thing. You don't put it in your life as an obstacle any more than you imagine imposing the tirades of Corneille and Racine on nineteenth-century Parisians. It's old-fashioned, rococo, impossible.
"I assure you that you are shrinking every day in devotion as in everything else. You'll end up a canoness at least, if this goes on.
- You don't understand me, Madeleine; so let's leave it at that, and let me write to my aunt de Châteaugrand.
- Have you made up your mind not to come to Chantilly?
- Very decided.
- That's fine, I'll say you've got a migraine.
- But, Madeleine, with all the excuses you take the pleasure of inventing, you're doing me a great disservice.
- I don't understand. I don't understand.
- By gracing me with detestable health. Every time I refuse to go with you, the next day everyone asks about my health, with a particular interest: "What about your migraine, your toothache, your neuralgia? Once and for all, I want you to tell the truth:
"Alberte doesn't want to go out today.
- It will damage your character; do you like that better?
- Do you think that sensible people don't criticise Luna's life of unbridled pleasure?
- Then why don't you preach to her, since you're in the business of converting her?
- I'd be preaching in the desert. She's willing to get up at ten o'clock on Sundays to go to mass; she's willing to pray sometimes, to be lean on Fridays; but staying at home, giving two hours to serious life, impossible.
- But you love her like that?
- With all my heart.
- Well, then...
- But nothing obliges me to live like her; no duty obliges me to follow her wherever she goes.
- God, you're so sensible!" exclaimed Madame de Valroux. Once again, I'm surprised that you don't have the idea of taking the veil.
- If Roger de Châteaugrand had a fortune, and if he didn't come from a family of chestnuts, I'd say to you: Marry him right now and retire from the world.
- There is a middle way between withdrawing from the world and giving it the best of your life, Madeleine.
- Enough, you'd give me a nervous breakdown. Since you spend the day in meditation, you can look after Agnès and Maurice for a while, can't you?
- Of course I can.
- Only, you know, don't be too strict with Maurice. He's like me, very nervous, very delicate; don't upset him too much.
Alberte replied with a smile, and Madame de Valroux, satisfied with what she took to be tacit assent to her ideas, left her.
After his departure, the young girl remained thoughtful for a while; then she picked up her pen again and wrote the following letter with a steady hand:
"My dear aunt,
"Your letter has greatly distressed me. Not only does Roger doubt me, but his mother is ready to accuse me.
"Forgive me both for fumbling a little, and wait for the appointed time.
"It's not my fault that I still can't see my destiny clearly.
"But rest assured that I will not be affected by contrary influences, and that the rumours that are circulating are not as important as they seem to be.
Here Alberte rested her head on her hand and fell into a deep reverie.
Her heart was still with Roger, but could she honestly write to her mother that the stranger had not become a formidable rival?
That day, she had abruptly interrupted the dizzying life she had been leading for some time; that day, she had wanted to escape the company of Luna and David.
Was it because she felt drawn towards the Louzéma family?
Or was it because the sight of Roger's sadness had impressed her?
She didn't know exactly what she was feeling, but she recognised that her two suitors remained opposite each other, without her heart or her reason deciding to sacrifice one to the other.
The intimate voice, the one that resonates in the depths of the soul, called out Roger's name; the other, the voice that is heard every day, every minute, the one that reverberates endlessly because it is echoed everywhere, the voice of personal interest, called out David's name.
Roger was both harmony and dependence.
David represented contrasts and freedom.
One represented the known life, uniform, concentrated, relatively modest.
The other, the unknown life, eventful, expansive, brilliant.
One represented deep, faithful, delicate affection.
The other was passion, both fiery and hidden, but persevering.
And so, when she reached this paragraph of protest, Alberte stopped mechanically and measured, not without a secret dread, the change that had taken place in her feelings since her meeting at the hotel with her aunt de Châteaugrand.
When she took up her pen again, two tears were falling from her silky eyelashes onto her paper, and, without thinking of wiping them away, she continued:
"I am very fond of Mademoiselle Louzéma, who reminds me of a moving year in my childhood; but in the end all this does not yet weigh on the decision to come. Believe me, my dear aunt, if it were otherwise, I would have the loyalty to warn you. So reassure Roger, and let him let the world speak, since most of the time it doesn't know what it's saying.
"I am attending a last ball this evening; Carnival is dying, the gossip of the salon will die with it.
"With what relief I see Lent coming! I must confess, my dear aunt, that I was beginning to tire of it.
"This life of pleasure is very dangerous. You no longer know what you are doing or where you are going. In this respect, I was weak; I let myself be dragged much further than I would have liked. But, once again, here comes Lent and the preaching of Our Lady. My strangers, so keen to follow me to the festivals, will certainly abandon me here; I'm sure of it. At last I'll be able to breathe.
"When I think that in a few months I will have to make an irrevocable decision, I feel the need to reflect a little.
"Why aren't you here? Why isn't Roger here?
"Farewell, my dear aunt; wait to be angry with me, wait to condemn me, because, in truth, I love you with all my heart.
"Alberte.
"P. S. Médéric was very unhappy that Madeleine thought it appropriate to change the cotillion conductor. It deprived me of dancing with Roger.
Having finished this letter, Alberte put it in an envelope, sealed it, wrote the address and went herself to throw it in the box in the corridor.
That done, she headed for the study room, where Mademoiselle Adèle was teaching the future Marquis de Valroux the basics of writing, with patience that was ill-rewarded.
The entrance of Alberte produced its usual effect: Maurice took up his penholder, which he was amusing himself by rolling from one end of the table to the other, and Agnès studied her English lesson with new ardour.
Alberte came and sat between the two children, where she remained patiently during the last hour of study, looking after Maurice in particular, who loathed her lessons.
When it was time for Mademoiselle Adèle to pack up, Alberte said a few words in a low voice to Agnès. The little girl disappeared and returned accompanied by a maid carrying a tray covered with a hearty snack.
The young teacher gave Alberte a grateful look.
She came from Les Batignolles every morning, and her only breakfast on the omnibus was a penny roll.
So at eleven o'clock, after three hours of lessons, she seemed absolutely exhausted, and it was one of Alberte's pleasures to make her have a snack, washed down with a generous glass of wine.
While Mademoiselle Adèle regained her strength, Maurice and Agnès hurried off to the flat where they used to play, followed by Alberte, who made it a point of honour not to leave them when their mother had put her in charge.
- I'm going to dress up as a dragon, like my cousin Roger," Maurice said suddenly.
Alberte took down a small golden helmet, adorned with a superb crest and a red plume, and helped the little boy to get dressed.
- Do I look handsome like this?
And climbing onto a chair, he gazed at himself in the mirror and said:
- I'm almost as tall as Roger in this chair, aren't I, Auntie?
Alberte smiled without answering, for at that moment a servant in a small livery opened the door and announced that mademoiselle was being served.
Alberte found it difficult to persuade Maurice to leave his uniform, which he wanted to keep on for lunch. He managed to keep his belt on and made his way to the dining room, hanging on Alberte's arm and watching the sabre dragging at his heels.
The dining room, lit by two large windows opening onto the garden, was one of the most beautiful flats in the hotel. Above each doorway were masterly depictions of rural or mythological scenes. On the wide panel to the right of the vast fireplace, all the hunting gear had been carved; on the panel to the left, all the fishing gear. The ceiling roses were overflowing with flowers and fruit; a grapevine laden with grapes emblazoned the cornice around the perimeter; everything was a reminder, in one way or another, of the use to which the immense room had been put from time immemorial.
Three place settings had been placed at the top of the solid oak table, and Alberte took her place between the two children, who seemed delighted with this lunch for three.
Alberte looked like a real young mother between her two guests, whose lively chatter she listened to with condescending attention.
When lunch was over, she suggested a drive, which was enthusiastically accepted.
Madame de Valroux was overly cautious about allowing her children to go for a drive on ice-covered days, and they were delighted to see the Champs-Élysées and the Bois de Boulogne again. They fetched Morin and set off with Alberte, who had left them free to choose the route of the drive.
Paris still bore the scars of its terrible winter. The municipal broom, gigantic though it was, had not yet finished its task.
Passers-by glanced with displeasure or irony at the piles of solidified and soiled snow. People in the street wondered what Parisian councillors were thinking about, and loudly implored them to worry less about politics and a little more about administration.
The children, in the closed carriage, missed the snow, the sleighs, everything that had temporarily transformed Paris into a northern city. At least they had the pleasure of watching skating on the lake. The fanatics were still skating, but not with the full freedom of the early days. Here and there, stakes were posted to indicate places where the softening of the ice made skating dangerous.
Agnès and Maurice obtained Alberte's permission to get out of the car and cross the Seine where numerous skaters could see that the ice was solid.
Old Morin, standing on the shore, watched Alberte walk along with a child in each hand. They formed the loveliest group in the world, beauty, grace and elegance coming together in these two charming ages of youth and childhood.
It was already late when the carriage returned to Paris.
Alberte had given her orders to the coachman, who drove them to the church of Sainte-Clotilde. There, she sent the carriage away and, accompanied by the children and old Morin, attended the blessing which concluded the touching exercise of the Quarante-Heures.
Indeed, while foolish and godless Paris was indulging in its saturnalia, serious and fervent Paris was filling the temples and singing the Parce, Domine with all its soul.
In this way, the balance was restored in the terrible scales in which the good and evil accomplished on this earth are piled up before the Supreme Judge.
If there are those who blaspheme, there are those who adore; if there are those who offend, there are those who atone; if there are those who curse, there are those who give thanks; if there are those who descend to the level of the brute, there are those who rise to that of the angels.
Alberte, swept along with her sister and faster than she would have liked into the worldly whirlpool in which permitted pleasures are so abused that it only takes a slightly violent jolt to make weak souls fall into the abyss of illegitimate and fatal joys, liked to rest her poor torn heart in prayer.
There, more than anywhere else, in silence and peace, she reflected on the forthcoming outcome of her destiny.
Now, if all earthly influences were pushing her towards David, divine influences were drawing her back towards Roger.
David, by a clever ruse, never offended her in his beliefs; but she was too intelligent, and therefore too clear-sighted, not to guess that it was Roger who shared them.
David's faith was grafted onto his love for a member of the de la Rochefaucon Catholic family; Roger's faith remained independent of it.
And that was what made him great in Alberte's eyes. She felt flattered by the role she was fulfilling for her foreign friends, whom she was making proselytes of; but she recognised that in this very delicate question of religion, it was up to the man in his family to be the initiator and the example.
Once they had received their blessing, the strollers set off again on foot for the hotel, where Alberte was greeted with a green rebuke.
Madame de Valroux, who had just arrived, scolded her severely for taking the children to Sainte-Clotilde. She had hoped to kiss them when she arrived. Alberte must have thought that a mother who had been deprived of her children for a whole day was thirsty to see them again.
Alberte's only response to this display of emotion was silence.
Madame de Valroux's mood softened a little during dinner and she deigned to talk about her visit to Chantilly, which had been a disillusion.
It had been bitterly cold, the forest was dreadful, we hadn't been able to show the castle to the walkers, as the Duc d'Aumale had just arrived, and we'd had a terrible lunch,
- And the Louzéma family," asked Alberte, "were they as disappointed as you?
- First of all, David was in a foul mood, because you weren't there: he didn't open his mouth; then Luna had a sore throat and didn't speak either.
"I suppose you'll find it polite to go and find out about your friend tomorrow.
- I will," said Alberte, hoping by this promise to lessen the wrath of her sister, who blamed her for having, by her refusal, turned a day of pleasure into a day of boredom.
- I promised her on your behalf; she was really unwell and won't be coming to the Opera this evening.
- She must be feeling indisposed. I'd like to do what she did.
Madame de Valroux gave him a displeased look.
- What's the matter with you? Have you thought of starting your Lenten fast today?
- I feel tired," said Alberte, "and if you would allow me...
- Of course, that's all we need! Médéric, didn't I tell you that Alberte had Lenten ideas?
- You told me, Madeleine; but if she feels tired...
- That's pure contradiction! What is our poor little carnival! It's not like that of these rich foreigners.
"Mademoiselle Luna confessed to me that for the last five weeks she has only gone to bed at three in the morning.
- She's almost sick too," says Alberte, "and she's been coughing a lot for some time.
- Well, I'm warning you that if she hadn't had a sore throat, she'd still have been with us this evening. But when you have to bundle up, you can't go to the theatre in such a prominent box. Monsieur David will be coming and he's even thought of you.
"Médéric, where did you put the bouquets that Mr David had delivered by car?
- I had them placed in water. They're superb.
- Beautiful! I don't know where he got them. But he has so much money and he's perfectly nice!
- I don't like him," shouted little Maurice, who was listening, "he's not in uniform and he doesn't pay any attention to us, does he, Agnès?
- Maurice, shut up, you're being rude! Agnes, take your brother with you. I'll say goodnight to you when I'm dressed. Alberte, don't bother about the children, the governess doesn't need your help.
- I'd like to see the bouquets," said Maurice.
- That's more reasonable. I'll allow Alberte to show them to you. Médéric, where are they?
- In your dressing room.
- Alberte, do you hear me? What will you wear tonight?
- Whatever you like," says Alberte.
- There are lots of roses in your bouquet, so wear something pink.
Alberte nodded and left with the children.
No sooner had the door closed behind her than Madame de Valroux, looking at her husband with comic horror, exclaimed:
- Do you understand her? A little more, she was keeping us company this evening.
Monsieur de Valroux laughed.
- Don't trust her, Madeleine, she's not as advanced in your plans as you think.
- Do you think it would be unwise to risk asking her now?
- Yes, I think it would.
- However, you understand that David cannot remain in Paris indefinitely, and that he is only waiting for a signal to declare himself.
- I understand; I understand that you are taking on a very great responsibility here, Madeleine, and that all your intrigues could well fail at the last moment.
- It will be your fault, Médéric.
"If you would help me a little more energetically too! If you'd side with David!
"But no; you are for and against. It's about time you decided to take up our cause. Without you, we can do nothing.
Monsieur de Valroux raised his shoulders.
- It's none of my business," he said, "and I beg you not to keep harping on about your sister's suitors.
He rose from the table, obviously annoyed, and went to his smoking room, the only place in the house where he could be sure of escaping his wife's importunities.
VII -- Alberte on a visit
If Alberte had listened to her sister's advice, she would have gone to see Luna Louzéma very early in the morning; but she had her own reasons for delaying her visit.
Firstly, she was devoting the morning of Ash Wednesday to religious exercises; secondly, she had received a sort of declaration from David the day before, brought about in a natural way by the disappointment he had felt at seeing her miss the Chantilly party, and she did not want to go and see her sister at an hour when she could be sure of meeting him.
Consequently, despite Madame de Valroux's claim that she had to surprise Luna, she attended the service and agreed to be taken, after the second breakfast, by Monsieur de Valroux who was going to a long conference with his coachbuilder, whose shops were on the Champs-Élysées.
So she left at about two o'clock in the afternoon, accompanied by her brother-in-law, who had undertaken to pick her up.
- Above all, Alberte, don't say a word about your suitors," Monsieur de Valroux said with a smile, grabbing the white reins with his gloved hands. I'm irritated.
- Médéric, am I to believe that you are absolutely indifferent to the question, as you claim, or that you are completely in favour of Monsieur Louzéma, as Madeleine claims?
- She claims that? That's a powerful statement!
- Is it not true?
Monsieur de Valroux whipped his horse.
- By Jove, it's not true. I don't want to influence you, I want to remain neutral, absolutely neutral. I'm in the balcony watching the joust. Both champions are equally sympathetic to me; but that's none of my business.
- However, Médéric, a word of advice would be invaluable to me, and who do you want me to ask if not you?
- Alberte, I beg you not to ask me anything. In all things, except politics, I am in favour of non-intervention, and here everything dictates neutrality.
"If I espoused Roger de Châteaugrand's cause, all I would have to do would be to plead for separation, and it would no longer be possible for me to live together with your sister.
- It is not generous to leave me without support, Médéric.
- Come on, you have plenty of it. The Duc de la Rochefaucon, head of name and arms, your sister, your aunt de Bonlieu, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
- You know very well, Médéric, that this world only cares about external things.
"Besides, they don't get on.
"My uncle de la Rochefaucon does not want to sacrifice birth to fortune.
"As for Madeleine, you know only too well her partiality for David.
- But you, Alberte, what are your feelings about these two men?
"Let's see: it's not just out of courtesy that you welcome this stranger's homage.
Alberte blushed beneath her veil.
- He feigns such great passion," she said, "I am sometimes so touched by it that I wonder how far my compassion will go.
- I suspected that the mine he was digging would reach your heart, and that's why, my dear Alberte, I remained neutral.
- Yes, by preferring Roger.
- By Jove!
But after this exclamation which had escaped him, Monsieur de Valroux resumed cheerfully:
- Let's stick to your preferences, I beg you, and let there never be any question of mine.
- However, Médéric, only you can talk to me about things that are rarely discussed. You have often said: "Roger is the only man to whom I would gladly give my daughter.
"Would you give her to David Louzéma?
Monsieur de Valroux bit his moustache and answered evasively:
- Roger, my dear, is in certain respects a real exception; no one should be compared to Roger.
- But what do you think of David?
- David is a very gallant man, a man like everyone else.
"But where are our conventions, Alberte? I asked you not to say a word to me about your suitors and, if we continue, we'll talk about them again when I drop you off at your friend's door.
"Wrap yourself up better than that: it's freezing cold.
- The weather's fine," said Alberte.
And they went on talking about the rain and the fine weather until the horse stopped, white with foam, in front of an elegant hotel on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.
- John," said Monsieur de Valroux to the servant sitting behind, "ask if Mademoiselle Louzéma can see Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
The servant jumped down to the gate and returned, announcing that Mademoiselle Luna was there.
Alberte went downstairs, told her brother-in-law she would meet him in an hour's time and headed for the staircase. She had just reached the last few steps when the gleaming front door opened in front of her.
A servant was waiting for her; he relieved her of her surplus clothes and she climbed to the first floor by a staircase with a gilded banister, covered with a dazzling carpet. Everything in this house was dazzling, revealing wealth and foreign taste.
At the door of Luna's flat, the servant who was leading Alberte in bowed and, after knocking, moved away.
It was a strangely dressed woman with fiery black eyes and a fixed, gentle gaze who came to open the door.
- Rika, may I see your mistress?" asked Alberte.
But before Rika could reply, Luna herself, Luna in her pink cashmere bathrobe and silver-embroidered slippers, Luna with her magnificent ebony hair spread over her shoulders, had come running and thrown herself into Alberte's arms.
- My dear, how are you?" Alberte asked the graceful creature, who looked so frail in her elegant clothes.
- Much better; it's nothing; your visit will cure me completely," replied Luna, putting her arm under his. If you'd come to Chantilly yesterday, I wouldn't have caught a cold. But you're cruel, just like you used to be, my dear little duchess.
As she said this, Luna kissed her and led her to a blue sofa by the fireplace, where a large fire was burning.
Rika had gone and squatted on a large cushion at the foot of the bed, at the other end of the flat, and Alberte could see her fiery eyes still fixed on her young mistress, whose flat she lived in and whose devoted slave she was, as in India.
Rika's only understanding of European languages was the poor Portuguese spoken in her faraway country, and she was always there like a vigilant and faithful sentinel.
- You look different, Luna," said Alberte, fixing her deep eyes on the girl's face.
Luna raised her hand to her breast.
- I have a terrible fire there," she said.
- Luna, you shouldn't go out at night: it's not safe.
- And what do you want me to do?
Alberte glanced around the luxurious flat, where there was nothing remotely reminiscent of work in its intellectual or manual form.
- It's true," she said, "you don't know how to keep busy at home, poor Luna.
- No, no," said Luna, shaking her pretty head, "we're not the kind of people who do needlework or annotate big, serious books.
- So you're bored at home.
- My dear, I'm not sure that you French women enjoy yourselves when you have a tapestry in your hands or a feather between your fingers.
- That's what's deceiving you, Luna. Work, especially when it has something useful in view, is often distracting.
- Useful! What's that?" says the young girl, curling up in her cushions. Rika, my box of pastilles.
After giving this order to her Indian, she put one of her arms around Alberte's neck, kissed her and, smiling tenderly, said:
- What is useful, my dear?
- There's no point in telling you, Luna, your life has been cast in a separate mould. But I thought you recognised the need to create some kind of occupation for yourself.
- Yes, Alberte, but what? My God, what?
- You'd laugh if I answered you as a Frenchwoman, Luna, and you'd laugh even more if I answered you as a German.
"But after all, if the useful is foreign to you, you have the pleasant.
"Make music... if you like it.
- I especially like other people's music," said Luna, taking a small sandalwood box from her Indian friend. When you see my piano open, it means that David has come to pay me a visit. He's very strong, David, and he's getting more and more enthusiastic about music. There's a certain reverie... would you like a pastille, Alberte?... a reverie of... a German name.
- Mendelssohn.
- Precisely, the one you like so much and play so well, he's passionate about it. He plays it for me, he plays it for Carmen, who can't stand it because you love her.
- Luna, what a joke!
- It's true, Carmen doesn't love you. Carmen doesn't love you. She thinks you're contemptuous of our colony. And there's another reason, a major one, that I'm not telling you about.
Luna crunched a lozenge, rolled the box between her fingers and added, leaning on Aberte's shoulder:
- Did the lovely Marquise tell you about David's fury yesterday? No, I've never seen him so angry.
- No doubt Mr David had some reason to be upset," replied Alberte, embarrassed by Luna's look.
- He had... that one. He restrained himself in front of Monsieur and Madame de Valroux, but when he came back it started again. He whipped his horse just like in the old days, do you remember? He used to whip his little negro Boulboul (1) .
- I remember," said Alberte, "but at our request he had mellowed.
- Cheers, Alberte, cheers. Oh, you've always done what you wanted with him.
But, tell me, didn't he look awful at the Opera?
- He was what he always is, Luna.
- Come on, look at me. Have you got some sort of painkiller on your face, or are your eyes distilling some sort of balm? Because the truth is, when he came to kiss me, he was all pale and tense. If I hadn't been speechless, I would have got dressed to go with him, so afraid was I that he might make a scene. Oh, he's jealous, David, very jealous.
- That's an ugly fault," said Alberte in a serious tone.
And she added, touching Luna's slender hand, which was burning hot:
- Who's looking after you, Luna? You seem to be coughing a lot, and you certainly have a bit of a fever.
- Everyone and no one," replied Luna, bringing her batiste handkerchief to her lips.
"The doctors send me home for the slightest cold, and I don't go to them any more.
"My real doctor is Rika. She makes exquisite herbal teas with I don't know what seeds from our country, and it cures my simple colds.
She turned her head away languidly and spoke softly in Portuguese to the Indian woman crouched on her cushion, and Alberte could not remember ever having met a more loving gaze than the one with which Luna's eyes, full of flame, responded to her.
- Alberte, I can't give you an appointment for the ball this evening," said Luna, "Lent is very boring.
- Indeed, with the sermon replacing the ball, it's enough to make you despair.
- But we still have the theatre. You go to the theatre during Lent, I suppose?
- I suppose not.
- Good heavens! And Madame de Valroux?
- My sister does what she wants. I speak only for myself.
- Ah, I can understand why our colony wants to leave Paris," exclaimed Luna. I'm tempted to leave for Italy too.
- Why don't you go, Luna? The climate in Italy would suit you much better than ours.
- I know it would; all the doctors have advised me to spend the winter in the South of France, and we'd have a lovely stay in Rome for Holy Week, which, it seems, will be in vogue for ever; but David won't hear of leaving Paris.
She looked fixedly at Alberte and added with a mischievous air:
- But, Alberte, why not ask me why?
Alberte blushed, but answered with a slight movement of her shoulders:
- My God, you're such a child, Luna! I've never known how to meddle in things that don't concern me.
- Alberte, oh, how ungrateful you are!" cried Luna. Can you tell from that icy expression that you don't care?
Alberte's hand came to rest over Luna's mouth.
- Hush," she said, "hush, there's a knock at your door.
- Oh, but I'm not receiving a knock today," Luna replied briskly.
She spoke in Portuguese to Rika, who immediately got up and went to ajar the door.
But a push from outside opened it completely, and a veritable whirlwind of young girls invaded the room.
There were seven of them, all prettier and more elegant than the last, with the exception of the Portuguese girl Carmen.
- But you'll suffocate me," exclaimed Luna as they all rushed into her arms. Let's see, what are you doing in my house today?
- To hear from you," they replied in unison.
- It wasn't worth it, I wasn't dying. Who told you I was indisposed?
- Your absence last night," replied Carmen.
-- So I'm not allowed to be tired? Now I'll have to go to the Opera every time Faust is played. I tell you you're crazy.
"Please don't sit down again, let me introduce you to Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- We know Mademoiselle," replied Carmen with a deep look in her eyes. I helped find her, I think. She's your little duchess, isn't she, Luna, Monsieur David's Alberte?
- Yes, yes, yes," said Luna three times without daring to look at Alberte. Well, Sixta, why don't you sit down, now that I've been introduced?
- Take a good look at me, Luna," said the young Portuguese girl, whose toilet was very eccentric.
- Well, it's done. I see that you're using red powder to muss up your blond hair, and that you're dressed in such a way that from a distance you could be mistaken for a tightly tied bundle.
- I don't know what resemblance there is to a grasshopper," added Carmen, who was very intelligent.
The young girl shook her red mane in disappointment and exclaimed:
- Luna, you'll be sorry you made fun of me when you find out who I was taken for the other night.
- Who does she look like?" asked Luna, addressing Alberte.
A name came to Alberte's lips, but she didn't say it, just smiled with a hint of disdain.
- At last, Luna, it's striking," exclaimed the girl's younger sister. Yesterday, three playwrights entered our dressing room one after the other, thinking they'd find... guess who?
- Our most famous actress," said Luna.
The girl jumped for joy.
- You see," she said, "I bear an extraordinary resemblance to her, although I'm not as beautiful.
And she sighed.
- Less beautiful?" said Alberte. She's not beautiful, that I know of. She's a good actress with a charming voice, but let's not talk about her beauty.
Everyone, even Luna, cried out.
If Alberte hadn't come from the noble suburbs, if she hadn't been pretty, the whole pack of young girls wouldn't have forgiven her for daring to touch their idol.
Luna herself did not fail to champion the actress.
They spoke so quickly, they shouted so much in unison, that Alberte thought it prudent to wrap herself in a haughty silence which soon brought the visit to an end.
Basically, all these girls were as good as they were beautiful, and belonged to parents who knew how to keep them from equivocal liaisons.
Nevertheless, their admiration for actresses and their fanaticism for fashionable singers had so completely displeased Alberte that, when Luna returned to her after the last embraces at the door, where these young ladies met their mentors, she said to her in a hurt tone:
- My dear Luna, I shall never understand the sympathies of your world or yours for the demi-monde.
Luna, before replying, threw her arm round her neck with the tender embrace that had captured the heart of the proud descendant of the La Rochefaucon family, and said banteringly:
- What do you want, Alberte, these people amuse us; and these gentlemen arouse our interest in these women by talking incessantly about them and their adventures.
Alberte frowned her chestnut eyebrows.
- Ah!" she said, "the men of your world talk about that in front of young girls!
- Not all," said Luna, visibly embarrassed, "not all. Oh, we have daddies who are so reasonable, so sensible! And Carmen is also very reserved about it, as you've noticed; but she's less disinterested than you in the matter. She knows that all this gossip displeases David... and me too, since we've been seeing each other so intimately, Alberte.
"I'm less and less like my friends, who make their living from the theatre.
"That crazy little Isabelle, who reddens her beautiful blonde hair, knows all about it.
"One day she said in front of us: "The theatre is a supreme interest in my life, the theatre is enough for me.
And when she had gone, David exclaimed: "There's a woman I'll never marry.
Alberte did not respond to this last word, but asked Luna:
- Are you coming to Notre-Dame on Sunday?
- If you like, Alberte. They say it's beautiful.
- Very beautiful.
- David has managed to get a good seat. His conversion is progressing, Alberte. He has books at home this big.
She moved her hands half a metre apart and continued, still laughing:
- Perhaps it's to finish it that he wants to stay in Paris, to listen to the sermons of that Father in the white robe... and yours.
- They're very nice," said Alberte, who didn't see fit to pick up on the joke, "and if you come, we'll try to understand.
- So it's not easy.
- For women... no. But I don't want to frighten you in advance. Just come along and bundle up warmly. Notre-Dame is freezing.
And with that, Alberte got up,
- Are you leaving me, Alberte, already?
- I thought I heard my brother-in-law's car, I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.
Luna put her finger on a silver stamp. Rika, who seemed to be dozing, raised her head quickly and rushed to the door.
The servant who had brought Alberte in had just informed her that the Marquis de Valroux and his carriage were waiting for her.
This destroyed all the little plan that Luna had been trying to arrange to keep her visitor.
So the two girls kissed and said a tender goodbye, and Alberte left Luna, who went to raise the embroidered blind on one of her windows, to give herself the pleasure of seeing her cross the courtyard.
She was not the only one. At the very moment that Alberte left Luna's room, a door was raised at the back of the flat, David tiptoed in and advanced to the window, from which you could see the whole courtyard that Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon was crossing with her noble and graceful step.
VIII -- Where are we?
- It was her," said David, letting down the blind and striding into the flat; "I thought I recognised her voice among the shouts of our compatriots.
Luna, who had turned round smiling, looked at her brother in astonishment.
- And you didn't come!" she exclaimed. "I did everything I could to hold her back, hoping that you would arrive.
He raised his shoulders slightly.
- So that's what you've got to do with the habits of the big world," he said.
- I don't understand," says Luna. Every time Alberte visits me, you turn up.
- Because you receive Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon in your salon; but I never appear when, knowing you're ill, she comes to see you in your flat.
- Well, that's that!" said Luna as she dropped onto the blue sofa.
David spun round and stood in front of his sister.
- How far have we got?" he asked in a wheezy voice. I'd be obliged if you'd tell me.
Luna put her ivory hand to her eyes.
- Don't look like that, David," she said, "I'm afraid for her.
He smiled strangely and, softening his voice, continued:
- Don't worry about her, but tell me, tell me how far we've come.
- Sit down, David, you look agitated, nervous, sit down.
- There," said the young man, pushing a footstool in front of his sister.
She smiled tenderly at him and threatened him with her finger:
- You could answer that question better than I could," she said. Do I need to remind you of the statement you made yesterday at the theatre? Wasn't it well received?
- Did she talk to you about it?
- No, she didn't say a word to me.
- So you see. And now, Luna, tell me where we are.
- But, David, it seems to me that we're approaching the denouement. Monsieur de Châteaugrand no longer appears on the horizon and Madame de Valroux is talking about the trousseau in hushed tones.
David made a gesture of spite.
- You're not going out with Madame de Valroux," he said; "it's not about her. You can't count on that mad head.
- David, what ingratitude! It's thanks to that dear Marquise that we've been able to get to where we are.
- So be it. What next?
- But everyone's talking about your marriage to Alberte as if it were a simple thing.
David crossed his arms.
- And what's everyone doing about it? What is she saying herself? Do you know, Luna?
- She's so delicate, so reserved! replied Luna with embarrassment. French women are very distinguished, but they're not very expansive!
- That's why I dream of marrying one," murmured David.
- Well, when are you going to ask her? Because it will have to come to that.
- When I'm sure I won't be turned down.
- Madame de Valroux says you won't be refused.
- How does she know?
- But, David, she wouldn't go so far if she wasn't sure of the result. She is working the de la Rochefaucon family, and many are surrendering, she says.
"There's still the duke and the canoness of Bonlieu, who doesn't like the Châteaugrands, but is steeped in prejudice. I make a thousand advances to her when I meet her at Madame de Valroux's, but I don't dare go to her yet.
David let out a chuckle.
- Ah!" he said, "if these were the only obstacles to overcome, I wouldn't care. But it's her, it's her. You see, Luna, I didn't think there was a prouder person on earth than David Louzéma.
"Well, there is, and it's Alberte de la Rochefaucon.
- I don't think so," said Luna.
- How! here is a woman for whom I am making the folly of marrying at twenty-five, to whom I am offering a princely fortune, at whose feet I am laying down my independence, since I am giving her the right to put me under the yoke of a religion, since I am leaving her free to choose the place where I shall pitch my tent, and all these sacrifices only obtain for me permission to claim her hand!
"Ah, Luna, there are times when I hate this passion, when I hate the influence that this too seductive Frenchwoman has taken over me, when I want to leave for India and settle there, where I rule over a people of slaves.
- David, you would give up Alberte!" cried Luna, whose eyes filled with tears.
He leapt to his feet and, with eyes that flashed flames, said:
- No. There is only one aristocracy in Europe for me, and that is the French aristocracy.
"I don't see why I shouldn't marry one of its daughters, I who have gold and two centuries of domination over the savages of our settlements.
"But waiting is no longer bearable for me. I am tired of bowing to every whim of Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon, tired of following her into ethereal regions that are not my own.
"This affair is just one more charm for your life, Luna, it's getting in the way of mine.
- I don't understand," said Luna.
David looked at her admiringly.
- Is there not," he said in a singularly penetrating voice, "a being called a salamander that has been given the ability to pass through flames without burning itself? It's like you, Luna.
- I understand less and less; speak more intelligibly, David.
- What's the point? Ah, you don't understand that you're an exception in our feverish society, which pursues only one thing: pleasure.
- But, David, you're joking. I like pleasure enough to make myself sick. My bronchitis comes from dancing too much during Carnival.
- Yes, but as a salamander, always as a salamander.
- God! if I looked like some of our compatriots, Alberte wouldn't even want to give me her hand," exclaimed Luna.
- That's why I look to you as my strongest support in my projects, without you I would have abandoned them. But the truth is, my patience is wearing thin, and I'm beginning to think that our allies are betraying us. Madame de Valroux is unable to find the time to prepare the Duc de la Rochefaucon for my request; Madame de Lextreville, who was so certain that she would be able to influence the canoness de Bonlieu through a dizzy woman of her acquaintance, has not shown any sign of life.
- They are waiting for the request, perhaps; once the request is made, they will act, especially if they guess Alberte's consent!
David buried his white hands in his frizzy hair.
- Ah!" he grumbled, "if I guessed, I wouldn't wait for the good pleasure of all these antiquarians; but I hesitate, because I'm trembling.
"Did you tell her about our resolution to stay in Paris for Lent?
- Yes; she seemed pleased.
- I'm afraid of the number of sermons I'll have to endure.
- They say the sermons at Notre-Dame are so beautiful.
- Yes..." he said gloomily, "but of a beauty all their own... There's an eagle in these great Catholic orators. I'm not saying that it's the power of truth that lifts them so high; but these truths are overwhelming for a man like me!
- I don't think so," said Luna with her childlike smile.
She turned away.
- What do you want from me, Rika? A letter?
She held out her hand and took the letter presented to her by the slave.
No sooner had she read a few lines than she cried out:
- David, listen, oh listen. One of the fortresses has surrendered.
- Explain yourself, Luna.
- Listen, it's from the Baroness de Lextreville.
And, opening the paper, she read in a voice that trembled with joy:
"Mademoiselle, the person I told you about has brought me some completely unexpected news.
"The fierce canoness softened. She is not far from surrendering, and with her a whole branch of Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon's family.
"But she said: "These young people have not paid me a visit. However, I would quite like to see at close quarters the man who aspires to become my nephew.
"Today is his reception day. It would be political to take advantage of the permission granted without delay.
"Go ahead, but don't talk to her about me, because she can't stand me. Let her talk to you about hygiene. Accept all the remedies that she will indicate to you, that will be taking her by her weak side.
"Farewell, good success and very affectionately yours.
"Baroness de Lextreville
"Here is the address of Madame la Comtesse de Bonlieu: Rue de Verneuil, 51.
- Shall we go?" asked Luna.
- But your throat!
- Precisely, it will be a topic of conversation.
- Come on," said David, heading for the door through which he had entered.
- Look pretty, David.
- Make yourself beautiful, Luna.
"How long will it take you to get ready?
- Half an hour at the most.
- Which car do you want?
- The closed pram.
- The pram it is," said David.
And he disappeared, leaving his sister to prepare the toilet in which she was to appear before Alberte's terrible aunt.
IX -- The Canoness
The canoness of Bonlieu lived in the left wing of her hotel in the rue de Verneuil. The rest was rented to a great industrialist retired from business, who had taken a liking to this large, quiet house, which he hardly lived in for more than four months of the year.
But by sacrificing the main building, which she would not have known what to do with, the canoness had not resigned herself to having the appearance of living in a corner of her own hotel and, in front of the main entrance to the pavilion, she had built a staircase topped by a marquee. At that moment, a large carriage bearing the coat of arms of the La Rochefaucon family was stopped in front.
It was in fact the Duc de la Rochefaucon and his daughter, Marie-Antoinette, who were at that moment at the home of the canoness, seated in her reception room.
The conversation was between her and the duke, a man in his fifties who, beneath the vulgarity of modern clothes, remained what he was: a very grand seigneur.
As for her daughter, she was, in her town dress, as we saw her at the Hôtel de la Rochefaucon: beautiful, serious, silent, a true lily, said the canoness, and a lily destined to bloom on an altar.
The canoness, comfortably seated in a large Louis XIII armchair, was explaining to her cousin the marvellous properties of a new remedy for gout.
- You see, Enguerrand," she said, "in medicine anything is possible. It is certain that God has given remedies for all illnesses. It's up to mankind to discover them.
- I don't know if the illnesses you're referring to have any place in God's plan, my cousin. How can you think that the Creator could have devised a remedy for an ailment that has its source in the excesses of good food, for example?
- There is, there is, there must be, I'm on the lookout for it, because God knows how many people are martyred by gout.
The duke bowed and smiled.
- There's no reason why you shouldn't hope so," he said.
He glanced at the oak table with the fluted legs that served as an armrest for the canoness and added:
- You're not short of material for your hygienic meditations, are you?
The canoness ran her white hand over the books with common covers that cluttered the table.
- There are treasures of health here," she said, "but unfortunately these authors sometimes contradict themselves.
"I laughed a lot just now when I read an article on typhoid fever in two different volumes - it was like night and day. It really is time to come to an agreement on the treatment to be given for this all-too-common and all-too-familiar disease.
- Ah, to agree, my cousin! That's the whole point.
- Especially in politics, I see you coming, Enguerrand; but I am more and more at odds with politics. If you want to please me, never do it in my house. Do you know why I find the company of strangers charming, do you know why I seek it out? It is because they at least have the courtesy not to talk to me about the doings of the government that has fallen to us. Their ignorance is my joy.
"The other day a good Portuguese gentleman confused the Martignac ministry with the Guizot ministry, for him it was all the same.
- It seems to me that there aren't many foreigners in Paris at the moment.
- Sorry, there are a lot. I sometimes see real foreigners at Madeleine de Valroux's house. These ones are from so far away that I'd bet they don't even know the names of our current rulers.
- Perhaps you mean that charming young Indian girl that Alberte sees a lot of," said Marie-Antoinette.
- Precisely. Aren't they interesting?
- A little too much, I think," said the duke, biting his lips.
- Ah, you know them, my dear Enguerrand?
- I saw them at the transvestite ball that Madeleine gave this winter. There was a bit too much talk about them in her salons.
- What do you expect, the fashion is for foreign alliances.
- If I may say so, my cousin, this is where we need to agree.
- Certainly. I certainly don't approve of Alberte marrying this young foreigner any time soon.
- Is there any question of it?" asked the Duke sharply.
- I don't know. He is colossally rich and Madeleine is very fond of him.
- But not Alberte," cried the young girl.
- Alberte has never done me the honour of confiding in me," said the canoness, "I don't know Alberte's feelings on the subject at all. If she were a little dazzled by fortune, there would be nothing surprising in that. She would be very much of her century.
As she spoke these words, the heavy door lifted and a servant in livery announced:
- Mr and Miss Louzéma!
- Well, it's them," murmured the canoness.
And holding out her hand:
- Stay a moment, Enguerrand," she said, "it's good for you to see them up close, if only to advise Alberte from time to time.
And having said that, she raised her head and put on a great air to welcome her visitors.
But her appearance was grace itself compared to the Duke's icy face.
Luna, who was not lacking in poise, took no notice of this, and played her part very gracefully.
As her aunt was away, she did not make many visits outside her circle; but she had not wanted to put off paying her respects to Madame de Valroux's aunt.
This gracious introduction buoyed up the canoness, who set about being friendly to the beard of her cousin Enguerrand, whose great coldness vexed her a little.
When he rose to leave, she said not a word to detain him.
- But, madame, you have charming nieces," said Luna, when the duke and his daughter had disappeared. Is beauty a gift attached to the de la Rochefaucon family?
The canoness smiled at this delicate compliment and replied:
- Mademoiselle, you have guessed perfectly correctly. There's a proverb that says that every woman in the de la Rochefaucon family must have: beautiful eyes, a good figure and a beautiful mind.
"Be that as it may, I can assure you that in the generation I have known the proverb has not been contradicted. My cousin Enguerrand, who has just left me, was one of the finest horsemen in France and Navarre, as you can still see, and his daughter is truly beautiful; but that won't stop her from shutting herself away in a Carmelite convent one of these days.
- Oh my God!" exclaimed Luna, shuddering.
- Madame, her father won't allow this crime of lèse-famille, will he?
- And why not, sir? Why should a father prevent his daughter from following this vocation, when he should be prepared to let her marry a man who is often a complete stranger?
"In our families we still practise true freedom, and we do not quarrel with God when he does them the honour of calling them to take their place in that elite phalanx which abandons the earth to the quarrels of men.
"More than one king's daughter has despised the world, which, after all, is full of ingratitude and selfishness. But I am speaking to you at too great a length about these things. I don't think you belong to the Catholic religion.
David and Luna cried out at the same time with a warmth that won them the good graces of the canoness. The conversation became increasingly cordial as the subject changed, and when the time came for the visit to end, Madame de Bonlieu very kindly escorted the brother and sister to the door of her salon. After making her last curtseys, she approached the window overlooking the courtyard. Raising the guipure blind slightly, she watched the Louzéma family climb into their dashing carriage.
- Princely luxury," she murmured, "luxury of the right kind, truly tempting fortune.
"And this little yellow man, seen up close, is terribly seductive; he has the most beautiful black eyes in the world, Roger de Châteaugrand need only behave himself. If I were Alberte, I would hesitate, I would hesitate a lot. It would be a small act of cowardice, but we live in strange times. Bad times in fact, cowardice is rampant not only in the streets but also in the salons. I myself am ready to... but no, shh, let's remain neutral, it will always be a little less cowardly.
X -- Where we talk
- Madam Marquise, forgive me for forcing my way into your door a little; but how could I fail to offer you my condolences on such an unexpected failure.
- A setback!" replied Madame de Valroux briskly as she entered the salon where Madame de Lextreville was sitting.
- Don't you know anything?
- Absolutely nothing. Tell me quickly what it's all about.
- I've just heard, take courage, I've just heard that the Louzéma have left for Italy.
- Is that your news?" said the Marquise de Valroux with a triumphant smile. Ah well, it's good news! Do sit down.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you. I've been told that you've been unwell and that you don't entertain on Sundays.
- But that didn't stop us seeing you.
John is really becoming extraordinarily intelligent. He realised that you were one of those people I received anyway. So sit down without remorse.
"My sore throat is mild, so mild!
- Is it your throat you're suffering from?
- Yes, it's my Lenten pain. When I have to accompany Monsieur de Valroux and my sister to this ice-cream parlour called Notre-Dame, I start my bronchitis. Joking aside, that cathedral gives me a cold and the sermon gives me a crazy headache. So, I decided to forego the sermon, pointing out that my bronchitis had become chronic and closing my door... apparently. John has orders to distinguish, among my relatives or acquaintances, those whose company would be agreeable to me on Sundays, and he is no longer mistaken; he guessed right when he let you defy the order. And now, sit down and let's talk.
"Were you really scared?
- And with good reason, Madame.
"Judge for yourself. At one o'clock mass in Saint-Thomas d'Aquin, I meet a Spanish lady who tells me about her troubles. Part of her colony had left for Italy the day before, and she was unable to follow because of a sick child. I asked her by chance for the names of the fugitives, and I shuddered with horror when I heard the name Louzéma.
- Madame," I said to her, "aren't you mistaken? I think I am sure that Mademoiselle Louzéma will not leave Paris this Lent.
"She replied that she had kissed Mademoiselle Luna in the carriage. So she had left, so our project, so cherished, so well under way, had gone down the drain.
- And if I were to tell you that this trip to Italy is advancing our business more than all the intrigues in the world.
- I don't understand any more.
- Because you don't know that if Luna goes, David stays.
It was Madame de Lextreville's turn to open her eyes wide.
- He's staying," she exclaimed, "he's separating from his sister!
- Yes! It's the most amusing story in the world.
"You know that Alberte, who is well versed in mystical things, set out to convert Luna and, in turn, her brother. It went like clockwork, and my sister counted on Lent and her preaching to ruin her friend's taste for worldly pleasures and religious indifference. She regularly took her to Notre-Dame and wherever her favourite preachers were heard.
"Luna let herself be taken there like a poor sheep to the slaughterhouse.
"But all these great things gave her migraine after migraine, neuralgia after neuralgia, and one fine evening, while showering Alberte with caresses, she announced that she was leaving the next day for Rome with her friend Carmen.
"At that moment, I thought everything was falling apart.
"But I didn't know David. He's an iron head. He coldly declared that Lent in Paris didn't frighten him and that he would stay in Paris. There followed a little silent scene that gave me more hope than I'd ever had before.
"Alberte's emotion when she heard David proclaim his rage for sermons proved to me that this devotion touched her heart. That's something, isn't it?
And the two loveseats laughed in unison.
- Isn't this a comedy he's playing?" asked Madame de Lextreville at last.
- I don't know, he's a strange man, he never gives himself away.
- He knows he's dealing with a tough game, and that's why he gets bored with perfect good grace, which is a great art.
- Yes, yes, he's charming and he has all the skills. Did you know that he has been decorated with some Indian order, and that he is applying for a diplomatic post?
- No, I didn't know that.
- Well, it's done, and when he makes the official application to our uncle de la Rochefaucon he can add on his card: 'Minister Plenipotentiary', which will look very good and which delighted the canoness.
- He will still be a diplomat for laughs.
- No matter! Our old parents will be happy and will give their consent, that's all that's needed. The Canonsess of Bonlieu is on the point of surrendering.
- And what has become of Monsieur de Châteaugrand?
- He fades on the strategic maps.
- And his mother?
- Alberte is sulking, fortunately for us. Our pride is nothing compared to that of these people, who look so simple and gentle.
"Madame de Châteaugrand is injured and no longer deigns to give any news, which saves us.
- It doesn't matter, you can't be sure of anything until you've ruled out this suitor.
- I know that, and that's why I'm racking my brains to find a reason to get rid of him altogether.
- But you know him well enough to know his weak side. There's always some delicate point in yourself that you can't touch without causing havoc and causing offence.
- I don't know any of the Châteaugrands; everything I could do, I did.
"I declared Roger to have a chest cold, believing nothing of it.
"I was indifferent, impolite even; it doesn't even matter. Roger makes light of my impertinences. We've never hit it off, and it's a pleasure for him to try and become my brother-in-law in spite of me, so to speak.
- But we need to find out something. If the case drags on, Miss Alberte will thank the stranger. We won't gain anything until we find a way to provoke a quarrel between Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon and her knight, who while playing the indifferent always remains on the horizon.
- And doesn't disarm, I'm sure.
As Madame de Valroux spoke these words, John, the servant so highly prized for his intelligence, lifted the door and announced Madame la Comtesse de Bonlieu. And as the canoness, leaning on the little cane that announced the onset of her rheumatism, made her way painfully through the large salon, the two young women exchanged a few quick words.
- Should I be saved," asked Madame de Lextreville? The amiable canoness has not yet accepted me.
- No, stay and let her talk about Alberte. Lower your veil. She doesn't know you very well, and I'll say you've come on business.
And with that, Madame de Valroux, hastily shaking off her long train, ran to meet her old relative.
- Well, Madeleine," said the latter, "I'll believe my premonition again. I told myself that you weren't at Notre-Dame and that, consequently, I was sure I'd run into you. You haven't been out in this fine weather?
- I've got bronchitis, Auntie, and I'm very sorry I can't keep up with the preaching.
- Well," said the canoness, taking up her cane, "it wouldn't be bronchitis that would prevent you from going to the opera, my dear. At last, at last! I can only say one thing: Happy are the uninhibited. But you are not alone, I believe, my niece.
- No, my aunt. Madame de... Lex... tre... ville... has come to talk business with me. But you're not disturbing me in any way. Please sit down. Not against the light, there's so little of it that there's no point in going without.
- I am well, Madeleine, I am very well. Madame, please don't trouble yourself on my account.
"And now, Madeleine, give me some news. Your husband and children are well.
- Couldn't be better. Médéric is at the sermon, and Agnès and Maurice are at the Jardin d'Acclimatation. Maurice, like me, has a mad passion for foreign birds. Every Sunday I send him to visit our parrot and parakeet lovers.
- To each his own, my dear, I find these beasts absolutely detestable.
"Ah! if I didn't have sciatica, I'd do what Médéric and Alberte did, I'd go to Notre-Dame.
- It's very beautiful," said Madame de Valroux, stifling a yawn.
- Very beautiful," repeated Madame de Lextreville.
- It certainly is. And what a nuisance it is to be deprived of these sermons! Unable to hear Father Monsabré, I read him.
"In these days of gibberish, it is very sweet to prove to oneself that one still speaks, at least from the pulpit, our beautiful French language.
As the French language was the least of Madame de Valroux's worries, she simply inclined her head in assent.
- In truth, I don't think that's where it's spoken any more," continued the canoness, waving her little cane.
"Our politicians themselves are so mediocre that when I read their speeches I find myself regretting Thiers. Yes, I who hated that little scoundrel Thiers, I who saw him at work to demolish the monarchy, I bitterly regret him, seeing by whom he has been replaced.
- You have always loved politics, Aunt.
- No doubt I have: I don't accept that anyone should lose interest in the affairs of their country, even when they do so without you being consulted in any way. And, finally, many of our people still lead a militant life. I'm not saying, for example, that they enjoy it. Even today I have proof to the contrary. I went out on Sunday in honour of my niece Thérèse de Bonlieu.
- Is she in Paris?" exclaimed Madame de Valroux.
- For two days, but so exhausted that she won't be able to make any visits and has asked me to bring her cousins from La Rochefaucon.
"Oh, the poor woman, how I pity her! You can't imagine such a life.
"Married for four years, here she is with her third child and moving house for the seventh time.
- She's moving again?
- Yes, she is. Go and marry officers!
"When she married, she had been told that her husband, being in the cavalry, would stay in the same garrison for ten years. Not at all. Our Minister of War, bitten by the political tarantula, has amused himself by giving his regiments a series of military rides. For these poor Croix-Sauvert men, it's been a cross-hunt from one end of France to the other, and here they are on their seventh move.
- I don't understand why Monsieur de la Croix-Sauvert doesn't resign.
The canoness frowned.
- How lightly you speak of that, my dear," she said. A resignation! But it's the most serious thing in the world. Once a man has entered the French army, once he has the honour of wearing the epaulette, he doesn't just throw the handle after the axe for miserable domestic worries.
- I would do it, Auntie, overwhelm me with your disdain, I would do it. Move seven times! I would never do that.
- How childish you are, Madeleine! Thérèse de Bonlieu is much more energetic than you are. She moans, she complains, she suffers; but she would never, ever talk to her husband about resigning.
"She has the purest French blood in her veins, and it shows.
- Mine is not Persian, as far as I know, Auntie, but I would never follow an army.
- Too bad for you, my dear. I agree with my nephew de la Croix-Sauvert and Monsieur de Châteaugrand. When you're in the army, you stay there.
- So this is also the opinion of the Châteaugrands, Aunt?
- In this, yes. Thérèse and Henri spent two days in Nantes, where Roger is in garrison, and the conversation between these gentlemen was, it seems, of a heroism that left nothing to be desired. In the final analysis, old France has the right and the duty to be represented in the French army.
- They say that Monsieur de Châteaugrand is very fond of military life," ventured Madame de Lextreville, who had not yet opened her mouth.
- Madame, he loves France passionately and wants to serve her. It seems, moreover, that he is like my nephew de la Croix-Sauvert, fanatical about the profession of arms.
"It's a taste of his race, he can't be blamed for it.
- It could be detrimental to his marriage," said Madame de Valroux with a learned air.
- That's not what will harm him. In the past, I know, it was in good taste to be an officer only until marriage; but we have been defeated and future officers would regard resigning as a cowardly act.
"However, I would never persuade a young girl to marry an officer, especially since I heard the story of my niece Thérèse.
"But speaking of Thérèse, will you go and see her, Madeleine? I'm not asking you to take you, since you're receiving her today; but promise me you'll go and kiss her before she leaves.
- I will, Auntie, if my bronchitis will let me, I'll take note of her moans and serve them to Alberte.
- I do hope that Alberte will take the trouble to go and commiserate with me herself.
- I can hear her footsteps and those of Médéric in the corridor.
- Will you allow me to take her?
- Oh, certainly, take her away. I don't suppose she'll mind going to see Thérèse. But who knows? She's been so whimsical lately.
- Like young girls who, being in great demand, don't know where to turn when it comes to making up their minds.
- Come right in, my pretty niece, I have a few words to say to you.
These last words of the canoness were addressed to Alberte, who was just opening the salon door, but who seemed reluctant to enter.
At this invitation, she came forward, all pink under her white tulle veil, followed by Monsieur de Valroux, who was carrying a magnificent bouquet, which Madame de Bonlieu took care of after the customary greetings.
- What flowers!" she exclaimed. Where did you find these flowers, Médéric?
- You'd have to ask Madame de Valroux's bouquet supplier," he replied, offering the splendid bouquet to his wife.
- Is it him?" she asked, glancing at Alberte.
- It's him," repeated Monsieur de Valroux in a tone that was both mocking and emphatic.
Madame de Bonlieu's little grey eyes sparkled with curiosity; but, as there was a stranger in the salon, she held back and, promising herself in petto that she would ask for the answer to the riddle later, she exclaimed:
- Médéric, tell us something about Notre-Dame. Was it beautiful?
- Superb!" replied M. de Valroux. You really come out of it all enlarged.
- And consequently ready for sacrifice, don't you think? added the canoness.
M. de Valroux grimaced expressively.
- That would indeed be the rigorous consequence of religious preaching," he said, "and we cannot say that the preacher does not set us an example. However, Aunt, you understand that Lent is not sufficiently advanced for us to fully accept the theory of this sublime but appalling thing called sacrifice.
- There's nothing frightening about the sacrifice I'm going to ask you to make, Médéric. All you have to do is come with me to see the mother of poor Thérèse de la Croix-Sauvert, née de Bonlieu. You know that, after four years of marriage, the unfortunate Thérèse has had her third child and has moved house seven times.
- Thérèse is in Paris?" exclaimed Alberte.
- For two days now, and the poor woman can't take it any more, and being obliged to leave this week for the North, thanks to this horrible garrison life that she was wrong to accept, she has sent me to find the friends and relatives she wishes to see.
"Yesterday I spent the whole day in my coupé. It had been a long time since my old Grison had seen one like it, so much so that very angry at being harnessed in this way, and completely against his habit, from morning to night, he nearly made me tip over at the corner of the Pont Royal. Despite this, I resumed my wanderings today. Do you want to come and see Thérèse, Alberte?
- Right away, Auntie," replied Alberte, rising to her feet.
- I'm going too," said M. de Valroux; "it's been two years since I last saw this brave Henri de la Croix-Sauvert.
- One of the pleasures of this absolutely nomadic way of life," said Madame de Valroux, pursing her lips, "is that friends and relatives no longer meet. Regimental life is a curse, it destroys family life.
- Madeleine, Madeleine," said the canoness, rising to her feet, "you don't understand noble slavery. I admire military life; I have only one criticism, and that is that it is absolutely unhygienic. You have to have a temperament of iron to go and breathe a new atmosphere every six months and move without transition from hot to cold countries. That's what exhausted poor Thérèse. I wish her husband would leave her with us for a while and go and live as a waiter in his new garrison. He may have five months. Is it worth taking this little girl and her three children to the dark land of beetroot? You're going to help me persuade Henri, Médéric. So I accept your arm.
"Madeleine, take good care of yourself, I'll send you a new invention, a paste that is supreme against sore throats.
Having said this, the canoness ceremoniously saluted Madame de Lextreville, who had played an almost silent role during her visit, and left on the arm of M. de Valroux, preceded by Alberte.
The two accomplices remained alone.
- This is a visit that leaves an unpleasant impression on me," said Madame de Valroux, speaking first. "I, who thought my aunt de Bonlieu was half conquered, have to listen to her praising the military heroism of Roger de Châteaugrand.
- An old woman's assessment," replied Madame de Lextreville scornfully. These good ladies of the beginning of the century like, in the midst of their rheumatism and sciatica, to remember brilliant uniforms and great feats of arms.
"The visit of this good and original canoness had quite the opposite effect on me, Madame. It is true that my silent role allowed me to make observations. From everything she said I conclude that we have not yet tried a very powerful means of discord between your sister and her so-called Frenchman.
- Which one?" exclaimed Madame de Valroux.
- Have you not heard that Monsieur de Châteaugrand is fanatical about the profession of arms?
- Well, everyone knows that.
- And didn't you tell me that your sister would already be Countess de Châteaugrand, were it not for her reluctance to lead the life of an officer's wife?
- That's for sure; this life, which I would find charming, displeases her deeply, and very often, when there was talk of a suitor, she began by saying: If he's an officer, don't talk to me about him.
- And that being the case, we did not think of the only thing that could cause a rupture between her and Monsieur de Châteaugrand!
- But what, madame? What?
- The resignation of Monsieur de Châteaugrand. Prepare the way, and, the day you see her leaning this way, inspire her to ask for his resignation.
- And if he does?
- He won't. I've heard a lot about him. He's obsessed with his career. On the other hand, Mademoiselle Alberte wouldn't be a woman if, denied this most important thing, she ignored it.
- Oh, you're right, a hundred times right," exclaimed Madame de Valroux. In the family we are so infatuated with Roger's military future that it has never, ever occurred to anyone to think of getting him to leave the military. I'm going to heat up the question. And if Alberte ever decides to ask Roger to make this supreme sacrifice, and if, as I firmly believe, he refuses to sacrifice his epaulettes to her, I'll get Mr David to address his request immediately, and there's a good chance that, with the help of irritation, it will be accepted.
- That's the true state of affairs," said Madame de Lextreville, rising to her feet. So far we've given a lot of swings in the water. Now we must join forces on this point, since it is Mademoiselle Alberte's weak point.
- Her real weakness, Madame. She's a homebody, her tastes are surprisingly simple, and she's very picky when it comes to relationships.
- I realised that," said Madame de Lextreville, biting her lips under her veil.
And she could have added:
- And that's why I'm working to ruin her happiness.
Madame de Valroux, realising that she had made a fool of herself by uttering those words which sink like a poisoned sword into the heart, got out of her predicament by saying more friendly things at the door of her salon and went back to her flat, saying:
- It's a good thing she's not sensitive, because she never gets angry.
And Baroness de Lextreville, for her part, as she slowly descended the grand staircase, thought:
- That little marquise, with her false bonhomie, plants some bitter truths right in your heart. I will make it up to her when, thanks to this thoughtless but honourable woman, I have separated these two disdainful beings whom I detest: Alberte de la Rochefaucon and Roger de Châteaugrand.
XI -- Great disdain
- My dear child, I don't ask for your news, your hand is burning and your cheeks are marbled here and there with red spots.
"You certainly have a high fever.
"I'm going to give you a prescription and even the ingredients for a refreshing herbal tea, which is excellent for that mood swing we call spring dizziness.
This is what the Canonsess of Bonlieu said to Alberte de la Rochefaucon, who had just been announced to her and whose upset face she was examining with deep attention.
- Aunt," replied Alberte, "I can assure you that I'm perfectly well and that I don't need herbal tea.
- You haven't come to ask me for a consultation?
- No, Aunt, not a medical consultation at least.
- Well, when they told me you were coming at this unusual hour, I thought: she's ill, she's coming to see me. Sit down, my child, and admit that you have a slight fever.
- I won't say no. Madeleine has just made a terrible scene, I got angry and, if Agnès hadn't cried so much at the idea of seeing me leave, I'd be looking for somewhere to live right now.
The truth is, I don't want to set foot in my sister's house again.
- La la, let's calm down," said the canoness peacefully. You mustn't get carried away, my child. No, no, no, you mustn't. In our world, head-butting is severely punished. It's agreed that you live with your sister, no one would understand if you left her before your wedding.
- But it's precisely this unhappy marriage that makes it impossible for me to live with her. Madeleine has it in her head that I should marry Monsieur Louzéma; if she could, she would force me to.
- That rich young Indian?
- Yes, Aunt, he is. Do you also think I should sacrifice Roger de Châteaugrand? Madeleine says that you completely share her ideas on this, and that's what I've come to find out.
Madame de Bonlieu nodded knowingly.
- It's a very delicate question; but in the end I can say that between this wealthy foreigner and a simple lieutenant in the dragoons, one can hesitate.
- Are you speaking sincerely, Aunt?
- Yes. Our century is above all a century of money, and you need a lot of it to hold your own.
What is this gentleman's fortune?
- I don't know the exact figure, it matters so little to me.
- There is talk of six hundred thousand pounds of income, that's tempting.
"Do you like him? That's the real side of a question like that.
- I like his sister very much.
- That answer is worthy of a place in the repertoire of feminine finesses. The sister, my dear Alberte, does nothing for the matter, especially when it comes to strangers.
- But she does, because we're going to live together.
- I'm told she left for Italy. Is she still there?
- Still there, having the time of her life, I hear.
In her last letter, she gave me a summary of one of her days. It's incredible. She does everything at once: balls, dinners, hunting. We'll see her again soon, as she tells me herself: two more months of this life and she's dead.
- These foreigners are mad about pleasure. But why did he stay in Paris?
Alberte lowered her eyes.
- It's all right, it's all right," said the canoness, "he doesn't want to leave, and he's quite right. There's a saying that absentees are wrong.
- Not for me, Auntie.
- Is Mr de Châteaugrand playing the absent man at the moment?
- Yes, I haven't seen him since Madeleine's ball. It must also be said that he is very busy. An officer is not free at all.
Madame de Bonlieu knocked on the small table within reach.
- Ah! that's what's detestable about this marriage," she said; "but perhaps you're not afraid of this horrible garrison life.
- Me!" exclaimed Alberte, "it's the only thing that separates me from Roger. Living on the roads must be torture.
- Yes, Alberte, a real torment. I said as much to my niece Thérèse when she wanted to marry M. de la Croix-Sauvert. The poor woman insisted on going to join her husband and lost a child in the North, thanks to the sudden change of climate. And now here she is in a foreign city, on her eighth move, with such sorrow in her heart.
"Since this last event, I don't encourage young girls who want to marry officers to come and see me. I say straight out: Don't marry them.
- Like Madeleine. Madeleine is overwhelming in this matter and our last quarrel came from there. She told me that her husband himself would only agree to my marriage to Roger if he resigned.
- That would be the best present he could put in your wedding basket.
Alberte lowered her head.
- Wouldn't asking him to do that be cowardly?
- No, in this day and age.
- It's costing me a great deal, Aunt.
- It seems to me that you are only exercising a legitimate right. This race to the bell tower across France is still very unpleasant for women.
- You don't know Roger, he loves his country passionately.
- We all do, my dear; it would be a shame if we old French families didn't love France. But does that mean we have to accept a life that is unpleasant and not at all to our taste? Of course not. First of all, you see, if you want advice favourable to Monsieur de Châteaugrand, don't come to me. Secondly, since I have seen my poor niece Thérèse suffer, since I have seen her and her children tossed from place to place, since I have learned of all the military tribulations, the petty jealousies of the regiment, I will never, ever, willingly let a relative of mine marry a young officer.
- Aunt, I see you also prefer foreign marriages," said Alberte, rising to her feet.
- What disadvantages?
- It's the foreigner," murmured Alberte.
- My dear, in this modern world, all the barriers have been lowered so much that with money you can be in any country you want. I don't suppose your suitor has any idea of sending you to live in Golconde?
- Madeleine claims that he will live wherever I want, but always in Europe.
- Well, my child, you will choose France. It is still beautiful and great, despite its downfalls and follies. There's only one country in the world, you see, and that's France.
And Madame de Bonlieu, rising in her turn, placed a kiss on Alberte's forehead, which was to say goodbye to her.
- Aunt, is my uncle de la Rochefaucon in Paris?" asked Alberte. Marie-Antoinette told me they were going to leave for la Rochefaucon.
- No doubt, the little hypocrite. Wasn't it necessary to prepare her father for the evil deed she was planning? She took him to La Rochefaucon, the cunning woman, and there, under the trees, she preached for her saint. The poor man, having already consented to his choice of vocation, hoped to keep his angel of a daughter for at least a year; but there, face to face, she was so eloquent that he allowed anything. I am told that she is entering Carmel this very day.
- Without warning!" exclaimed Alberte.
- She thinks we've been warned enough as it is and that we'd only be embarrassing, which is true.
- My aunt, goodbye, I'm off to my uncle's," said Alberte; "perhaps I'll arrive in time to embrace Marie-Antoinette.
- Oh, I don't know, it's all been plotted in the deepest secrecy and if, by the greatest chance, I learnt of her return from La Rochefaucon and her entry today, I have no idea what time the sacrifice will take place.
- It's still very early," said Alberte, "but it seems to me that I have a good chance of finding her if I go there right away. In any case, I want to give Madeleine time to recover from her great anger, and I may have the consolation of hearing someone from my family prefer French marriage to foreign marriage.
- These people will certainly prefer Monsieur de Châteaugrand; but they are still living in chivalrous times.
"The proof is that Enguerrand is giving his beautiful daughter to Carmel. In the eyes of strangers, I approve of their heroism, it honours us, that's for sure; but, apart from myself, I am enraged to see a charming woman, destined to be the ornament of the world, depart from it.
With these words of worldly regret uttered with full conviction, the canoness waved a graceful farewell to Alberte and left her.
In the courtyard, the young girl found the coupé that had brought her.
- Where are we going, mademoiselle?" asked old Morin, uncovering himself.
- To my uncle Enguerrand de la Rochefaucon.
Morin bowed his head and said very loudly the following address:
- Chez monsieur le duc de la Rochefaucon, rue de Varennes, 49.
Having said this, he climbed onto the seat and the carriage set off.
On arriving at the address, Morin took Alberte's orders.
Should we go into the courtyard, where there was a horse-drawn carriage?
- No, no," replied the young girl, "let the carriage stay here. It's my uncle's carriage, only the coachman isn't on his seat, it's the groom who's holding the horses, so I haven't a moment to lose.
"Morin, come quickly, my cousin might be leaving and I need to speak to her.
Having said this, she jumped onto the pavement, crossed the large cobbled courtyard quickly, climbed a staircase, put her hand on a magnificent handle of wrought steel and stopped speechless on the threshold of the door, which had rolled noiselessly on its hinges.
The great hallway, to which the grand staircase led, was full of flowers, and all the servants of the Duc de la Rochefaucon formed a hedge to the right and left of the iron banister.
At the very moment when Alberte turned the handle of the front door, a murmur went up in the vestibule and all eyes, red with tears, rose towards the landing.
Marie-Antoinette de la Rochefaucon had just appeared there on her father's arm, dressed in a toilette de ville.
Behind them, Alberte recognised the duke's married daughter and her son, renowned for his mad head and good heart.
The young girl slowly descended, lovingly squeezing her father's arm, which had been her softest support for so long. And he held her up, with nothing to betray the emotion that was tearing at her heart, nothing but the rigidity of his features.
At the bottom of the stairs, the beautiful Marie-Antoinette passed in front of the hedge formed by her servants, who were giving free rein to their grief.
She gave up her left hand to their kisses, smiled angelically and protested that she would not forget them in Carmel. For it was to Carmel that she was going, in her great and profound disdain for life.
She was voluntarily leaving that magnificent hotel steeped in glory and pomp for a poor cell; she was abandoning her loved ones for foreign sisters, she was stepping on her privileges of beauty, intelligence, birth and fortune to shut herself away in what men call eternal oblivion.
And she smiled, and behind that smile was a mysterious foretaste of the happiness she glimpsed beyond those dark veils called poverty, obedience and chastity.
At the door, she embraced her sister and brother, who were crying, and there, in this cruellest of farewells, she turned as white as a lily, but, like her father, did not let a tear escape her eye.
As she passed for the last time over her father's threshold, which her foot was never to cross again, she turned away, cast a loving glance at the old façade, then her eyes sought the sky.
At that moment, a hand grasped her arm.
- You, Alberte!" she said, turning away, "have you been warned?
- No, it was chance, or Providence," replied Alberte. Ah, cousin, why are you going so far away from us?
- So far away! I'll be nearby, at the Carmelite Convent of Saint-Denis, in the house of Madame Louise de France. I'm counting on your visit. And now, leave me alone, let me be with my father in these last moments, so painful and yet so sweet. I feel now that I have something to offer my God, the breaking of my heart.
"Farewell, farewell.
They kissed, and Alberte let her go to join the Duc de la Rochefaucon, who, absorbed in his immense grief, had not noticed his niece's presence on the porch. When the carriage pulled away, Marie-Antoinette took one last look at the hotel and gave her cousin one last smile.
Alberte wiped the tears from her eyes and walked sadly back to her coupé.
- And her advice?" she murmured, letting herself fall onto the cushions of the carriage; "she would have given me good advice, she who now sees so high and so far through detachment! Ah, she is very happy, my God, she is very happy!
XII -- At the children's party
The Easter celebrations in Paris were superb. The crowds of believers in the churches were the most eloquent protest against the anti-religious spirit which has the ambition to invade and destroy everything.
The time to leave for the countryside was approaching, and some families were already on their way home. For the Marquise de Valroux, this time came as late as possible.
Valroux is a very beautiful, isolated place where the Marquise de Valroux is bored to tears.
So it was decided that she would not leave Paris, which she loved, until it was clear to her that she had no one to see in Paris and nothing pleasant to hear in Paris.
To achieve her ends, she now has a ready-made pretext in the education of her children.
It's no laughing matter to hear her say to people who are surprised by her delays: "My son's education makes me less and less free to follow my husband to Valroux whenever he feels like it.
And it is no doubt as a complement to this education of a seven-year-old toddler that she is giving a children's matinee today in her large salons, which had been closed for Lent.
The party is extremely lively. All the cute creatures are having a ball.
Agnès graces her mother's salon with a truly charming grace, and she is assisted by her aunt Alberte, who is having a great time among the children. A few beautiful grandmothers accompanied the canoness of Bonlieu and a few young mothers formed the entourage of the Marquise de Valroux; but men were naturally very rare in the childish gathering.
Monsieur de Valroux made rare appearances from time to time; surrounded by a few dads of his kind, he laughed wildly at the conquering airs of his son and the eagerness with which his daughter was greeted by the tall schoolboys in short trousers and sailor collars, then disappeared with these gentlemen into his photographic studio. There was talk of reproducing a round led by Agnès, and he prepared the photographs. The surprise of the ladies gathered in the large salon was therefore extreme when they saw an elegant young man appear after John and walk towards them.
At the same time, Madame de Valroux and Alberte were hurrying into the adjoining salon to look after a baby girl who had fallen to the floor after being snatched by her escort with too vigorous a hand.
The young man asked for Madame la Marquise de Valroux.
- She will come, sir," said the canoness of Bonlieu, and suddenly recognising this untimely visitor, she added:
- Monsieur Louzéna, please take this chair.
He bowed, but remained standing, and when he saw the Marquise de Valroux coming forward, he walked briskly to meet her.
- Monsieur David," she cried, "how could you go astray at a children's ball?
- Madame la Marquise, I am indeed out of place in your salon today, but I didn't want to leave Paris without telling you the terrible news I have just received.
- Dreadful news, oh my God! But you are indeed so pale! Come with me to the blue drawing room, we won't be disturbed. But what if I called Alberte? Do you want Alberte for your confidence?
He bowed and replied:
- It's for her that I've come.
- Mr David, you're scaring me more and more! Why don't you go and wait for us in the small sitting room, that blue-fringed door over there, we'll be right there. I'm going to ask my Aunt de Bonlieu to take my place in the large salon; one of my friends will lead the rounds.
While David took the indicated route, Madame de Valroux went to tell Madame de Bonlieu that a very serious and very sad matter obliged her to leave for a moment, and that she asked her to receive the arrivals.
This done, she returned to the salon, where a round was being organised under the direction of Alberte, and, walking towards her sister, she took her arm and said softly:
- Come on, there's something terrifying going on at the Louzéma house. I won't tell you what; we'll find out.
And, without waiting for a question, she led him into the blue sitting room.
David was there, his elbow resting on the marble fireplace and his forehead in his hands.
He flinched at the entrance of the two ladies, greeted them and, without saying a word, handed Alberte an unfolded letter.
- Read it, Miss," he said in a distressed voice.
- Read it out loud," added Madame de Valroux.
And Alberte read the following short, pale note:
"My dear David, brother of my heart,
"You won't get a six-page letter today! I'm down with fever. Yesterday I wasn't well, but we were hunting and I didn't have the courage to give up riding my charming Pasquino. I went hunting, I danced and today, at the end of my tether, I gave myself up to Rika, who thinks I'm dead or very nearly so.
"It will be nothing, I promise you, in the future I won't be so crazy. I should have gone back to France, Alberte would have preached reason to me. She preaches so well, doesn't she, David?
"Tell her to write to me.
"Farewell... I can't take it any more, I can't see straight; farewell, brother, Rika comes forward with a bowl of herbal tea in her hand. Don't worry.
"Luna".
- The handwriting is very shaky," said Alberte with tears in her eyes; "Luna may be suffering more than she admits.
In reply, David presented her with a second piece of paper.
- A dispatch!" murmured Alberte, "from when, sir?
- Half an hour ago, by the time I got here.
Alberte opened the paper and read:
"Come immediately to Rome, Luna very ill, doctor worried.
"Carmen."
Alberte looked at David, her eyes streaming with tears.
- You are leaving, aren't you?
- Tonight, Miss.
- But you're probably exaggerating the situation," cried Madame de Valroux, "you don't die because you've danced and hunted too much.
- One dies of everything, madame.
- Ah, sir, how I pity you! Travelling in this state of anxiety is torture.
- You can telegraph us the news as soon as you arrive.
- Mr David, I beg you," said Alberte.
- I promise, mademoiselle.
He picked up his hat and took a step towards her:
- Whatever happens," he said in a deep voice, "must we return to Paris?
- Answer me," said Madame de Valroux, seeing her sister remain silent.
Alberte turned her head away, a sob rose from her heart to her lips; and holding out a hand that David shook respectfully, she replied:
- Whatever happens... yes... sir.
And as if she had said too much, she hurried out of the little blue room.
- Are you worried, sir?" asked Madame de Valroux as she accompanied David through the salons.
- Terribly, madame," he replied.
And lowering his voice, he added in his passionate voice:
- If I hadn't heard that last word from Mademoiselle Alberte, I would have left and never come back, madame. It was the pleasures of Paris, too exciting, too nerve-wracking, that began what Roman fever is completing. Luna was ill when she left for Italy.
Madame de Valroux smiled vaguely and shook his hands with the most expressive cordiality.
Then she returned to her place in the first salon with such a radiant countenance that the canoness, always on the lookout, said to her:
- Well, my dear, it seems that your bad news has changed its nature.
- On the contrary," replied Madame de Valroux dazedly, "but all the gall has been mixed with a real balm.
And leaning into Madame de Bonlieu's ear, she added:
- The sister is very ill. If some terrible misfortune were to happen, God forbid, the future would have a million annuities. Alberte has just committed herself.
- Please, Madeleine, please? And the consent of the head of the family?
"I don't suppose she can do without it, and I assure you that the Duc de la Rochefaucon is less and less inclined to let her have this foreign marriage.
- This is the least of my worries," replied the Marquise de Valroux in her impertinent tone; "I don't know that my uncle consults us about his own affairs, so we conclude ours without him.
- Madeleine, the leader in name and arms at least has the right to advice.
- I leave it to him, my God, I leave it to him; but if his advice doesn't suit us, we ignore it.
"Ah! he would be well advised to oppose Alberte's marriage to David Louzéma, who has a million in income, he who lets his beautiful Marie-Antoinette lock herself up in a convent!
"The world will not forgive him this horror, and well will it.
With that, Madame de Valroux went to find her daughter and hurry her to her father so that he could arrive quickly with his cameras.
And while Alberte wept in her room over poor Luna, victim, at least momentarily, of her disordered taste for pleasure, the children's circle formed in the large resplendent salon, and Agnès de Valroux, who was only wise in fits and starts, prefigured the worldly successes of the future by striking as coquettish a pose as possible in front of her father's camera.
XIII -- The return
Luna's illness had established a very active correspondence between David and the Marquise de Valroux, who was beginning to triumph all round. Alberte, caught up in it, let her heart blind her judgement and now saw David only through the eyes of the loving and kind creature whose memory filled her thoughts, and whose illness she followed step by step. At this moment, this strange illness came to a halt.
David's first letters, so gloomy and despairing, were followed by letters full of hope, which caused Alberte great confusion. David was well aware that what he wrote to the Marquise de Valroux would be read by his sister, and he cleverly took advantage of this unique opportunity to give free rein to his feelings and, above all, his hopes.
When these pages fell from Alberte's hands, she felt a deep anguish invade her heart. She had committed only one imprudence, she had said only one word, and here she was, dragged along, chained in a way, by this word that had escaped her in a moment of deep tenderness.
She tried to distract herself from the immediate consequences of what she had said, by concentrating on Luna and following her illness phase by phase in her mind. She told herself that once Luna was cured, she would regain the independence she wanted to keep until she came of age, when she would be free to choose her life's companion. But she is somewhat deceiving herself. This painful event had momentarily united her heart and David's in the same suffering, and kept their minds awake with the same anxiety. So now it's Roger who is in the background. David has made himself known, and Madame de Valroux can no longer be denied when she praises the fidelity of his affections and his devotion to those he loves.
David is no longer the enigmatic stranger on whom we dare not rely with confidence; David is Luna's devoted brother, the man of the heart who, leaving everything, pleasures and business, has gone to be his sister's nurse, and who, in his letters, alternately full of desolation and hope, shows his heart in a way bare and in this heart lets us see the image of Alberte engraved in fiery strokes.
Madame de Valroux, who possessed, in the absence of intelligence, one of those subtleties somehow sharpened by the wit of others, witnessed with ill-contained joy what she called Alberte's conversion.
At the moment, she can do without the advice of the scheming Madame de Lextreville and the help of Madame de Bonlieu. David's letters are a sufficient weapon, and she uses them with consummate skill.
In each of her own letters, which she read from one end to the other to Alberte with feigned sincerity, she slipped a piece of paper bearing these words: "Write always, write often, your letters are of an eloquence which becomes more powerful every day and which will no longer leave the enemy parties breathless."
Monsieur de Valroux was a silent witness to the change in his sister-in-law's feelings. His wife had repeated the little scene in the blue drawing room, amplifying it, and he realised that every time he uttered the name Châteaugrand, he caused Alberte considerable displeasure. He found things so advanced that he had been unable to hide his worries from Roger de Châteaugrand, who, thanks to a twenty-four hour leave, had come to ask him about Alberte's progressive indifference.
- My dear," he told him, "I can't conceal from you the fact that something strange is happening to my sister-in-law at the moment. In the past, she had unlimited confidence in you and was so suspicious of strangers that I couldn't imagine them being accepted. Now her confidence has shifted, thanks to her friend's illness, and I don't know what might happen. Despite everything, despite his feints, I don't think your case is hopeless. There is a heart in a woman that you can always count on.
- In any case, I cannot live with this perpetual torment," replied the young officer. When the deadline set by Alberte has passed, I will send my official request to the Duc de la Rochefaucon, and my fate will be decided.
- My dear, believe me, wait for the cure of the sister, which is long overdue, but which is predicted every day.
"There is a lot of the sister in this little change in Alberte's forehead, which, in the final analysis, should not arouse your jealousy too much.
This last argument had raised Roger's hopes a little, and Monsieur de Valroux, on leaving him, had said to his wife:
- You know, Madeleine, that Roger de Châteaugrand, in spite of all the love letters exchanged between you and David Louzéma in honour of Alberte, is not discouraged and will not give up any of his rights.
- His rights!" repeated the Marquise de Valroux ironically, "I'd like to know what they are.
As there was no way he could agree with his wife on this crucial subject, Monsieur de Valroux had stuck to this skirmish; but he had also found a way of telling Alberte about Roger de Châteaugrand's visit.
Alberte did not take up what he wanted to say on the subject. At the moment, she was entirely under the impression of a letter from David announcing that Luna was getting better and that her greatest desire was to return to Paris.
She can only get better there," he said, "and the company of Mademoiselle Alberte will be part of that cure. She was horribly tired of American evenings, and all she dreamt of was returning to our little hotel on the Champs-Élysées. This desire is becoming so compelling that it would be imprudent to thwart it. I'll take the doctor's advice, but as soon as we have his consent, we'll set off. We'll be eight days, if necessary, we'll make the necessary stops, but we'll get there.
She was rereading this paragraph for the tenth time, when suddenly her sister burst into her room.
- Alberte," she said, "come to my rescue. Do you think Médéric wants to take us to Valroux?
- It seems to me that we usually leave Paris on this date," replied Alberte, who didn't seem as unpleasantly moved by this news as her sister.
- Certainly, because he wants us to leave as soon as possible. He has to visit his cabbages and kill his rabbits; but this year there are a thousand and one reasons to stay in Paris. First of all, the theatres won't be closing, we've got some great evenings coming up; and secondly, Luna could arrive at any moment.
- Ah, Luna, that's right," said Alberte.
And she added, looking at her sister:
- Would it be generous of you to delay Médéric's departure for Valroux because of Luna?
- Are you going to feel for Médéric now? What! He'll let me stay in his damp woods until November and he won't give me the month of May in Paris! It's as if Médéric has sworn to confine me to boredom from now on.
"Ah, my dear, how happy you would be to marry a man with no country tastes and no preconceived ideas. Because Monsieur de Valroux has land that he loves, I have to go there every year. I don't like pastorals, I hate the smell of manure as much as moonlight.
"Let's see, frankly, don't you think that Médéric is becoming demanding beyond belief? I'm counting on you to tell him that it would be absolutely cruel to leave Paris when poor Luna arrives. She must find you in Paris, she must.
- However, if her arrival is delayed indefinitely, she won't find me there, and I can't involve my whole family in such an inconvenience.
- That would suit us all, except Médéric. Here's Agnès to give us her opinion. Sweetheart, come inside and tell us if you don't like Valroux better than Paris?
Agnès, to whom these words were addressed, slipped into her aunt's room through the half-open door and, with her hand on the crystal handle, replied with a wicked smile:
- I like Valroux much better, Mama.
Madame de Valroux looked at her in amazement and exclaimed:
- You deceitful little girl, you weren't saying that before.
The little girl took her mother's hand and, despite her resistance, kissed it.
- I said earlier that I liked Paris," she replied, "because I can see that Daddy will be angry too; but I can assure you that I like Valroux very much and that I have much more fun there than in Paris.
"Now, Mummy, would you like to go back to your room, Daddy wants to talk to you absolutely, absolutely.
- Alberte, come," said Madame de Valroux, turning to her sister, "I no longer feel strong enough to fight him alone, and, I repeat, because of Luna, you must delay this departure.
- We'll see what Médéric thinks," replied Alberte, who got up and followed her sister, on whose arm Agnès had hung like a small shield intended to cushion the effects of her husband's anger.
From her first glance at her brother-in-law, Alberte easily recognised that he had reached that point of irritation beyond which he would violently take back an authority that had been too softly exercised most of the time.
He paced the room, hands in his pockets and eyebrows furrowed.
When his wife entered, he retraced his steps briskly and said abruptly:
- My dear, if you don't want to give me a departure date for this week, I can tell you that we're leaving tomorrow.
- Why not today?" said Madame de Valroux with feigned gaiety, drawing new strength from her surroundings.
- Well, if you push me too far, I'll say as you do, Madeleine, why not today? replied Monsieur de Valroux in a harsh tone.
- Médéric, what date have you set for our departure?" asked Alberte, who saw fit to come between the couple.
- I warned Madeleine eight days ago that we would be leaving in the last few days of the week, and she told me that she hadn't prepared anything and that it was absurd to leave Paris at this time. I don't know what delights are keeping her there; but as far as I'm concerned, I've had enough, I think it's time to give Agnès and Maurice a breath of air other than that of the Rue de Lille, and I'm sticking to my plan to leave on Saturday.
- What do you say, Madeleine?" asked Alberte.
- But what do you say yourself? Isn't it partly for your sake that I don't want to go to Valroux? Your friend Luna is coming, and it would be ridiculous if she didn't find you in Paris.
- Is it absolutely necessary for you to see Mademoiselle Louzéma when she arrives, Alberte?" asked Monsieur de Valroux.
It was with a shade of embarrassment that Alberte replied:
- My God, Médéric, if I were free, I would certainly wait for his return. In her letters she shows a vehement desire, I can tell you, to find me. She has been on her way to Paris for a fortnight, as Monsieur David wrote to Madeleine.
"That tells you what this journey is like for poor dear Luna. She doesn't travel thirty leagues by rail without stopping for several days.
- And where is she now?
- In Culoz, on the border. She had to stop in these mountains. It seems that she is extremely weak.
- It's the same with all convalescences, Alberte, and you'll understand that if your friend imagines staying eight days in Culoz and taking another eight days to get back to Paris, I can't wait for her to arrive. I am needed at Valroux, and you know very well that your sister has already exhausted all her excuses for delay. Besides, who's going to stop you coming back to Paris? Once you're settled in Valroux, it won't be impossible for you to come and see Mademoiselle Louzéma, if she arrives.
- It won't be just one visit that Mademoiselle Luna will ask Alberte to make," said Madame de Valroux, who was following the conversation from the back of her armchair with marked interest, "it will be a series of visits.
Monsieur de Valroux looked fixedly at his wife.
- Do you think," he said, "that propriety will allow daily visits by Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon to the Hôtel des Champs-Élysées, where she will be received by a young man?
- You don't read David's letters, do you, Médéric? There is now an aunt, the widow of an English general who died in India, and it is she who is temporarily doing the honours of the house.
- You understand that as Mr David's letters are not written for me, I do not read them with the utmost attention," said Monsieur du Valroux, displeased at being caught at fault. All I see in this matter is the obligation to stay in Paris for an indefinite time. I would be delighted to please Alberte, I am full of sympathy for her charming sick friend; but for these sentimental reasons I cannot postpone my departure for Valroux. So tomorrow Saturday.
He interrupted himself, hearing a knock at the door, and said:
- What is it, John?
- A letter for Madame la Marquise.
- Give it to me.
Monsieur de Valroux took the letter, glanced at the handwriting and took it to his wife, saying:
- If I didn't know that Monsieur Louzéma was in Culoz, I'd swear that this letter, which hasn't gone through the post, is from him.
As he spoke, Madame de Valroux tore open the thick envelope. She read the contents at a glance and, passing the paper to her husband, said victoriously:
- Médéric, see if it's possible for us to leave tomorrow.
Monsieur de Valroux took the paper and read half aloud, but loud enough to be heard by Alberte:
"Madame la marquise,
"A sudden improvement, accompanied by a very energetic effort of will, has worked a miracle. I am writing to you from my hotel on the Champs-Élysées, from where I place all my compliments at your feet.
"David Louzéma".
- She's in Paris?" exclaimed Alberte in an explosion of joy. Oh, Médéric, how wonderful!
- Shall we go away tomorrow, Médéric?" asked Madame de Valroux in her persiflage.
- Why not? Alberte, I'm at your disposal. Would you like to come and see your friends straight away? You will have seen, with your own eyes, the state of Mademoiselle Luna. I undertake to take you back to Paris if necessary. Would you like to come straight away?
- Immediately," exclaimed Alberte.
- I'll give the order to harness up. How long will you need? Half an hour? A quarter of an hour? Ten minutes?
- Ten minutes, Médéric.
- That's fine," said Monsieur de Valroux.
And he left without glancing at his wife, who was biting her fingernails in annoyance.
- Alberte, you know," she said, "you don't have to put up with Monsieur de Valroux's tyrannies, and if I were you, I'd threaten to move in with one of my relatives.
"My uncle Enguerrand, the canoness and so many others would welcome you with pleasure.
- Madeleine, what advice are you giving me!" replied Alberte. After that famous scene about a visit I wanted to make to my Aunt de Châteaugrand, I threatened to leave you, and you told me that would be a disgrace in the eyes of the world. My aunt from Bonlieu told me the same thing. This made me realise the need for certain sacrifices, and I told myself that I wouldn't leave you, even if it meant suffering even more.
- But this time you have an excellent excuse, one that everyone will understand. I assure you that any sensible person will blame Monsieur de Valroux for wanting to imprison in his woods a woman who is not, by law, destined to be his victim.
- Madeleine, I really like the prison that Médéric is threatening me with," replied Alberte, smiling. Leave it to me. You want a few days' respite; if Luna is really suffering, you'll have them, I'm not afraid to say. Médéric is a very good man, but it's not wise to always break with him like you do. He gives in to you on so many points, why won't you give in to him on Valroux? You'll never take away his taste for the fields; I know that for myself, it's indestructible. But I'm lingering. Talking of which, why don't you come and see Luna with us?
- Médéric didn't suggest it.
- Now we'll have to invite you to take a seat in your own cars! Come along, I tell you, come along, you'll see for yourself what we can reasonably ask of Médéric.
Madame de Valroux didn't ask twice, and her husband was not a little surprised to see her arrive in the courtyard with Alberte.
- I'm taking Madeleine with me," Alberte said hastily. I don't know the aunt at all, and I can't be received alone by Mr David.
- Don't you count me for anything, Alberte?
- But if Luna won't see you!
- That's right and I approve of everything that's right.
Having said this, he offered his hand to his wife and Alberte to get into the carriage and gave the coachman the address of the little hotel on the Champs-Élysées.
XIV -- The brother and sister
The Louzéma hotel had returned to its accustomed appearance. The sun shone superbly on the long windows of a single room, there were flowers in the Etruscan vases on the stoop, and yet, when Alberte set foot on the threshold, she felt oppressed. There was something in the air that told her that the woman she had seen so happy and lively in this luxurious house had returned sick and sad. Servants were whispering, mysterious comings and goings were taking place. Doctors and friends came and went. Everyone came to find out the news, and when Madame de Valroux and Alberte climbed the stairs, they were preceded and followed by two groups of women. Monsieur de Valroux had gone to join the men, whom a servant was ushering into the ground-floor salons.
To Alberte's astonishment, it was not the faithful Rika who came to lift the heavy white-fringed door, but a French chambermaid, who replied, with an impertinent shrug of the shoulders, that mademoiselle would be obliged to suspend the reception and that she did not wish to receive these ladies. Madame de Valroux, disregarding this unpleasant remark, entered the room where a group of foreigners were chatting noisily.
Alberte slipped her name into the chambermaid's ear and, at the latter's signal from the back of the flat, moved towards the small salon adjoining the room with Madame de Valroux.
They tiptoed in and saw Luna half reclining on the sofa. An old lady covered in jewels was giving her a sniff of salts. Her large, tired eyes, half-closed, opened wide when Alberte entered, and, rising abruptly, said:
- I'm better, Aunt, I'm better," she said; "this visit will give me back my strength. Alberte, my dear, come and give me a kiss.
And Alberte, fighting back her tears, went to hug the exhausted body floating in the pink cashmere bathrobe, and tenderly kiss the dear, absolutely discoloured face.
- You see, they come together too much, they make too much noise," said the patient, holding out her hand to Madame de Valroux. They've made me terribly tired. You're going to give me a rest! But I must make the introductions.
"Aunt! Madame la Marquise de Valroux and Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
"Ladies! my Aunt Christine Lappleton.
"Otherwise I'll send Rika to close the door and I won't see anyone.
Mrs Lappleton, who seemed the best woman in the world, agreed to her niece's request and disappeared from the parlour, closing the door behind her.
- We're free for a few moments," said Luna, letting her pale head fall back on the cushions.
And, beckoning Alberte to come and sit down on the footstool to her right, she continued talking, pausing from time to time to inhale the invigorating essence contained in the crystal bottle that never left her side.
With her hand on Alberte's shoulder and her languid gaze fixed on Madame de Valroux, she recounted her stay in Rome and what she called her follies. She admitted that they had been great. Pleasure in every shape and form, parties without rest or respite. What had killed her," she said with her beautiful smile, "was no longer having David or Alberte as regulators, being alone in the midst of groups of friends who were fighting over her. She had lived twice, and made such imprudent mistakes that she herself trembled, now that reflection had become necessary with her illness.
She told how she had been struck by lightning, as it were, as she left the ball after a horse ride. She spoke of her brother's arrival, of his solicitude and attentions, and every time she pronounced the name David, her hand lightly pressed Alberte's shoulder, and she listened with some emotion.
Suddenly she stopped, exhausted and panting, and fell almost unconscious into Alberte's arms, who began to make her breathe in the salts from the bottle that had escaped from her hands and to lavish her with the tenderest caresses.
Entirely absorbed in the terror of this fainting spell, she did not see a door open and David appear in the doorway, dark and frowning.
Nor did Madame de Valroux, who was clumsily helping Alberte with her care of Luna, see him.
At last, bright colours returned to the young girl's white cheeks, and profuse perspiration beaded at her temples.
She smiled at Alberte, kissed her hand which was mopping the sweat from her face, and, smiling softly, called out:
- David!
David, seeing himself discovered, approached slowly and presented his duties to the ladies. Madame de Valroux greeted him with her customary alacrity, Alberte with a new-found sympathy. He must have suffered so much!
- Mademoiselle," he said to Alberte, "my sister obeys no-one but you. Advise her not to receive any more guests. The doctor forbids any fatigue, any emotion; she must obey the doctor.
- He wants to force me to lie down," said Luna plaintively; "those who love me wouldn't want to see me lying down.
- But you must," said David. You wouldn't have had a fainting spell if you'd had the ladies in your room.
- But not in my bed, David. Oh, you see, when I'm lying there, under my curtains, in broad daylight, it seems to me that all I have to do is order my coffin.
- It's just an impression, Luna, you can't count on impressions," said Alberte gently.
"Your brother is right. Just now you were burning up, sweating, but now you seem to have turned to marble.
- I've got the shivers, indeed," replied Luna, snuggling into Alberte's arms.
- Do you want me to call Rika and get you into bed?
- Is Rika here? And she smiled at the faithful slave who was crouching motionless between two pieces of furniture, completely unnoticed.
- Well, let yourself be looked after, please, go and get some rest.
- But, David, my room is full of people," said Luna with her graceful playfulness, "I've only received ten people and there are at least fifteen in my flat.
- I'm going to tell them that today's party is over; I have to go out, too, and I've said goodbye to these gentlemen.
- Well then, if Alberte wants to stay with me for half an hour or an hour, I promise you, David, I'll go to bed," replied Luna, wrapping her arms around Alberte's neck.
David looked at Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- Don't worry, sir, I'm staying," she said.
- Thank you, Luna, I'm leaving in peace, I'll find you in bed, won't I?
- Yes, David. But you know very well that being in bed at five in the afternoon gives me...
David leapt up to her and put his hand over her mouth.
- That's enough!" he said.
Luna took his hands between hers.
- Oh, you're cold too," she said.
And he answered with his big sad eyes:
- You're making a game of freezing the blood in my veins.
- No, no!" she said, "no, I don't want to make you suffer.
- So look after yourself, let yourself be looked after.
"And now I'm going to dismiss your visitors. Your room will be free in five minutes. Rika!
The next one rose obediently.
- Follow me to get everything ready.
- When will you be back, David? asked Luna.
- I'll be back for dinner... maybe.
He kissed her hand, greeted Madame de Valroux and Alberte and, followed by Rika, entered Luna's room, which had become a buzzing beehive.
He entered, hat in hand and with that sombre air that had struck Alberte.
Without bothering to answer all the questions he was bombarded with, he said in a serious tone:
- Ladies, my sister is still very weak, and she asks me to express her regrets, but she is forbidden to receive anything more today.
And, offering his arm to the old lady closest to him, he walked towards the door. The other visitors followed him to the bottom of the stairs. There he greeted them, shook their hands and ordered the carriages to move.
- Is Luna really sicker?" Carmen, the young Spanish woman who was Alberte's rival, asked him half aloud.
- No," he replied in the same tone, "but she's had a fainting spell, and it's advisable for her to rest. I assure you that it is impossible for her to entertain any longer.
- Except Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon," Carmen murmured loudly enough for David to hear.
And with that, she joined her mother as she got into the carriage.
David's response was to raise his shoulders and walk up and down the hall.
When the last carriage had passed through the entrance gates, he waved to the servant waiting for his orders. The servant brought him his overcoat, cane and hat, and he left the hotel on foot, heading for the Place de la Concorde.
He walked briskly, paying no attention to the people in his path. In the Rue Royale, he went into an earthenware shop and was shown some exquisitely graceful baskets. He chose one, ordered it to be decorated with flowers and sent immediately home to his sister.
This done, he made his way up the boulevards to the Maison Dorée.
In front of the famous restaurant, the pavement was crowded with curious onlookers. As David made his way towards the front door, he bumped into a young man who exclaimed:
- Here you are at last! Where did you come from? We haven't seen you for three months.
- Back from Italy! My dear Dragonneau," replied David, shaking the hand that was held out to him.
- They told me you hadn't left Paris.
- Paris is the city of lies. Where are you off to? I'm going home. I hate this movement on the boulevard.
- Let's go home," replied Monsieur Dragonneau.
And he followed David into a secluded room where the noise from outside was very muffled and where conversation was possible.
David, while giving his orders to the waiter who served their table, had taken a magnificent cigar case from his pocket and held it out to his passing friend:
- Would you like to renew your acquaintance with my cigars, Dragonneau?
- The best in the world!" replied M. Dragonneau, delicately pulling a blond londrès from its satin sheath.
"So, Louzéma, you've just come back from Italy. And why, forgive me for this indiscretion, have you brought back such a dark face from the land of the sun?
David fixed his sparkling eyes on the questioner, their expression somewhat savage.
- I've been indiscreet, I see," cried Mr Dragonneau.
- No," said David at last, "you are one of the sensible Frenchmen I have met, and besides, what would be the use of repeating my confidences? In a month's time I may no longer exist for you and a world may separate us.
- Do you have other travel plans?
David took his cigar from his lips and rested his forehead on his hand.
- Plans! I can't have any," he said. At the moment I'm waiting for destiny to decide. Don't you know that I'm bringing my mortally ill sister back from Italy?
- Why, that admirable young girl!
- Suffering from her imprudences and also from mine. She wasn't made for this fast-paced life; she was too delicate for this feverish existence, all pleasure, without rest or respite. I should have understood that. But I didn't. When I think of her, I am constantly reminded, like the most bitter of remorse, of that line by your great poet:
She loved the ball too much, that's what killed her.
- My dear David, you don't mean to say that your sister is in mortal danger?
David bowed his head and replied:
- I don't know.
But then he straightened up and dropped his clenched fist on the small marble table:
- What I do know is that I'll never love anyone again!
- Except Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon," said Robert Dragonneau, trying to smile.
David turned his gaze towards him, cold and sharp as a steel blade at the moment.
- I remember," he said, "you were the first person I spoke to about her.
- I was there when you first met in Paris, and it was very spicy. Since then, things have worked out well, because it's been announced that you'll be getting married soon.
- Have you heard?
- By twenty people.
- And that's acceptable?
- Perfectly. It is fashionable in our country to give a lot to foreigners, and on this occasion you are benefiting from it. Go and talk about marrying a la Rochefaucon to a Frenchman who does not have sixteen quarters of high nobility! You will be laughed at on the ground floor. But as you come from the ends of the earth, we won't worry about your parchments.
- Here are my parchments!" said David, tapping the right side of his paletot. I've got enough here to buy a lot of securities. Ah! I've got myself into a difficult business. Do you know that I'm not used to this kind of hesitation and slowness? Do you know that I'm a strict master, a real one, and that I command an army of slaves?
Robert Dragonneau, more and more surprised, looked with a sort of admiring astonishment at this little man suddenly transformed by the passion that made him speak.
- Do I surprise you?" he continued in his shrill voice. Ah, by Jove, I think so. You take people at face value! You see us imitating your grimaces and you think we've become monkeys of the same species. But no, no! There always comes a time when our instincts awaken, a time when this European life seems so bland that we return with delight to this other life which seems savage and horrible to you, but which I find superb, because there again, I am the master.
- I understand to a certain extent what you are telling me, David," said Mr Dragonneau after taking a sip of his scherry-kobler, "but I wonder why, disdainful of civilised life, you imagine marrying a European, a Frenchwoman, a Parisian.
- It's madness, my dear, I can feel it, the stupidest of madnesses.
- But you will do it?
- Yes, I will.
- Will you take Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon to your jungles for her honeymoon?
David bit his red lips.
- I don't know," he replied, "I don't like to reveal all my plans. You may scoff, but you must believe that it would not be a bad thing for a proud young girl to see at first hand the authority I enjoy in my domains. You persuade women in France so easily that a man is made to live at their feet that we foreigners are always afraid to marry a French woman.
- I am more and more surprised, in this case, that you have chosen precisely one of the Frenchwomen who is most accustomed to homage and least inclined to give up the respect to which she is entitled.
David shook his fuzzy head and replied:
- Some things are obvious. I can't explain to myself this madness which makes me, David Louzéma, play the role of a shy and passionate suitor. I've done it, there's no going back.
- And when did you get married?
- I have no idea. The situation is extremely tense, it has to be resolved soon one way or another. How will it be resolved? You'd have to be a bit of a mind reader to say.
"But that's enough of what interests me, and besides, I must leave you. I am going to consult an English doctor for my sister, whom I knew in Calcutta and who was said to be extremely skilful. I have just been given his address. I'm going to walk to him. Would you like to go for a walk?
And David stood up.
- I'm not free this evening," replied Mr Dragonneau. I've made an appointment with a friend of mine and I'll have to wait for him here. But I'll come and see you straight away and ask about your sister's health.
- Come along, you'll find me almost any time of day. I lead the life of a recluse and I am extremely tired of it. In Paris I need a dizzying life, otherwise I long for my hunting and my miners.
With that he shook hands with his companion and left.
M. Dragonneau, seated close to the glass front, stared for some time at this passer-by to whom no one was paying any attention, this little man with an ivory complexion and blazing eyes, and, dropping back onto the bench, he murmured:
- If Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon were my sister, this is a man she would never marry.
XV -- She loved the ball too much!
Everything was turned upside down at the Hôtel de Valroux. Boxes of all sizes and colours cluttered the landings. There was nothing but hammering under the sonorous ceilings. Madame de Valroux, whose nerves are frayed by all these preparations, has taken refuge in her sister's room to sulk at her husband, who has only agreed to delay their departure for Valroux by two days. Alberte went peacefully about her personal removal and occasionally gave a glance to Agnès and Maurice, who were not at all happy and organised a steeplechase in the corridor cluttered with small boxes for the particular use of the mistress of the house, who was in no way concerned by this hated removal.
- You don't seem any more upset than that," she said suddenly to her sister, "and I can't believe it, because at last you're parting with your friend just when your visits charm her the most and are perhaps the most necessary to her.
- I'm very, very sorry to leave Luna," replied Alberte; "but she's in such a strange state, it's so impossible to foresee any kind of outcome, that with her we fall into a state of indefiniteness.
- Finally, your visits give her great pleasure.
- Yes, but they bother me, because Mr David is always with her now.
- Well, isn't that his right? You see, Alberte, I find you appallingly ungrateful to him. If Mr David were to ask the proudest of our heiresses to marry him, he wouldn't agree to stand in the way he does in your honour.
Alberte did not reply, and this silence gave her sister great pleasure, as she continued:
- Did you say goodbye to Luna?
- Yes and no. Médéric promised to take me to her today, if we had time, so I said goodbye.
- You know that if you count on Médéric, you count without your host. He's been to his coachbuilder's and his harquebusier's, so he'll be here all afternoon. And he's so interested in these things that he'll forget all about the promise he made you.
- That would upset me. I wouldn't want to leave Paris without kissing Luna. She doesn't seem any sicker to me, everyone thinks she's better, except Rika. Have you noticed Rika, Madeleine?
- Who do you call by that name? Is it that frizzy-haired woman who's always lurking in the corner of the flat?
- That's the one. Oh Madeleine! How she suffers to see Luna suffer. It breaks my heart to hear her say in her guttural voice:
"Sick mistress, very sick.
- Is she talking to you?
- She said this as she squeezed my hand in her feverish hands.
Madame de Valroux burst out laughing.
- Your sentimental way of talking about this poor Indian girl is absolutely funny," she said.
- Laugh, Madeleine," replied Alberte gravely, "I never laugh at real suffering and I don't laugh at any devotion.
- Frankly, I don't think there's a woman among Luna's visitors who's noticed poor Rika, who doesn't speak or move much more than an earthenware dog.
- She loves, that's enough for me.
- Oh, you're full of the spirit of chivalry. But to get back to Luna, I can tell you that if you rely on Médéric, you won't have time to go and see her.
- I'd be sorry, I'd like to kiss her goodbye one last time.
- Well, let's work something out. I'll take you to her, if you like. I have an order to give to my milliner, and the longer I'm here the better, as I hate this messy house. I'm going to tip the workers to get them moving quickly. When I get back, I've got to stop hearing the hammering that's breaking my head.
"In a quarter of an hour I'll pick you up again, so be ready, because we've no time to lose.
Alberte replied by ringing her maid and asking for her going-out clothes. Madame de Valroux's preparations took longer than hers, and three o'clock struck at Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin as their carriage passed the church.
- I've waited too long for Médéric," said Alberte, "Luna's house is going to be full of her foreign friends; there'll be no way of getting a word in edgeways.
- And all these visitors will have frightened off Monsieur David," added Madame de Valroux, drawn, as it were, in spite of herself, into revealing the secret reason for her sympathies and indulgences for foreigners.
It was not without a mixture of astonishment and some concern that Alberte, on arriving in front of the little hotel on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, noticed that the courtyard was empty of carriages. She asked her sister to wait for her, crossed the courtyard, hurried up the staircase, and said to the servant who answered her doorbell:
- Is Miss Luna sicker today?
- Mademoiselle is better," replied the servant, "but she had so many people over yesterday that she gave orders to receive today only Madame la Marquise de Valroux and Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon.
- That's fine," replied Alberte.
She turned away, smiled at her sister who was looking at her through the open door and gave her a sign she understood, for the door closed and the carriage drove away. It had been agreed between the two sisters that Madame de Valroux would first go and talk to her milliner, then return to fetch Alberte and, at the same time, take leave of the young patient.
Alberte, reassured by the news from the servant, lightly climbed the beautiful interior staircase and knocked on the door of Luna's room. A yellow hand opened it, and Rika's plaintive voice asked in French:
- Who's there?
- Alberte de la Rochefaucon.
The door opened wide, then closed behind Alberte.
- Well, Rika, is your mistress feeling better?" said Alberte, speaking softly in the silent flat, darkened by the lowered blinds.
Rika took her hand and pressed it feverishly:
- My sick mistress," she said, "my dear, sick mistress.
Suddenly Luna's voice rang out.
- Who are you talking to, Rika?" she asked from the depths of her king-size bed. "Come and get rid of these suffocating curtains.
Alberte and Rika rushed together to the bed and opened the heavy brocade curtains.
Luna squealed with delight.
- Alberte, I was thinking of you. It seemed to me that you hadn't said goodbye to me properly, and no matter how much David assured me that he knew for a fact that you had left this morning for Valroux, I didn't want to believe him. Rika! Raise the blinds, I'm not sleepy any more, I want daylight, lots of daylight.
- Don't you want to get up a bit?" asked Alberte. So you go to bed fully dressed now?
- Yes; I get unpleasant chills. I get dressed, that is to say, I comb my hair and put on a dressing gown, and at the first sign of fatigue I throw myself on my bed. I feel a bit weaker these days, although better.
She straightened up, sat on her haunches and added:
- Sit here, Alberte, close to me. If you only knew how I've been dreaming about you all night. I wish you hadn't left me unless you were dead or cured.
- Cured! Cured!" repeated Alberte briskly. Get well soon, Luna, that's all I ask.
- Nor do I. Ah, that I should pay dearly for my past follies! Ah, how sad it is to be thrown down at twenty by a miserable chill!
She paused.
- I find you more oppressed today," Alberte ventured.
- A little: I had so many people over yesterday! But they're good to me, aren't they? If you only knew how kind all my friends have been! They've done what they could to distract me. We may seem light-hearted and indifferent in our world, but we have a lot of heart, Alberte, I assure you.
- I know that," replied Alberte, shaking his hand.
- Alberte! Take off your hat and gloves. It makes you look like you're on a visit. I'm not seeing anyone today, you know, for two good reasons. There's one you don't know, but I might be able to tell you. Rika! come and take Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon's hat.
Rika came over, took the hat from Alberte's hands, knelt down, rested her forehead on her mistress's right hand and, after this respectful caress, quietly left.
- Rika is quite tragic today," said Alberte, trying to smile.
- She's impressed," said Luna, resting her head on her hand.
- Why is that, Luna?
- Do I have to tell you, Alberte?
- Is it such a big secret?
- Oh yes, but I don't think it will upset you!
- Is it sad?
- For light-hearted or very happy people. For others it's a supreme consolation.
- Luna, you're speaking to me in riddles today.
- I'll give you the answer to this one. Has Rika gone out?
- Yes, she's out.
- That's very good. Poor Rika couldn't understand what I did. This morning her cries were so hoarse and wild that I felt sorry for her. Come a little closer, sit down... like this, put your arm under my pillow, it supports me and I don't need to raise my voice.
Dropping her head on Alberte's shoulder, Luna continued:
- Everyone, my darling, talks to me about recovery; it seems to everyone that my twenty years are reason enough for that; but I, Alberte, am under no illusions. I have gambled with my health, I have committed imprudence after imprudence, I bear the consequences and I know my illness better than anyone. And when I came back to Paris, where I am freer, where I have a thousand ways of doing what I want without David knowing about it, I longed for the consolation of religion. It was you, darling, it was you who opened my mind to this side of things, you know that well. I followed you to please you, I had taken to heart the famous project of which I will say a word later. Well! when the illness threw me to the ground, when there were no more possible distractions, when the theatre, the ball, the concert vanished, when solitude surrounded me, I thought of everything you had told me, everything I had heard. And I started praying again, saying my rosary with Rika, who is very fervent.
"But it wasn't enough and I couldn't do any more. David, who was leaving for India tomorrow to fetch me a forgotten diamond, howled like a tiger when I talked about getting a priest. My aunt, who had never seen a priest except at the death-beds of people who had been dear to her, opposed me just as violently. I was about to ask you to intervene, but I was afraid you would fall out with David by contradicting him. That's why I've taken steps on my own. Yesterday I got my aunt to go to the theatre with David; that poor aunt is bored to death in a sickroom. The priest came at ten o'clock in the evening.
She paused for a moment to take a deep breath and then continued, not without some effort:
- He came back at five o'clock this morning and I took communion, Alberte, and that's the real reason why I didn't open my door today. I didn't want to hear any nonsense or trifles, I wanted to remain in the deep peace of my heart. Because, I can't explain it to myself, my heart is at peace. There's a chasm between yesterday and today. I no longer fear anything, I no longer have any of those crazy terrors that used to prevent me from lying in bed in broad daylight. But I've also done things very well, because I haven't told you everything yet.
Alberte listened with great emotion to the accents of this beloved voice, which was becoming so deep despite its weakening, and when Luna added: I haven't told you everything yet, she felt herself shiver from head to toe.
- Speak quickly! Speak quickly!" she said, "Luna, you're frightening me.
- Alberte, you mustn't scold me! It's you who inspired me to have so much faith, it's thanks to you now that I live in hope and resign myself to God's will. And the best proof of this is that I've had myself administered.
- Luna!" exclaimed Alberte, "your fever is becoming delirious; you're delirious, aren't you?
- No, no; don't fidget like that, my dear, the slightest jolt hurts me, and keep your voice down, because Rika has returned, and listen to me all the way. It gives me pleasure to confide in someone, and who would I confide in if not you?
"So this morning, I thought that I wouldn't be able to get this holy religious to come back, and I also thought that I was sick enough to receive extreme unction. Don't cry, Alberte; I'm sick enough to receive extreme unction, but not sick enough to die. But after all, we don't know.
"The good father understood my concerns, examined me carefully and agreed to give me extreme unction.
"Well, what does it matter after all? I'm ready to be cured and ready to die. Rika was present at these ceremonies, without really realising what was going on. However, if you look at her closely, you'll see that she's still worried, very worried. If I get well again, Alberte, I'll teach my poor Rika as you taught me; I'll put something other than pleasure and coquetry into my life. Ah! if you were to become my sister, how easy everything would be for me! David and I would become French in sentiment as we are in sympathy. I don't think I've ever loved France as much as I do now.
She paused to cough.
- Would you like something, Luna?" asked Alberte, "You've got a strange cough this morning. Take one of these white pastilles. Would you like some?
- No, I don't want any! I'm sleepy, that's all. But if you like, Alberte, there's a prescription on the pedestal table and everything you need to make the only herbal tea I like. Prepare it for me, because Rika has been silly and stupid since this morning. Look at the gloom on her face as she listens to us. If I really do fall asleep, let me sleep, won't you, it's so sweet to forget. Alberte, kiss me. It seems to me that you are leaving me for a long time. Pull up this quilt a little, I'm cold to the bone.
Alberte did as she wished, kissed her tenderly and, seeing her drop smiling onto her pillows, went over to the pedestal table. Glancing at Rika, crouched in the alleyway beside her mistress's bed, her blazing eyes never leaving it, she thought it would be cruel to disturb her contemplation. So she read the prescription and set about making Luna's favourite herbal tea, without hurrying.
From where she stood, she could see Luna in a deep sleep.
Suddenly her hands stopped trembling and she let slip the gilded spoon she was twirling in the golden bowl. Rika sat upright on her cushion, raised both arms above her head and let out a wild cry of pain that echoed throughout the house.
Two doors opened simultaneously in front of David and Mrs Lappleton,
- You're mad to scream like that," cried the aunt, "you'll frighten the child.
- Luna!" cried David.
And he rushed to the bed, fixed his fiery gaze on the face of his sister, who was still smiling, took her in his arms and cried out:
- Dead! She's dead!
An indescribable uproar followed this terrible discovery. The servants, in defiance of all etiquette, entered the room; all that could be heard was sobbing, interspersed from time to time with the wild, heart-rending cry of Rika, who held one of her mistress's hands to her lips.
The dreadful news was telegraphed and soon became known to neighbours and friends.
An express was sent to the doctor.
The house filled with sincerely distressed women. David, desperate and fierce at the same time, refused to believe in such a sweet and swift death. The doctor destroyed the glimmer of hope he wanted to keep. The accident he had feared had happened. A blood clot had stopped in the pulmonary artery and Luna had died of suffocation.
Madame de Valroux arrived in time to drag Alberte from the room where her heart was breaking with pain, and where the distressing cries of the faithful Rika were resounding.
She led her sister into a sitting room on the ground floor and left her there while she went to offer her personal consolations to the unfortunate David.
In spite of her casual appearance, Madame de Valroux bore the appalling event very lightly, and did not lose sight of any of her petty intrigues.
Taking advantage of the annihilation into which Alberte had fallen, she went with her, but without making her leave her carriage, on various errands and visits, the main purpose of which was to make it impossible for her to leave that evening. Among others, she had herself dropped off at Madame de Lextreville's, where she stayed only long enough to break the painful news, and where she was greeted with a warm welcome.
- This misfortune, this terrible misfortune, doubles the fortune of our suitor," exclaimed Madame de Lextreville, "we must not delay the proposal of marriage any longer.
- Rest assured, madame, everything will be done wisely, and, it must be said, everything is in our favour at the moment. Alberte witnessed Mr David's first outburst of grief and is now busy feeling sorry for him. I shall make good use of this great compassion if M. de Valroux will let me.
- Mr de Valroux, in this matter, has always represented non-intervention to me, Madame. Since he will not intervene, he is not to be feared.
- I fear him less now; I tell you frankly, I am full of hope. Farewell, farewell! Within a month there will be news. Alberte will not be married, but engaged, and that fills me with joy, even in the midst of this appalling misfortune.
With these words, Madame de Valroux took her leave and returned to her carriage, where Alberte was crying, unmoved by anything.
This time the carriage took the road back to the hotel, where it arrived just after six o'clock.
Mr de Valroux was strolling up and down the courtyard. When the carriage appeared, he went inside and waited for his wife in the vestibule:
- Madeleine!" he said with contained anger, "you've managed to make us miss tonight's train. But I want you to know that I'll be leaving with my children all the same, and that you'll be at Valroux tomorrow. That's how I'll act from now on, when...
He stopped abruptly. Alberte had arrived, her face shattered and bathed in tears.
- What's going on here? What's going on?
- Médéric, Luna is dead," sobbed Alberte.
M. de Valroux had a good heart. He turned pale and ran to offer his arm to his sister-in-law, who was staggering on her legs.
- Are you leaving this evening, Médéric?" asked Madame de Valroux as she came up the stairs ahead of them.
- Alberte, would you like to stay a few days longer?" asked M. de Valroux. Would you prefer to leave Paris?
- No; I'd like to stay until the last goodbye.
- Very well, then. I'm only going to send the heavy luggage. They'll be waiting for us at the Valroux station.
- If, however, you absolutely insist on leaving this evening, Médéric," said Madame de Valroux in her impertinent tone. It costs you so much to give in to other people's wishes!
- Not when death interferes, Madeleine. Here, know this well, I only give in to death.
"Alberte, go back to your flat, your sister will give orders for dinner to be served there. You need rest and solitude to recover from this blow which, in truth, is devastating.
Alberte thanked him with a look and returned to her room, while Madame de Valroux went to supper with her children.
XVI -- The decision
- My niece, I have just learned of your return from Valroux. I have come to pay my respects and also to deal with some very delicate matters that are better dealt with verbally than in writing.
- What business, uncle?" asked the Marquise de Valroux, smiling at her uncle Enguerrand, who was kissing her hands. If they concern Médéric, I regret to say that he is not in Paris.
- Didn't your husband come with you, Madeleine?
- That's a bit scandalous for you, isn't it, Uncle, and rightly so, I assure you. But when Médéric is at Valroux it would take a catastrophe to get him out. He was very happy to find me on this occasion. Just think: one of his aunts, who lives in Rouergue - Rouergue, I must repeat that word - is coming to show her daughters around Paris and has asked me to drive them. Médéric had fits of despair. He set off on his holiday. He was dressed head to toe in coutil, with a frightening tan, and he loathed Paris.
"Seeing this, I devoted myself to you, and here I am for eight days in Paris with Alberte.
- Alberte is coming with you?
- Yes. There are two young girls, and we had to create a pilot for them.
- Since Alberte is in Paris, the matters I've come to talk to you about can still be dealt with, as they concern her personally.
- Is this about Alberte?
- Yes. She turns twenty-one in eight days' time, and I have her guardianship accounts here, as well as two marriage proposals sent to me on the same day.
- Two!" exclaimed Madame de Valroux in deep astonishment, "two at once, uncle?
- Yes, both. The first in date order is signed by Monsieur David Louzéma and is annotated with a very brilliant statement of fortune which...
- I know, I know," interrupted Madame de Valroux, "that one doesn't intrigue me, I know that one inside out; it's the other one. Whose is the other one, uncle?
- Count Roger de Châteaugrand's.
And M. de la Rochefaucon passed to Madame de Valroux, who burst out laughing, two letters which she flipped through quickly.
- Oh, this is high comedy," she exclaimed, "everyone knows that M. de Châteaugrand has been asking for Alberte for a long time.
- This is the first time I have received his official request," said the duke in a serious tone.
- Ah, no doubt he saw that there was nothing more to say to us, to us, Mr de Châteaugrand, in truth, a poitrinaire... an officer.
- Eh! eh! my niece, how you go. Here is a suitor who obviously does not please you. But, as far as I am concerned, I cannot let it be said in front of me that Roger de Châteaugrand is a poitrinaire, nor can I reproach him for being an officer.
- Would you, my uncle, consent to a woman of our blood running from garrison to garrison, mixed up with all the plebs invading the army?
- My niece, the army remains sacred for every good Frenchman, and bearing the sword in the name of France will always be an honour, unless God in his anger gives us governments inept and cowardly enough to use this sword of France for dishonourable tasks.
- Whatever you say, uncle, I don't want Alberte to lead a wandering life, I prefer David Louzéma to Roger de Châteaugrand.
- You have your opinion, my niece, I have mine, but that doesn't really matter. Shall we ask Alberte's first?
Madame de Valroux stood up.
- If you don't mind, Uncle," she said, "I'm going to see if she's in her flat.
- Come on, Madeleine, in a matter of this gravity, nothing should be rushed.
Madame de Valroux inclined her head in assent, rolled a small table covered with brochures and newspapers over to her uncle, and went up to Alberte's room.
She found her sitting at her little marquetry desk, an unfolded letter in her hands.
- Alberte," she said, "are you in the mood to receive the Duc de la Rochefaucon, who, having learned of our arrival in Paris, is hastening here to talk about guardianship and marriage?
- Is he asking for me, Madeleine?
- Yes, but if you don't want to come down, I'll invent a pretext. Who is this letter from?
- From my aunt de Châteaugrand.
- What is the subject of your renewed correspondence?
- About Luna's death. My aunt is so full of heart that she didn't want to be the last to sympathise with my grief.
- It was extremely political.
- Madeleine!
- Eh! no doubt. I don't share your views on the Châteaugrands, and I don't believe in the disinterestedness of these condolences. I believe it even less because the Countess de Châteaugrand is proposing marriage to your guardian this very day.
Alberte turned pale with shock.
- I understand that they're tired of waiting," she murmured, "and after all, I'll be of age in eight days.
- So I'm free to escape the advice of your uncle, who has a second marriage proposal signed by David Louzéma.
- Madeleine, you inspired this one," exclaimed Alberte.
- I certainly did! What do you want me to say to poor David, whose despair is only increasing?
- Is he still in Rome?
- Yes, he's been writing from Rome. He's collecting all the memories that Luna left in the flat she wanted to keep. He won't be back until he hears from you. If it's unfavourable, he won't come back at all.
- Is he still in pain?
- Yes. He leads a reclusive life in Rome, the life we lead at Valroux, where he still believes us. Today's post will probably bring me a letter. I won't be changing my address, since Médéric is only giving me a week's leave, and it's from Valroux that I hope to write him my final yes.
Alberte pressed her forehead in both hands.
- Oh, what an alternative!" she exclaimed. I know that my answer will break one or other of these hearts, and I am horribly unhappy about it.
- Monsieur de Châteaugrand will be consoled by his mother, whom he idolises, and, in that respect, I would not like to marry a man with such a mother. David Louzéma has no one, and you are rescuing him from the most dangerous temptations.
- It's strange, but it seems to me that Roger in particular will suffer," murmured Alberte.
- How can you think that, Alberte? Monsieur de Châteaugrand is at ease in Mantes with the mother who is so dear to him, while poor David, locked up in his flat in Rome where his sister fell ill for the first time, feeds on her tears and regrets.
- Oh, I pity him with all my heart, with all my heart, Madeleine.
- It's not a question of pitying him, it's a question of consoling him. With your romantic tendencies, I am surprised not to see you immediately prefer this afflicted man to Roger de Châteaugrand, who loves you so little that he cannot bring himself to leave the army.
- I never formally asked him," says Alberte.
- Formally is exquisite. Aren't these things only half hinted at?
"First of all, I didn't hide from him the repugnance I would feel at seeing you running from garrison to garrison. If he had loved you as David does, he would have resigned a long time ago.
- His resignation! That may well be the touchstone," murmured Alberte, rising to her feet. I'm going to find out what my uncle de la Rochefaucon thinks about this.
- You know that he is naturally hostile to David Louzéma," said Madame de Valroux, blocking his way; "you also know that, as head of the family, he would not like to see himself left behind in terms of fortune, and that David Louzéma's million in income could inspire in him a certain amount of spite, which would be quite natural.
- I know, I know that he is concerned about the honour of our family and the destiny that awaits us," replied Alberte, "and at the moment of entering into such a commitment, especially with a stranger, I must take his advice.
- Come," said Madame de Valroux, turning on her heel, "you are allowing me to accompany you, aren't you? I have to go and defend the interests of my poor desperate man.
And she preceded Alberte into the small salon where the Duc de la Rochefaucon was sitting.
The duke listened with a smile to Alberte's stammered thanks for her great kindness in looking after his affairs of every kind; then he got down to business.
He commented on two or three papers covered in figures, and made an appointment with Monsieur de Valroux for the last guardianship settlement.
He slowly read aloud the two letters: one from David Louzéma, dated Rome; the other from Roger de Châteaugrand, dated Nantes; then, taking a pencil case from his wallet, he said:
- Now, my niece, please dictate my answers to me, I am only your secretary in matters so delicate and which touch so closely on the happiness of one's whole life.
- Uncle, please give me your opinion first.
- You know my opinion, Alberte; I support Roger de Châteaugrand's request with all the influence I can bring to bear on you.
- And I support Mr David Louzéma's," retorted Madame de Valroux.
- While advising me to marry Mr de Châteaugrand, my uncle, would you disapprove of me marrying Mr Louzéma?
- I would oppose it if I still had the right to do so, yes.
- Just as I would oppose your marriage to Mr de Châteaugrand," exclaimed Madame de Valroux, fighting tooth and nail for her partner.
- You understand, Uncle, my embarrassment is extreme," said Alberte, "I don't know how to get out of an indecision that the various members of my family keep up as if for pleasure.
- Alberte, I don't want to violate your freedom of choice, but I thought that you had a long-standing affection for Roger de Châteaugrand.
- Indeed, uncle.
- Madame de Châteaugrand has always set her heart on Alberte as a daughter-in-law," added Madame de Valroux.
- And I considered it a joy to become one," murmured Alberte.
- So what's stopping you from accepting this loyal and faithful heart?
- I have only ever had one reproach for Roger," cried Alberte: "his career.
The Duc de la Rochefaucon frowned and shook his head painfully:
- It has come to this," he said, "that a la Rochefaucon does not want a husband who carries the sword of France!
- Uncle, allow us to consider this question from its true perspective," cried Madame de Valroux. Nothing is more tiring, more insipid than nomadic life, garrison life. Nothing more painful in wartime, nothing more painful in peacetime, than obligatory relations with women who are sometimes horribly vulgar.
"I completely agree with Alberte, you don't marry a lieutenant any more.
- Roger de Châteaugrand is the wood from which generals are made, my niece.
- And in the meantime, Alberte's life would be spent waiting. Ambition, that ambition at least, is no longer fashionable among us. It is going, uncle, I assure you it is going.
- Along with many other things, alas! But let's get back to our main business. Alberte, please dictate to me the answers I must make to these two letters. First of all, have you made up your mind?
- Not yet, Uncle, not yet.
- What should I say to the Countess de Châteaugrand?
Alberte remained silent for a moment, blushing and turning pale in turn.
Madame de Valroux looked at her with growing concern. Was she going to destroy with one word the scaffolding so laboriously, so patiently erected?
- Uncle," said Alberte at last, "please write to my aunt de Châteaugrand what I have often insinuated to her in my letters: my repugnance for military life is only growing. I will not marry an officer.
Madame de Valroux clapped her hands discreetly. Alberte had fallen for it.
- Is your resolution irrevocable?" asked M. de la Rochefaucon, extending the lead in his gold pencil.
- Yes, uncle.
- So I'll write.
And the duke began to write that the first present Roger de Châteaugrand should drop into the wedding basket would be his resignation as lieutenant of dragoons.
- Yes, uncle.
- And that without this major condition, his request would not be accepted.
- Yes," replied Alberte more faintly.
- Very well, then. Now for the other one. What should I say to Mr David Louzéma? I insist in particular.
And the Duke took the other letter and prepared to write on the back.
- Alberte! are you going to hesitate again?" cried Madame de Valroux; "in the terrible state poor David is in, will you have the courage to postpone your reply?
- But, Madeleine, it is impossible for me to do otherwise. Firstly, I have to wait for the Countess de Châteaugrand's reply, and secondly, I have to give Mr David's great grief, which you know I deeply share, time to soften a little.
- This last reason should lead you to give him something other than the vague hope with which he has so often been lured.
- From the terms of this young man's letter, it looks as if he has come to speak for sure," remarked the Duke.
- We have seen him so long, uncle," replied Madame de Valroux, "we loved his sister so much! And then judge, a million in income! the unattainable in terms of fortune.
- This party does indeed recommend itself by its fortune, but it would be good to know how it recommends itself in other respects.
- But we know Mr Louzéma, Uncle, we know him inside out! What surprises me is Alberte's hesitation.
- And does mine surprise you too, Madeleine? As your guardian, I do have some say in the matter, and I haven't yet accepted this foreign face.
- What do you want to say to M. David?" said Madame de Valroux, excessively annoyed by the tone in which her uncle had spoken these words.
- Uncle, did I really come of age on the 16th of this month?
- Yes, that very day I handed in my guardianship accounts.
- Well, on the 17th I'll be making a final decision. Please write to Mr Louzéma that special circumstances prevent me from giving a definitive answer today, but that he will receive a definitive answer on the 17th.
- And, as I hope it will be favourable," replied Madame de Valroux, "I reserve the pleasure of telegraphing it to him.
- I shall reply in this sense to your two pretenders," said the Duc de la Rochefaucon as he rose, and, taking Alberte's hand between his own, he added:
- I am going straight to Saint-Denis and will recommend you to the prayers of Marie-Antoinette.
Alberte thanked him with emotion and went to lead him to the salon door. She returned slowly, with her head bowed, to her sister, and when she asked if she would accompany her to the Bois where she was going to take her children, to create a diversion:
- No," she replied, "I won't let them see me change my mood.
- Your mood has changed?
- Yes, Madeleine, I feel sad, even sadder than usual, because it seems to me that I have just committed a cowardice.
XVII -- Victory!
- Madame, madame, where are you going?
"Your name, please...
And the concierge of the Hôtel de la Rochefaucon sprang from his lodge in the footsteps of the Baroness de Lextreville, who was crossing the courtyard with a deliberate step.
- Is Madame la Marquise de Valroux no longer in Paris?" she asked, disdainfully turning her head away.
- Madame la marquise is just passing through, madame, and is not receiving visitors today.
- Except for the people to whom she has written to come and see her, I suppose," replied the little baroness.
Shrugging her shoulders, she continued on her way and, to the great astonishment of the concierge, who had obviously received orders to the contrary, she was ushered into the hotel and taken to Madame de Valroux's flat, in the very room where she was having various toilettes displayed, between which she was still hesitating.
- Ah, it's you, Madame," she said, laughing. "Have I intrigued you enough with my enigmatic note this morning?
- Frankly, madame la marquise, I find you mischievous...
"How could you write to me about something so exciting?
"There is nothing more to hope for and nothing more to fear. Come and find out the result soon, I don't get out until three o'clock.
Madame de Valroux laughed even louder and led Madame de Lextreville to a sofa near a window.
- Come, let me tell you about it," she said. I couldn't resist the pleasure of telling you about it in person, and that's why I wrote you this enigmatic note. Guess how things turned out.
- I don't dare hope for success, and yet your triumphant face proclaims that it is Mr David who has won.
- Well, yes, well, yes. I'm stunned myself by such success.
- Has she really decided to go abroad? Tell me quickly, Madame, tell me quickly.
- If you don't mind, we'll proceed in order," said Madame de Valroux, who was enjoying her news. Have I told you about the visit of our uncle, the Duc de la Rochefaucon?
- No, but it was planned, since you had asked him to propose marriage.
- Unfortunately, by a very unfortunate coincidence, Madame de Châteaugrand also proposed marriage to her son.
- What a strange coincidence!
- So peculiar that if Monsieur de Valroux hadn't been at Valroux, I would have accused him of having leaked our plans, which he is very incapable of doing.
- Forgive me, but I thought Monsieur de Valroux was the natural ally of Monsieur de Châteaugrand.
"You don't confide anything of your personal plans to him?
- I am usually excessively cautious. Nevertheless, you understand that I cannot keep up a correspondence with a young man without Monsieur de Valroux knowing about it; he opened all Monsieur David's letters, and he read the one in which he thanked me warmly for my advice and warned me that he had just acted on it. So here was my uncle, as an adversary, of course, submitting the two letters to Alberte and asking him how he should respond to them. I was on pins and needles. I was well aware that my sister was feeling her great pain and that Mr David, as the brother of that poor charming Luna, appeared to her in a most sympathetic light. But it was a long way from saying yes.
- Did she cross it?
- Just about, by demanding Roger de Châteaugrand's resignation.
- And he didn't resign?
- He did! He wrote my uncle de la Rochefaucon a heroic four-page letter, which made Alberte weep. I proved to her by A plus B, as my cousin the mathematician says, that she was only second in the affections of M. de Châteaugrand and that she had a sovereign rival in the epaulette.
- So... Madame, please finish quickly.
- So she let herself be indoctrinated and said that everything was over between Roger and her. Taking advantage of this, I took David's cause in hand, I showed him to be wild, desolate, no longer expecting any happiness except from her. He wrote to me - you understand that he was kept informed - the canoness got involved, the million dazzled him a little, and this evening Alberte is going to declare her intentions to the Duc de la Rochefaucon, who is still resisting, we really don't know why, purely for form's sake no doubt.
"This evening, after dinner, we go to her house, Alberte declares her intentions, we obtain my uncle's consent and we finish the evening at the Opéra, where M. de Valroux's cousins absolutely must set foot before leaving Paris. Tomorrow we set off again for Valroux, where I will summon M. David by dispatch, and there will be only one thing left to do: set the date for the ceremony.
Madame de Lextreville dropped both her arms in an expressive gesture.
- My arms are falling off," she said. How did you manage to move so quickly on such a difficult matter?
- By doing my best to make the most of this dreadful event, so painful in itself. Every cloud has a silver lining, you know. If I have to tell you everything I think, I think Mr David is more consoled than he lets on, and that he is perfectly bored in Rome.
"But when I read his letters to Alberte I added my own, and you should have seen her turn pale and weep! What I put into this affair is unbelievable.
"Poor Alberte's marriage will not be a marriage of interest, she despises money; nor a marriage of convenience, there is none; nor a marriage of inclination, she does not love David for himself: it will be a marriage of... how shall I put it, of commiseration. how shall I put it, of commiseration.
And Madame de Valroux began to laugh wildly.
Madame de Lextreville merely smiled, but there was a terrible expression of satisfied malice in her smile.
- It's a beautiful marriage in any case," she continued, "and in a few days your sister will be grateful to you for having made her so resolute against the claims of M. de Châteaugrand.
- That is my hope. And I also hope to persuade her to buy a huge piece of land near Valroux, the price of which frightens everyone. At this château, they will have to give parties, unless they condemn themselves to dying of boredom, and, in the end, she will be able to give some very nice ones. I don't understand what a holiday means unless it includes a whole range of pleasures: balls, hunting, comedy. There is a comedy room in this princely castle. I'll try to get him to put it in his basket. I have already spoken to her about it, and however disinterested she may be, she is not insensitive to the thought of resuming the grand lifestyle her family once enjoyed.
- At last the thing is done," said Madame de Lextreville, rising to her feet, "and I am delighted. I like to know that insolent Count de Châteaugrand is very unhappy.
- Well, I don't. Since I obtained this unexpected success, I sometimes give poor Roger a fond memory. Ah, that's because he loves her as few women can boast of being loved.
- Madam, if that were the case, he would not have shrunk from resigning.
- I don't understand it, I can't explain it, and I never will.
"Are you leaving me? Well, I bid you farewell until the supreme day.
"We leave again tomorrow for Valroux. There I shall find the letters of the unknowing fiancé, who has no idea that I have left Valroux. Farewell, farewell.
Madame de Valroux, to escort Madame de Lextreville back, had taken a few steps into the wide corridor, and seeing a carriage entering the courtyard through a window, she said:
- This is your carriage, no doubt coming to fetch you.
- I came on foot, Madame.
- I didn't know: in fact, it's just a carriage. A gentleman got out with a suitcase in his hand.
"Who could that be?
"Ah, but it's Monsieur de Valroux himself. What an adventure! My husband is definitely the most original of men! He refuses to come to Paris when we all beg him to, and he arrives when he is not asked.
Madame de Lextreville approached her.
- Won't his presence have a bad effect on this evening's declaration?
- No, not at all. He knows perfectly well the change in Alberte's face. He hasn't said a word of protest. Rest assured, you can rely on me to remove any obstacles that may arise.
And with that, she held out her hand to Madame de Lextreville, who went down one flight of stairs, while Monsieur de Valroux went up the other.
- Médéric, it's you in that elegant outfit!" exclaimed Madame de Valroux, who was waiting for him, leaning against the banister. You haven't had the patience to wait for us for three days?
- My dear, I didn't lack patience," replied Monsieur de Valroux, who, after kissing her, followed her into his flat; "but when you were no longer there with your perpetual contradictions, I reflected coldly on what I had done, and I feared, but I feared very seriously, that Madame de Valroux would be angry at my lack of embarrassment.
- You are a thousand times too good. Your aunt and your cousins are having a wonderful time without you.
- They haven't made any unpleasant remarks about me?
- They haven't mentioned you. I assure you they are the most independent and peaceful of characters. They're out all day, and as long as Alberte and I take them out in the evening, they don't ask for anything more.
- Speaking of Alberte, I bring you a whole letter from Italy.
"Well, what did Madame de Bonlieu's tea produce? Has the Duc de la Rochefaucon surrendered?
- We'll find out this evening; we're only going to Madame de Bonlieu's this evening.
"Will you be one of us, since you are there?
- Unless you fear that my presence will dampen your enthusiasm.
- Oh, rest assured, I'm not afraid of anything. You know that when Alberte wants something, she wants it well, and since she has chosen David Louzéma, nothing will make her change her mind.
- He's been chosen... completely?
- He's accepted; tomorrow morning I'll telegraph Alberte's consent. We are only waiting for the Duc de la Rochefaucon's consent as a matter of form. Why do you want him to oppose my sister's marriage? All we have to do is remind him of his Carmelite Marie-Antoinette. What a horror!
- I thought your uncle was holding out for Roger de Châteaugrand.
- Perhaps; but my uncle is too much of a red heel not to resent Roger de Châteaugrand's rudeness.
- His rudeness! Him?
- Isn't it rude to reply to a woman who only asks him for a poor little resignation in order to marry her, to reply, fist on hip, that he won't give it?
- What! with his fist on his hip? Have you seen Roger? So he's come to explain?
- I'm speaking figuratively, Médéric; thank God we didn't see him, because Alberte was so infatuated with this Châteaugrand that she could well have fallen back into her dark thoughts.
- So it's all over for him?
- Absolutely; and if you've come from Valroux hoping to put a stop to it, you'll have your work cut out for you, I warn you.
- Me!" said M. de Valroux nonchalantly, "I can only applaud your diplomatic skill. If this marriage does not make Alberte happy, it does credit to your skill and perseverance. Now, my dear, allow me to go and make myself presentable, I've just got out of a carriage full of dust. Have a small white box addressed to you taken from my luggage. It's full of flowers and even butterflies. It's a memento of your children. They spent all day yesterday making this double collection.
- I can't wait to see them!" sighed Madame de Valroux.
- I can tell from the difficulty I felt leaving them. You know that Maurice is becoming very wise and that my sister governs him very well.
- Your sister is at Valroux?
- Yes, since you left. She freed herself from her most pressing business to come and replace you for these eight days.
- I know that the children are very well with her. But I'm very anxious to get back to them. Will you stay in Paris after me, Médéric?
- I don't feel it's necessary.
- I'll be leaving the day after tomorrow. Alberte's engagement can take place at Valroux.
- I don't see any problem with that.
"So we're leaving the day after tomorrow.
- Frankly, it wasn't worth the trouble.
- In other words, I should have bothered before. Anyway, I'm going to be so kind for the next two days that my aunt will forgive me.
- I really think you want to make yourself necessary, Médéric," said Madame de Valroux with an ironic smile. However, I repeat, we have done very well without you.
- I realised that," grumbled Monsieur de Valroux.
And, picking up the small suitcase which he had placed on the carpet during this dialogue, he left for his flat with the most bored expression in the world.
XVIII -- The last skirmish
The reception room of the Canonsess de Bonlieu was very comfortable, especially when trained hands were in charge of lighting it, not with those modern lights with their brutal and blinding brightness, but with those beautiful lamps whose caressing and discreet light embellished things and people as if with pleasure.
The canoness smiled with contentment as she entered the flat, which had once been one of the beautiful salons of the vast hotel, and which had been decorated with particular elegance.
Madame de Bonlieu looked to see if the light was well arranged and if the flowers were pleasantly placed. That evening, she wanted her salon to shine. Under its high panelling, a destiny was about to take shape. This simple family gathering is extremely important and can be fraught with storms.
Madame de Valroux had manoeuvred so well that the canoness knew that Alberte was determined to break down the Duc de la Rochefaucon's last resistance, and as a good relative, slightly dazzled by the suitor's fortune, she had promised to support him and had fought valiantly on occasion against her cousin Enguerrand, who was still debating the ifs and buts.
Moreover, she was enormously flattered that Madame de Valroux had chosen her salon for this latest skirmish. So she put a certain coquettishness into embellishing and adorning it.
She acknowledges, not without pleasure, that her orders have been faithfully carried out and that everything has been put to good use.
This beautiful portrait of an ancestor is admirably lit!
This planter full of flowers looks great in this corner!
These seats are elegantly arranged for conversation, and are placed according to the rules of the most scrupulous hierarchy.
Opposite the canoness' large Louis XIII armchair is a beautiful Louis XV armchair, intended for the Duc de la Rochefaucon; next to it, this satin footstool will be the defendant's chair; then, in the middle, a pretty fancy armchair awaits the Marquise de Valroux, who will be very close to the Louis XIII armchair and will be able to receive its inspirations.
Having completed her review, the canoness took her seat and, looking up at the clock from time to time, plunged into deep reflection.
Although she had passed with arms and baggage into the camp of Madame de Valroux, it was not without a secret bitterness that she saw the conclusion of the marriage of one of her relatives to a stranger. A little inquisitive by nature, she had enquired about David Louzéma; she had pushed her research over the wall of private life, beyond which so many men are sheltered from self-interested investigations, and what she had discovered had slightly dampened her zeal; But Luna's death had occurred, Madame de Valroux had thrown the million annuity into the balance, she had made it such an irresistible argument that the canoness had closed her eyes and pronounced the sentence of absolution by the grace of this commonplace: 
- He's just like the others.
However, that very evening, while waiting for her nieces, she remembered certain unpleasant confidences that made her curse her own curiosity.
- My niece Madeleine showed more wisdom on this occasion than I did," she murmured suddenly, "she took him as he was; and, what's more, she says that Alberte converted him. The die is cast, and it is not at this decisive moment that we should amuse ourselves with retrospective trifles.
At this very moment, as if to put an end to these unpleasant memories, the valet announced:
- Monsieur le Duc de la Rochefaucon!
The canoness rose smiling to receive her cousin and gestured to the armchair opposite her.
- You will forgive me for being a few minutes early, my cousin," said the duke.
- Why, Enguerrand! but I expected you to arrive first. It is well known that there is not a more inaccurate woman in the world than the Marquise de Valroux.
- This evening I won't complain, because I think it would be useful to look a little deeper into the question of the marriage of a daughter of our house to this foreigner.
- Let's get to the bottom of it, Enguerrand, I couldn't ask for more.
The Duc de la Rochefaucon sat down and, fixing a serious, almost stern gaze on his interlocutor, said:
- Caroline, in interfering so actively in this affair, have you properly calculated the consequences?
- But, Enguerrand, I haven't interfered," she answered quickly, with a hint of embarrassment. Believe me, I don't intend to assume any responsibility. That is entirely up to the Marquise de Valroux, who, I hasten to add, certainly has only her sister's welfare in mind. Alberte herself is of a character determined enough not to let herself be married against her will.
- A young girl is so easily swayed, even in such a serious matter! No one is unaware that this marriage project has been hatched in the mind of Madame de Valroux.
- What does it matter? I don't believe in the influence of that thoughtless Madeleine on her sister.
- However, it is a fact that Alberte was more or less honour-bound to Roger de Châteaugrand, when this stranger appeared on the Parisian horizon and the Marquise de Valroux became infatuated with him.
- The Marquise de Valroux belongs to her century, Enguerrand; she is an elegant woman who needs so much money that she is always very embarrassed. That explains why she has a veritable cult of fortune.
- I know that; but I also know that her sister has nobler feelings.
- They are not at all alike, that's for sure. And if it hadn't been for the death of this young girl, which came at the right moment to inspire Alberte with tender compassion for her brother, Madame de Valroux would not have achieved her ends.
- So she did, Caroline?
- Yes, she did. Alberte, angry with the Châteaugrands, seemed determined to marry the foreign prince. That's the only reason why she arranged to meet him this evening.
- Prince? Come on! He's not even known by the English aristocracy, who live in India.
- Ah, really. I had a sneaking suspicion that Madeleine gave him that title at her pleasure. Anyway, he's part of some diplomatic corps. All his cards say 'Minister Plenipotentiary', which is fine.
- This is a new joke. He represents something like a district, which is completely unknown.
- And his decorations?
- We suspect he bought them.
- Finally, is his fortune, his colossal fortune, also in the fog? cried the canoness, who felt herself weakening.
- No, when it comes to money everything is true, minus a slight exaggeration. And it comes from an honourable source.
"But apart from the external conditions, there is the man.
"Does Madame de Valroux know everything about this young man's past?
- Madeleine knows nothing in depth and, moreover, she is indulgent in a way that could be described as dangerous. As she has a pearl of a husband, whose youth has not been shipwrecked, she takes pains to be unboundedly generous to young people in general.
"But, let's see, doesn't this young stranger now enjoy a good reputation? Madeleine considers him a kind of little saint and I know for a fact that he has been converted.
The duke nodded.
- There's a lot to be said for his past conduct," he replied.
- The past is the past, Enguerrand. I repeat, Alberte has undertaken her conversion. She was said to be well advanced. If that weren't so, this little man would be a monster of hypocrisy!
- No, he loves Alberte...
"And he no longer cultivates the demi-monde as assiduously. But there is the past!
- If he's a man of the underworld, I loathe him," cried the canoness, tormented more and more by her own reflections, "and I'm doing an about-turn. I swear to you, Enguerrand, I am firmly on the side of the opponents.
- He's an idler without a country, he's bored; in short, he's a man without principles.
- And his angel sister knew nothing about this?
- Not a thing. How do you expect these poor young girls to suspect these double lives? And how do you expect me to tell my niece these things? She wouldn't understand me.
- Finally, is Enguerrand worse than the others?
- Yes and no. It's just that he's said to have an infernal temper.
- It's certain that his black eyes sometimes have a diabolical expression.
"But do you know that things are well advanced. Alberte will not back down, even if I give her the spectacle of a defection.
"May I confess to you, Enguerrand, that I too would regret the million.
- You can take my advice, which is to wait for further information.
- I'll keep quiet, that's all I can promise. But I hear a carriage, it's those ladies.
"In truth, Enguerrand, you have cast such a pall over my enthusiasm that I now do not know how to welcome Madeleine, who expects to find in me the most determined of allies.
- Alberte is the only one involved, Caroline, let's just worry about Alberte.
- It's a yes that Alberte brings to us, I warn you in advance. It's no longer possible to hide it from you.
- At least I'll hear it from her," replied the duke, rising to receive Madame de Valroux and her sister, whom the servant had announced.
They were both dressed in elegant theatrical costumes and were followed by Monsieur de Valroux, who looked the most bored of all.
His unexpected presence was the first topic of conversation; the canoness joked with him about this fairy-tale appearance, the Duc de la Rochefaucon congratulated him on attending what he called an intimate family council; and after these banal words had been exchanged, the Marquise de Valroux, who appeared triumphant, attacked the question resolutely, saying to her uncle:
- My dear uncle, you know that I am piloting my ladies de Valroux du Rouergue around Paris and that I no longer have a minute's freedom. That's why I asked you for a moment's silence to get Alberte's marriage over with.
The Duke bowed.
- That is also my wish, my niece," he replied.
And turning to Alberte, he added:
- Alberte, have you made your final choice?
- Yes, uncle.
- And you have chosen...
- Monsieur David Louzéma," cried Madame de Valroux.
Alberte, very pale but very resolute, bowed her head in assent.
- Please say yes to this consent, my niece," continued the duke, "there must be no more misunderstandings. Do you freely consent to marry Monsieur David Louzéma?
- Yes," she said.
At this categorical reply, Monsieur de Valroux stumbled back in his chair, and looking fixedly at Alberte as if to detect in her face some contradiction, however slight, with his words, he exclaimed:
- You know, Alberte, that no one is forcing you to accept this stranger, and that I am categorically opposed to this choice.
- As am I," added the Duke.
- Uncle, as you said, we have to get this over with," said Alberte in a jerky voice that betrayed great agitation.
- What if I declare that the information I have gathered about him is not all to his advantage, niece?
- But we know him," cried Madame de Valroux. He was irreligious, that was very simple, but now he's converted. Do you want me to tell you everything? He did a thousand things as a young man; it was still very simple, having so much money to spend. That's the common story. All the possible information, all the backbiting, all the slander wouldn't make me change my mind.
The Duc de la Rochefaucon handed an envelope to the Viscountess de Valroux.
- Here are a few details that you'd do well to think about," he said, "only you can give Alberte an understanding of them.
- That's fine, I'll take care of it," replied the Viscountess de Valroux, tucking the envelope into her handkerchief. You see, Uncle, bear in mind that I had nothing to do with Alberte's decision. She has fought enough against my sympathies for Mr David. But we know him now, we know that he is in Rome, plunged in the deepest despair, and that alone would be enough to wipe the past clean.
- Madeleine, your aplomb astounds me!" exclaimed Monsieur de Valroux.
- You, Médéric, have no say in the matter, you are an enemy, an avowed friend of Monsieur le Comte de Châteaugrand, who has wounded Alberte to the core by refusing to resign. She was only putting this little condition on her consent, and he refused her. It was an impertinence she could not forgive him for.
She had said this very loudly, and as the word impertinence came out of her mouth, the valet's voice rang out, announcing:
- Madame la comtesse de Châteaugrand and her son!
XIX -- The defence
The gentle, melancholy face of the Countess de Châteaugrand stood out against the red door, and behind her rose Roger's blond head.
She crossed the salon with her slow, light step, and approached the forbidden canoness without the slightest embarrassment.
- Please forgive me, madame," she said, "but as I could not find the Marquise de Valroux at home, and as I absolutely had to speak to her, I took the liberty of presenting myself to you, where the very matter which has brought me to Paris is being discussed.
The canoness, who was both very embarrassed and very curious to see what was going to happen, replied with a few banal words of politeness and seated the unexpected visitors, whose presence had made the Marquise de Valroux's forehead turn red and brought a strange smile to her husband's lips.
It was Madame de Châteaugrand who broke the icy silence that greeted her arrival.
She turned to Alberte, who was pale with emotion.
- Alberte," she said, "are we too late? Does my son still have the right to explain his refusal to you?
Madame de Valroux replied:
- Alberte is no longer free, madame, she has just declared her intentions to our uncle, the Duc de la Rochefaucon.
Alberte looked at her sister, then at her aunt, whose gentle, penetrating gaze never left her.
- I'm perfectly free to hear what you have to say, Aunt," she replied in an uncertain voice.
Madame de Châteaugrand turned to her son:
- Come on, Roger, defend yourself," she said. Alberte must be fully informed and know why you preferred your career to hers. Once that's explained, we'll be the first to let things go.
The young officer stood up. One hand resting on his sword, his loyal gaze lowered on Alberte, he said in a vibrant voice:
- Forgive a soldier for coming to defend himself in person. But as my mother said, Alberte, before I let the sweetest hope of my life be shattered, before I renounce you forever, I want you to know clearly the reasons for my refusal.
"How is it, in fact, that on a simple word from you, I did not strip off this uniform and send my resignation to the Minister of War?
"Your letters had more than once insinuated this desire to my mother, which a little later became an absolute condition.
"As you may have guessed, there was a hard struggle between my love and what I considered to be my duty.
"I surrendered cowardly and, during a visit to the general, I made him sense that I was going to regain my freedom.
"He did not answer me at first, but I saw that he was very impressed.
"That same evening he wrote me the following note.
The young man took the note handed to him by his mother and read:
"My dear Lieutenant,
"No, you will not resign, no, you will not leave the army; that would be desertion, it would be, forgive my old frankness, it would be cowardice.
"You are one of our officers of the future: the army, France, you understand, France, needs you.
"In the regiment, your resignation would be regarded, between us, as a defection, as a public misfortune.
"I now leave it to your honour to decide.
- I know the man who wrote this," said Roger, "he doesn't know how to flatter.
Alberte," I said to my mother, "may have acted without thinking, I will tell her my reasons, and, I know her, she will not let me break my sword.
"And while loving you from the depths of my heart, I went back to studying the profession of arms that I had chosen in a fit of patriotism.
"Yes, that very day, Alberte, electrified by the thought that France needed my services, I made a pact with my country, I pledged my intelligence to her, I promised that, even if it cost me my happiness, I would serve her with all my strength.
"Could I have thought that a woman bearing the name of La Rochefaucon, a woman whose nobility of soul I knew, would soon demand the supreme sacrifice of me and refuse to understand the grave reasons for my determination?
"Alberte, when you presented my mother with this cruel alternative, you tore my heart apart. No, alas, it was my patriotism that forced me to make these hard sacrifices. And now, must this devotion, the noblest and most selfless that a man can impose on himself, must it lead to the misfortune of my entire life?
"Can I not be a Frenchman, bearing the sword of a humiliated and defeated France, and give you my name?
"Ah, what a terrible storm you have unleashed within me!
"I was troubled, I doubted my destiny. For a moment, I cursed this country whose love my mother and my masters had given me; there was a moment when I tried to feel contempt for this army that had been defeated; there was a moment when I drew my sword to break it.
"If I had done so, would you esteem me? If I weakened, if I broke my oaths, if I brazenly threw at your feet this cowardly heart that could not overcome itself, would you accept it?
"Or am I mistaken?
"Does the descendant of the old La Rochefaucon race no longer understand the passion for the fatherland pushed to the point of heroism?
He inclined his head and continued in a painful accent:
- Then let all be finished between us, marry this foreigner who has not a drop of French blood in his veins, nor a French sentiment in his heart.
He was silent. The canoness, electrified by these words, brought her handkerchief to her tear-filled eyes, while the Duc de la Rochefaucon raised his noble head to gaze at Roger with pride.
Alberte had dropped her pale face into her hands.
Madame de Valroux's impertinence distracted from the general emotion.
- Is that all, sir?" she asked, reattaching the nickel-plated clasp on her theatre ticket.
- That's all, madame, I've said it all, let Mademoiselle de la Rochefaucon decide.
- Alberte, what have you decided? That we're going to the theatre, right? My cousins from Valroux must be feverish not to see us arrive... And she stood up.
Alberte stopped her with a gesture.
Violent irresolution painted itself on her beautiful face.
- Roger," she said, lowering her eyes to avoid meeting the sparkling gaze that penetrated to the very last fibres of her heart, "I thank you for coming.
"Tomorrow I shall write my definitive reply to my uncle de la Rochefaucon; but whatever happens, yes, whatever happens, I admire you.
And with these words spoken without her daring to look up, she followed her sister, who had hastily described her curtseys and had already reached the salon door.
On the staircase, Madame de Valroux asked Alberte if she had her bottle of salts, and when she replied in the negative, she said:
- Remind me to take it, because, in truth, Mr de Châteaugrand has upset me with his tragic airs. Could we ever have imagined this ridiculous scene in the home of Madame de Bonlieu, whom he hardly knows? He comes to say what everyone knows, while poor David is far away, plunged in real despair!
"Don't go telling her about this outing, at least!
And liven up that dejected countenance that would frighten our provincials.
- Madeleine, you're tiring me out," Alberte replied despondently. Don't impose these conventional airs on me. It's awful to break the hearts of people I've loved so much.
- Well, maybe David isn't heartbroken!
Alberte sighed deeply:
- If I didn't believe him," she said, "I would have followed my impulse just now and in a month I would have been the wife of this man who has a God, a country and a heart.
Madame de Valroux, who was getting back into the carriage, did not hear this reply very clearly, which relieved Alberte of further teasing.
The coachman, spurred on by his mistress's orders, drove her back to the Rue de Lille in a few minutes.
- Madame, there's a carriage in the courtyard," said the footman as the coupé prepared to cross the threshold of the hotel.
- Ah, my God, my provincials are losing their patience," cried Madame de Valroux. And turning to her sister, she added:
- Alberte, will you go and see what's going on and send my aunt, to whom I must do the honours of my carriage?
Alberte, tired of the tête-à-tête with her sister, seized the opportunity to free herself from her sister and hastened to obey her.
She went to the two-horse carriage parked in front of the stoop and found it filled with the Valroux ladies, who were discussing whether they would leave for the Opera without waiting for their relative.
Exclamations of joy greeted Alberte, and the mother of the family, a tall, strong woman accustomed to taking her ease, did not hesitate to dislodge herself from the carriage in which she was suffocating. Led by the footman, she went to join the Marquise de Valroux. Alberte took her place, which allowed the demoiselles de Valroux to sit down, and the two carriages drove, one following the other, towards the Opéra.
When the Marquise de Valroux set foot on the first step of the marvellous staircase that everyone knows and admires, her face bore no trace of the unpleasant emotions she had felt not an hour before.
She was delighted to hear the admiring expressions of her provincial relations, and, while saying loudly that it was very old-fashioned to go to the Opéra to hear La Muette, she hastened to introduce them into the box they had rented somewhat at random. It was one of those boxes sacrificed to the harmony of the whole and in which there is room at the front for only two people.
The tall Valroux girls were seated there, at the request of Alberte who, by mutual agreement, found herself relegated to the third row with an old cousin who was always content with the last seat. It was enough for her to see the youth of her relatives shining before her for her to declare herself satisfied.
This arrangement, discussed at length, suited Alberte perfectly, whose face still betrayed deep emotion. She herself had never even thought of leaving the salon where Roger de Châteaugrand had appeared so beautiful in his magnificent bursts of patriotism. His words, his gaze and her mother's gaze had shaken her to the core. It wasn't the first time she had felt the pangs of remorse, and she sometimes repeated Luna's name to herself to explain the cause of her infidelities.
Sheltered by the living screen formed in front of her by the Valroux ladies, she cared very little for what was happening on stage; music itself, music, that enchantress who accommodates suffering as well as joy, left her unmoved.
But her neighbour was the vivacious little Miss de Valroux, who, while generously sacrificing the first places to the young people, did not intend to lose a single detail of the show.
So she made every effort to spare herself a view of the stage.
- My dear Louise," she said, "move your elbow a little further away, and you, Valentine, sit three quarters of the way up. That's it, I can see well enough, just don't move without my permission.
Thanks to all these little arrangements, to which the older cousins complacently lent themselves, she was able to attend the show, despite her small size and remote position. And, too expansive to keep her impressions, which were very vivid, to herself, she naturally expressed them to her neighbour, who, standing at the back of the dressing room, would have seen everything, but who voluntarily stood in a sort of physical and moral despondency, while listening mechanically to the remarks of the provincial, as Madame de Valroux used to say, remarks which lacked neither aptness nor wit.
- Mademoiselle Alberte, listen to this air," she suddenly exclaimed. Isn't it ravishing?
"God! it was sung in my youth! I can't say sung. Today, it's the same tune and the same song, but what a difference! I'm told that it's not the leads who are performing.
"So what would the others be like!
"And this set! Is it fresh enough? Is it pretty enough? Is it real enough?
"Tell me, do you understand anything of what this queen sings?
"And the king, what does he want?
"Ah, here is Masaniello at last. My heart beats as I listen to that well-known, charming tune:
Friends, the morning is beautiful...
"The hall is quite full now. What a bathroom!
"This woman, all alone in this dressing room, is very beautiful and looks very bored. I'm not the one who'll be bored tonight.
"She must be a great lady, do you know her?
"Over there, those beautiful empty boxes are those of the government, I'm told. Nothing Spartan about them.
"How can your government accept such royal luxury? You'd be forgiven for thinking that they know the proverb: 'Get out of my way so I can get in.
"That's a whole policy now. The princes, however, had to look a little better. And the princesses!
"At least in those days you got what you paid for, you were proud of your sovereigns. Now it's all just silly money. Frankly, for new layers of society to be so egalitarian is to act singularly.
"Who are these people? Look at those women standing there. What an outfit! What a dress! What kind of world are they from?
Willy-nilly, Alberte lent an inattentive ear to the verbiage of her cousin, who did not even stop to listen to the answers to her questions.
At his last exclamation, she rose to glance into the box indicated and remained standing, wondering if she was really awake.
Three shabbily dressed, painted women were sitting in this beautiful box, and David Louzéma himself was offering a bouquet to one of them.
Was it really him? It was his pale face, his aquiline nose, his black eyes, his frizzy hair; but it must have been someone else.
David was in Rome, a sad David, busy mourning Luna, waiting in anguish for Alberte to give up.
- Well, who are these women?" said his neighbour. You've looked at them enough as it is. Do you know them? Are they decent women, despite appearances?
- I don't know them," replied Alberte, dropping onto her stool. "They're nothing if not distinguished; I think they're people who don't exist in our world.
- What types! Do you know what I dislike most about Paris? It's to think that there's almost nowhere to escape from these women of the demi-monde.
"These women seem to belong to that category, and it makes me shudder with anger to see these shameless, dishonoured women passing side by side with my nieces!
The little lady spoke so animatedly that Louise de Valroux snapped out of her ecstatic state and turned away to say to her:
- What are you saying, Auntie?
- Nothing, nothing at all. It's just that I think you look too much in the dressing rooms, Louise.
"Do we know the people there? We're not at home here. Worry about the show and less about the audience.
And turning to Alberte, she added:
- You're a Parisian; you're not silly and naive like those tall girls for whom everything that glitters is pure gold.
"But let's get back to the show, shall we?
"Where are we?
"Ah! the mute is on stage; I don't like this pantomime very much. It's a strange idea to put a mute character on an opera stage. What heat!
"Here come more people. I wonder where these officers are going to be. Can we get to the show at this hour?
"They are dragoon officers. -- I have a nephew in the dragoons, the brother of Louise and Valentine.
At the words "They're officers in the dragoons", Alberte rose again, as mechanically as the first time.
Five young officers were standing at the foot of the stalls and remained there, no doubt unwilling to return to their places in the middle of a scene. One of them stood alone, out of the way, and could be seen perfectly well from Alberte's box, thanks to his tall stature.
It was Roger de Châteaugrand, Roger whose blond head was bowed by an obviously painful thought, Roger pale and sad in this golden room, Roger who had not a glance for all those dazzling women his comrades were ogling.
By a curious twist of fate, Alberte could see her two suitors without being seen, simply by rising from her velvet stool.
David -- she could not doubt that it was he -- was eager to see the women he accompanied, she could hear his shrill laughter, she could catch his glances from which melancholy and regret were completely absent.
It had barely been a month since Luna had been carried off in her coffin and he was laughing in the middle of the Opera House, with strangers whom Alberte tried to take for women from the foreign colony, even though she had never met them and the sight of them hurt her.
And Roger was there too, with his poignant sorrow, which showed on his features, with his virile resolve, with his big heart.
Alberte never tired of looking at him.
Suddenly, she saw him raise his head as if by an electric shock, he turned very pale, his dark eyes sparkled and he turned suddenly towards the stage.
At that very moment, Alberte's neighbour touched his shoulder with her finger and whispered:
- Oh, Miss Alberte, this is what I can't hear without feeling. Come out of your cold disdain. Listen, listen!
Sacred love of country,
Give us back our boldness and our pride...
Alberte didn't need this prayer. She listened with all her soul, her eyes fixed on Roger de Châteaugrand.
The same expression that she had seen on his martial face in the salon of the Canonsess of Bonlieu was lighting him up at this moment.
When the two conspirators, hand in hand, repeated together, to the admirable tune of a rhythm that was unfortunately too fast:
Sacred love of country,
Give us back our boldness and pride...
she saw him turn his head away to hide two tears welling up in his eyes. Then she herself, hiding at the back of the dressing room, wiped away the tears that rose from her heart to her eyelids.
At that moment, her sister, who had her back to the dressing room occupied by David Louzéma and to the place where Roger was standing, turned away to stifle a yawn in her handkerchief, and mockingly questioned her about this sudden outburst of sensitivity:
-- But, Alberte, you seem to be hearing La Muette for the first time," she said. My cousins are intoxicated, that's understandable; but all those familiar tunes have little charm for us now.
"And first of all, let's see, you don't cry at the theatre, that's childish...
- Madame, you cry when you have tears in your eyes," said the little Miss de Valroux, who was bursting into tears, "and, for my part, precisely since my poor country has been so stripped of its former splendour in the eyes of Europe, I cannot hear it sung without being moved to the depths of my soul. Everyone feels as they can, and you can leave it to us, Mademoiselle Alberte and I, to be moved as we please, since at first no one can see us.
As she spoke these last words there was a knock at the dressing room door. It was Monsieur Robert Dragonneau who entered.
He had recognised Madame la Marquise de Valroux, whom he thought was in Valroux, and had come to pay his respects.
Madame de Valroux, delighted to escape a performance she found boring, chatted with the young man for a few moments and asked him for news from Paris.
While she was talking to him, Alberte was trying to find a way of letting him know that David Louzéma was nearby. She joined in the conversation for a moment and then suddenly said, rising to her feet:
- Madeleine, look behind you in the next box, I think I recognise Monsieur Louzéma.
Madame de Valroux stared in amazement and turned away. The women David was accompanying had had enough of these patriotic or religious airs, they noisily packed their bags, and it was hardly that she caught sight of their escort.
- Indeed, this young man bears a certain resemblance to Monsieur Louzéma," she said, "but you know very well it's not him.
- A thousand pardons, madame," said Monsieur Dragonneau, "I shook his hand when he entered the theatre.
- What do you mean, he's in Paris? How long ago?
- I met him a fortnight ago. The poor boy needed the distractions of Paris; he couldn't take it any more, it seems.
- Monsieur, I assure you that Monsieur Louzéma is in Rome," said Madame de Valroux solemnly.
- Madame, he went there to settle certain matters of interest concerning his sister; but he returned almost immediately to amuse himself, I have the honour of telling you.
- Are you sure of this, sir, quite sure?
- Madam, do you need proof? Mr Louzéma, believing you to be in Valroux as I do, asked me for details of the route to take to visit you. As you can see, he's not someone else.
- And who are these ladies he's accompanying?" asked Alberte carelessly, "I've never met them at Luna's house.
- No, mademoiselle, oh no.
- Well, I've seen them," affirmed Madame de Valroux. That fat brunette, who dyes her eyes, is the wife of a consul from...
And seeing Monsieur Dragonneau smiling and shaking his head, she exclaimed:
- Well, sir, tell us who they are, since you know so well.
And he, after glancing at Alberte, replied:
- Those names, madame, could not be uttered here without disrespecting you.
Madame de Valroux gave her a displeased look, and not knowing how to contain her agitation, she turned back to her neighbour.
- You're asleep, Aunt, I believe?
- I'm not used to staying up so late, and this heat and these lights are overwhelming me.
Madame de Valroux stood up.
-- You've had enough and so have I," she said. You've seen the auditorium, that's all you need, because, in truth, you don't come to the Opéra for the Muette.
The good lady glanced at her daughters, who were looking at her imploringly.
- Aren't you bored," she said, "don't you want to leave?
- No, Mother, we'd like to stay until the end.
- Leave them to me," said the little aunt, "it's not the first time I've chaperoned them.
- No doubt. So see you soon, my girls, enjoy yourselves and, when you come back, come and kiss me, because I won't be able to fall asleep until I know you're back.
Having said this, she left the dressing room with the Marquise de Valroux and Monsieur Dragonneau, who had offered her his arm.
- Now, squeeze your elbows together a little, my nieces," said the little aunt, "and let me have a good look in turn.
She slipped into the marquise's seat, and Alberte was able to give herself over in peace to all the reflections suggested to her by these two strange and providential encounters. She sank in so deeply that the room, the music and the time all escaped her at once.
She shuddered when she heard the good aunt apostrophise:
- Mademoiselle Alberte, are you sleeping for good? It's time to wake up. Come on, my nieces, it's all over this time: Vesuvius is erupting. It looks like real fire, real ash, real lava. It's simply marvellous, and I could say that I've seen a volcano at work... in paint. Let's get out of here, let's get out of here.
They went out, got out of the crowd as best they could and also out of the cloakroom, an absolutely sacrificed room in the palace of music, and got back into the two-horse carriage. During the journey, the conversation was extremely lively, and Alberte had to join in.
It was extremely costly for her, and she was greatly relieved when she arrived at the hotel. While the Misses de Valroux went to embrace their worried mother, she hurried back to her flat.
And there, even before leaving her evening gown, she got down on her knees, and joining her hands with humble and ardent fervour, she thanked God for having shown her in time the abyss into which her inexperience and the mad generosity of her heart had risked leading her.
Epilogue
- Madame la Comtesse's carriage pulled up.
The young woman to whom these words were addressed, who had been reading to make useful use of the leisure of waiting, walked towards a small salon and said:
- Mother, the carriage is waiting.
And Roger de Châteaugrand's mother appeared; she was dressed in black, as always, and wore on her arm a large wreath of immortals, the emblem of eternal regret, but her face was rested, almost happy.
- Is Roger coming with us, Alberte?
- No, my mother, he won't be free for half an hour; but he'll be riding to Père-Lachaise, and we'll certainly meet.
- Come on," said Madame de Châteaugrand.
And she added, looking tenderly at Alberte:
- Ah! how this painful pilgrimage is softened this year by your presence!
A smile answered her, and the beautiful young woman, taking a wreath of white carnations from a nearby console, followed her mother-in-law and climbed into the waiting coupé, which set off in the direction of the Champs-Élysées.
The sun, very mild for the time of year, was the sun of the Day of the Dead, and perhaps more than one of the people in the Countess de Châteaugrand's carriage was heading, as she was, for the field of eternal rest.
But in Paris, crowds form a thousand currents that are not easy to distinguish in this moving ocean.
As the Châteaugrand ladies' carriage crossed the Place du Carrousel, it came across a dashing carriage which stopped short. The bellboy jumped down to repair the accident and Alberte, placing her hand on her mother-in-law's shoulder, exclaimed:
- Mother, look at that young man driving, it's him!
- Who, Alberte?
- David Louzéma.
Madame de Châteaugrand quickly rolled down the window and leaned over to look. It was too late, the car had gone.
- I regret this unique opportunity to get to know my Roger's rival," she said. There were a lot of them in that car, I think.
- Yes, this very day, the Day of the Dead!
Madame de Châteaugrand smiled sadly.
- For affections to triumph over the dreaded oblivion of death, they must have been very true and very unselfish," she said. Ah, blessed be the faith that softens these mysterious and terrible separations! Nobody loves beyond the grave like we Catholics.
- I only understand eternal affections," murmured Alberte.
- So, my daughter, you have been providentially saved from this foreign marriage, which would have left you in an abyss of pain.
- I believe it, I believe it. There are times when, reflecting on the combination of circumstances that led me to Luna's brother, I shudder to think of myself.
- It was very close indeed. When I went to see Madame de Bonlieu, I had given up hope, but I wanted you to meet my son. A letter is inanimate. And no matter how much we told you that we loved you with all our hearts, the brutal fact of your refusal to resign spoke louder than our written protests.
- My God, Mother, I've been blind!" said the young woman with adorable humility. Would you believe it? I still can't explain to myself how Madeleine got me this far.
- You were the dupe of your own good heart, Alberte. Madeleine said so herself. It was through the truly tragic death of this young girl that she had achieved her ends. You know that she's becoming much kinder to me, there's a kind of turnaround in her favour.
- I even think she would willingly forgive Médéric. Isn't it time you explained to her the mystery of your arrival at my aunt de Bonlieu's?
Madame de Châteaugrand nodded:
- No," she said, "Madeleine is certainly feeling better, and we're taking advantage of that; but let's not dredge up the past again. Mr de Valroux has asked us for absolute discretion. It is up to him to speak when he wishes. And as he knows his wife, he will only speak when he is sure of not arousing any resentment.
- Good old Médéric! I will be eternally grateful to him. Without him, I was lost.
- Yes, my daughter. Ah, he was very clever and very patient. His wife never suspected that he was keeping us informed of everything that was going on, never had the thought that it was in our interest that he was leaving Valroux, never guessed that the dispatch that called us to Madame de Bonlieu's that evening was from him.
- I had a slight suspicion when I saw you appear. At that very moment, I felt a sensation of deliverance.
Madame de Châteaugrand looked tenderly at the young woman.
- You were meant to belong to us, it was written in your destiny," she said, "and when God wants something, it happens.
Alberte shook her hand in reply, and they remained silent, giving free rein to their thoughts, which were gentle but soon took a melancholy turn.
As the car made its way towards the cemetery, it was easy to see a sort of current moving through the crowd in the same direction. All these passers-by, whether singly or in groups, were easily distinguishable from the others. Wreaths, bouquets and statuettes revealed the purpose of their walk. And the crowd was growing; for if there are many people in Paris who do not know how to seek out the eternal joys of All Saints' Day, nor join in the happiness of the chosen ones of the triumphant Church, if there are too many, alas! who do not reread the Gospel which reveals the mysterious beatitude that makes the happy, the humble, the poor, the peaceful, the hungry for justice, the suffering, the merciful and the chaste, there are some who will never sacrifice their devotion to that other Church, invisible too, but suffering, whose heart alone would prove its existence. These are the ones who take to their parents a memory which, for believers, is accompanied by a fervent prayer.
In the sad streets around the magnificent cemetery, in the vicinity of the terrible prison of La Roquette now so often visited by the perpetrators of abominable modern crimes, traffic was becoming increasingly difficult.
It was materially impossible for the coachman of the Châteaugrand ladies to drive them to the gate, and the ladies hastened to declare that they would walk to the cemetery.
They were getting out of the carriage when the gallop of a horse was heard in the street. It was Roger de Châteaugrand arriving, followed by his orderly. He dismounted and shook hands with his wife and her mother. Then he went ahead of them to clear a path through the compact and uncongenial crowd.
Madame de Châteaugrand, crossing the threshold of the sacred enclosure, had taken the arm offered to her by her son. She walked, praying mentally, between him and Alberte, whose graceful face had darkened.
Madame de Châteaugrand guided her children with sure steps through the labyrinth of crowded aisles. It was clear that it was not only on the Day of the Dead that she came to pray at the tomb of her son, taken from her at the tender age of twenty.
All those paths had become familiar to her; she had shed so many tears there!
Not far from the tomb of this statesman whose selfish ambition was so fatal to France, almost side by side with the temporary tomb of M. Thiers, stood a monument of severe style bearing the Châteaugrand crest.
The small iron door had been opened; candles were burning on the simple altar, and the three visitors were able to kneel down immediately above the vault that contained so many cherished remains.
Madame de Châteaugrand, representing the past, was praying on her prie-Dieu, placed in a corner. Roger and Alberte, charming beings, personifying the present and the future, were kneeling side by side on the altar step, praying with one heart.
After a quarter of an hour of contemplation, Madame de Châteaugrand rose and replaced the faded wreath on the small altar with the fresh wreath she had brought with her:
- Go now to your friend, dear child," she said, "I will wait for you here.
Roger and Alberte signed, left the vault and went the opposite way.
Roger had taken the large wreath of white carnations from his wife's hands and was helping her search through the multitude of graves.
She suddenly stopped.
- I can't see anything, absolutely nothing like Luna's monument," she said. The monument to General Gobert, which rises to the left, struck me on the fatal day of the funeral.
"Roger, go and see what name is inscribed on that white marble column over there. Luna's tomb was supposed to be made of white marble, with a statue of youth mourning her. But perhaps the style has been changed.
Mr de Châteaugrand went to examine the monument and came back saying that French names were inscribed on it.
- It's astonishing, it's astonishing," murmured Alberte. Did he have his remains taken somewhere? I don't understand it. Let's walk along this path for a while, Roger. The temporary tomb was towards the middle. I saw it, I saw it perfectly. It was just a big marble rhombus with his first name and the date of his death engraved on it.
- A marble lozenge?" repeated Roger, "here's one that's touching us, here under this wild grass.
- I told you it was white marble, Roger, and besides, it's impossible that his brother didn't think of replacing this poor waiting stone with the monument whose design he had shown me.
In reply, Roger used his riding crop to clear away the weeds covering the marble he had pointed out to his wife and, bending over the greenish, mossy stone, he read out loud:
LUNA
Paris, 20th April 1880.
Alberte raised her tear-filled eyes to heaven.
- Oh, this forgetfulness!" she murmured, "this cruel forgetfulness!
Roger continued to clear away the stone and soon it emerged from the grass.
Alberte piously placed the wreath she had been wearing on the abandoned grave, and Luna's name was surrounded by white carnations.
Then she knelt down, and in her prayer for poor Luna's soul were mingled expressions of gratitude to God, who in his goodness had snatched her from a heartless being.
When she had finished praying, she stood up and leaned on her husband's arm:
- We'll look after this little grave, won't we, Roger?" she said, "we'll save it from total oblivion.
And raising her eyes to the loyal face of the man to whom she had so happily chained her destiny, she added in a low, deep voice:
- My friend, how can those who do not know how to mourn so boldly affirm that they will always love?
- They lie, Alberte," replied Roger, "they don't love.
- I have proof of that today," murmured Alberte. She loved him so much!
Roger gave her a look of tender reproach.
- Alberte, you know, don't ever talk to me about that again," he said, leading her off the path.
And she replied with her radiant smile:
- But you can't blame me for taking every opportunity to express my gratitude.
And so, talking very quietly, out of respect for the place where they were, they made their way back to the Châteaugrand funeral monument.
Madame de Châteaugrand was waiting for them.
They rode in silence back to the entrance, and also back to the mode of transport they had adopted.
Roger got back on his horse after having his mother and his wife get into the carriage, and left, saying to them:
- See you soon.
Naturally, he was the first to arrive in the Rue de Lille, at the Hôtel de la Rochefaucon, which belonged to the two sisters and whose second floor was occupied by Alberte.
He lit a cigar and waited in the courtyard for the coupé.
And when the ladies got out, he said cheerfully:
- Now, back to the happy news, shall we? This morning I received the official announcement of my new rank.
- Let's go and tell Médéric," said Alberte cheerfully, "nothing would give him greater pleasure.
- Come on," said Madame de Châteaugrand, smiling.
Roger offered his arm to his wife and they climbed the stairs to the first floor. There they separated from Madame de Châteaugrand, entered the wide corridor and knocked on the door of Madame de Valroux's small salon.
- Come in," replied Monsieur de Valroux's voice.
They entered, and Roger, bowing deeply to Madame de Valroux and Madame de Bonlieu, seated side by side, turned to Monsieur de Valroux and said:
- Médéric, greet me as the youngest cavalry captain in the French army.
- Are you a captain, Roger?" exclaimed Monsieur de Valroux.
- For three hours.
- My God, Alberte, you're happy," exclaimed Madame de Valroux, who was looking very upset, "your husband is making progress, you're getting on with your mother-in-law, you have excellent servants. But I'm always worried. Would you believe...
She posed indignantly.
- Would you believe that this Baroness de Lextreville told my aunt that I had entrusted her with all the affairs of your marriage, would you believe that she posed as a confidante and had the audacity to invite me to a tea she was giving in three days' time?
- I think I've seen you very close to her, Madeleine," replied Alberte with a smile that was not without malice.
- Not as she says, not as she says. I'm not at all aware that she takes this familiar form. I've heard so much about her that I'm determined to leave her there.
"It's not for nothing that I met Ernest de Lextreville this summer. He doesn't see this woman at all, who has led his father astray. I even learned from her reticence that she knew the stage by more than name.
"Is that horrible enough!
- They used to say that, Madeleine.
- It was said much worse," exclaimed the canoness in her turn, "I never understood your affair with her.
- I thought it was a slander, Aunt.
- Slander, my dear, does not last so long without being pointed out by those concerned. All you had to do was look at that young woman. Honour, especially feminine honour, can be seen on the faces of truly honest women. I told you, she never inspired the slightest confidence in me and I put her right back in her place when she came to complain to me about your change of manners towards her, and to tell me a thousand things about this young couple who, in spite of herself, are the happiest in the world.
"To hear her tell it, you arranged Alberte's marriage to that little yellow Indian who wore such a beautiful rajah's costume at your cross-dressing ball.
- Never with her," cried Madame de Valroux, "with you, yes, but not with her. I was wrong to talk to her about it, it's true, but not in the way she says.
- Come on, Madeleine, be a good player and know how to lose," said Monsieur de Valroux cheerfully. You have been forgiven a lot, even though you have intrigued a lot.
"For my part, I thank you for breaking with this woman of shady reputation. So admit to us in all simplicity that you were mistaken.
"Alberte and Roger are, my faith, happy enough to forget everything.
Madame de Valroux dropped her face into her hands.
-- Come, Madeleine, do your little mea culpa, and let there be no more talk of that," said Alberte affectionately. You wanted, for my own good, to make me marry a fortune, and I, by a providential idea, preferred to a foreigner the man in whom, as I once said, I found a God, a country and a heart. All's well that ends well.
- Oh yes, I was very imprudent," said Madame de Valroux at last, with the first feeling of contrition her husband had ever known.
- And so was I," added the canoness; "but I curse my blindness every day, because at last this blessed marriage, this happy marriage which reconciles me with all the Châteaugrands, has, thanks to our cowardice, hung by a thread.
- Telegraphic," murmured Monsieur de Valroux, laughing.
