I
My present position does not mean that Fortune is my godmother. My ancestors, if the word is not too ambitious, were fishermen; my father was the youngest of eleven children, and my grandfather had had great difficulty bringing up his family, for in this profession more than in any other, the gain is not in proportion to the work; to count on fatigue and danger is certainty; on a little money, chance.
At the age of eighteen, my father was taken by the maritime registration; it's a kind of conscription, by means of which the State can have all sailors serve for thirty-two years... from eighteen to fifty. He set off not knowing how to read or write. He came back a chief petty officer, which is the highest rank attained by those who have not been through government schools.
Port-Dieu, our country, being close to the English islands, the State stationed a war cutter there, whose mission was to prevent the people of Jersey from coming to take our fish, at the same time as forcing our sailors to observe the fishing regulations: it was on this cutter that my father was sent to continue his service. It was a favour, because however much one is used to making one's ship one's homeland, one is always happy to return to the land of one's birth.
Fifteen months after this return, I made my entry into the world, and as it was in March, on a Friday, a new moon day, everyone agreed in predicting that I would have adventures, that I would make sea voyages, and that I would be very unhappy, if the influence of the moon did not counteract that of Friday: -- As for the battle between the two influences, it was fierce; it is you who will say at the end of my account which of the two prevailed. 
To predict adventures and voyages for me was to recognise that I was indeed a child of the family, for from father to son all the Kalbris had been sailors, and even, if the legend is true, they were so at the time of the Trojan War. It is not we, of course, who give ourselves this origin, but scholars who claim that there are a hundred or so families in Port-Dieu, precisely that of the sailors, who are descended from a colony of Phoenicians. What is certain is that, with our black eyes, bearded complexion and fine nose, we have nothing of the Norman or Breton type, and that our fishing boats are an exact reproduction of Ulysses' boat as depicted by Homer: a single mast with a square sail; this rigging, very common in the Archipelago, is unique in the Channel.
For us, our memories went back less far, and even their uniformity made them rather confused; when we spoke of a relative, the story was hardly varied: When we spoke of a relative, the story was not very varied: as a child he had been at sea or beyond the seas, among peoples whose names are difficult to remember, and he had died in a shipwreck, in battles, on the English pontoons; the crosses bearing the name of a girl or a widow were numerous in the cemetery, those bearing the name of a boy or a man were few; those didn't die at home. As in all families, however, we had our heroes: one was my maternal grandfather, who had been Surcouf's companion; the other was my great-uncle Flohy. As soon as I understood what was being said around me, I heard his name ten times a day; he was in the service of a king of India who had elephants; he commanded troops against the English, and he had a silver arm; elephants and a silver arm were no dream.
It was the need for adventure innate in all Kalbris that made my father embark again a few years after his marriage; he could have commanded, as first mate, one of the schooners that leave every year in the spring to fish in Iceland; but he was made to serve the State and he loved it.
I don't remember him leaving. My only memories of that time are of stormy days, stormy nights and the hours I spent in front of the post office.
How many times at night my mother made me pray in front of a candle that she lit! For us, the storm at Port-Dieu was a storm everywhere, and the wind that shook our house seemed to shake my father's ship at the same time. Sometimes it blew so hard that we had to get up to fasten the windows, because our house was a poor people's house; although it was sheltered on one side by a landslide in the cliff, and on the other by a deckhouse that had once been the saloon of a wrecked three-masted ship, it did not stand up well to the gusts of the equinox. One night in October, my mother woke me up: the hurricane was terrible, the wind was howling, the house was groaning, and there were gusts that made the candle flame flicker until it was extinguished; in the moments of calm, you could hear the battle of the waves against the pebbles, and, like detonations, the pounding of the sea in the holes in the cliff. In spite of this tremendous noise, I soon fell back asleep on my knees: all of a sudden the window was torn from its fittings, thrown into the room where it shattered into a thousand pieces, and I seemed to be swept away in a whirlwind.
My God," cried my mother, "your father is lost!
She had faith in presentiments and marvellous warnings; a letter she received from my father a few months after that stormy night made this faith even stronger; by a strange coincidence, he had been attacked by a gale in October and was in great danger. The sleep of a sailor's wife is a sad sleep: dreaming of shipwreck, waiting for a letter that doesn't arrive, her life is spent between these two anxieties.
In those days, letters were not delivered as they are today; they were simply handed out at the office, and when those to whom they were addressed were too late in coming to collect them, they were sent to them by a boy from the school. The day the mail arrived from Newfoundland, the office was besieged, because from spring to autumn, all the sailors embarked for the cod fishery, and a stranger arriving in the country might think he was on the island mentioned by Ariosto and from which men were excluded; so the women were in a hurry to get news. With their children in their arms, they waited for the names to be called. Some laughed as they read, others wept. Those who had no letters asked those who had received some; it's not when the sailors are at sea that you can say: "No news, good news".
There was an old woman who had been coming every day for six years, and who hadn't received a letter for six years: she was called the mother Jouan, and it was said that a canoe put together by her husband and her four boys had disappeared in a squall, and neither the canoe nor the men had been found. Since the news had spread, she had come to the post office every morning. There's nothing for you yet," said the tobacconist, "it'll have to be tomorrow. She would reply sadly: "Yes, tomorrow. And she would go away and come back the next day. It was said that she was out of her mind; crazy as she was, I have never since seen such a sad and gentle madness as hers.
Almost every time I went to the office, I found her already there. As the tobacconist was both grocer and postmaster, he naturally began by dealing with those who asked him for salt or coffee, and thus gave us plenty of time to chat; methodical and rigorous about the customs of his dual profession, he made this time even longer by all sorts of preparatory ceremonies: as a grocer, he wore a blue apron and a cap; as a postmaster, a sheet jacket and a velvet hat. For nothing in the world would he have served mustard with a cap on his head, and knowing that he had in his hands a letter on which the lives of ten men depended, he would not have handed it over without taking off his apron.
Every morning, Mother Jouan repeated her story to me: "They were fishing when a squall came up so strong that they had to flee downwind instead of going back to Le Bien-Aimé; they passed by La Prudence without being able to land. But you understand that with a sailor like Jouan there was no danger. They would have found some ship offshore that would have taken them: that's happened many times; that's how Mélanie's boy came back. They may have been landed in America. When they come back, Jérôme will have grown up! He was fourteen; fourteen and then six, how much is that? -- Twenty years. -- Twenty! He'll be a man.
She never admitted that they were lost. She herself died without believing them to be dead, and a few days before she had given the priest three louis to give to Jérôme when he returned: despite need and misery, she had always kept them for her youngest child.

My father's embarkation was supposed to last three years, but it lasted six: the staff was successively replaced, but the entire crew remained in the Pacific until the day the frigate threatened to sink.
I was ten years old when he returned home.
It was a Sunday after High Mass; I was on the jetty to see the customs patrol boat come in. Next to the helmsman was a government sailor, all the more noticeable because he was in his uniform and the customs officers were in their service jackets. Like every day at tide time, the jetty had its usual crowd of old sailors, who, whatever the weather, sun or storm, arrived there two hours before full tide and only left two hours later.
Romain," Captain Houel said to me as he lowered his spyglass, "there's your father. Run to the quay if you want to be there before him.
I really wanted to run, but my legs felt like they were broken. When I got to the quay, the patache was alongside and my father had disembarked. They wanted to take him to the café to buy him a mug of cider.
See you tonight," he said, "I can't wait to kiss my wife and my moss.
- Here's your mousse!
That evening, the weather turned bad, but no one got up at home to light a candle.
During six years of voyages, my father had seen many things, and I was always a willing listener for him. Outwardly impatient and rude, he was, deep down, the most enduring man, and he told me with unflagging complacency not what pleased him, but what pleased my childish imagination.
Among his stories, there was one that I never tired of hearing and that I always asked for again: it was the one about my Uncle Jean. During a stopover in Calcutta, my father had heard about a General Flohy, who was on embassy with the English governor. What was said about him was something of a prodigy. He was a Frenchman who had entered the service of the King of Berar as a volunteer; in a battle against the English, he had saved the Indian army with a bold move, which had made him a general; in another battle, a cannonball had taken his hand; He replaced it with a silver one, and when he returned to the capital, holding the reins of his horse with this hand, the priests prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him, saying that in the holy books it was written that the kingdom of Berar would reach its highest degree of power when its armies were commanded by a foreigner from the West, who would be recognised by his silver hand. My father presented himself to this General Flohy and was welcomed with open arms. For eight days my uncle had treated him like a prince, and had wanted to take him to his capital; but the service was inexorable, and we had to stay in Calcutta.
This story made the most vivid impression on my imagination: my uncle occupied all my thoughts, I dreamt only of elephants and palanquins; I kept seeing the two soldiers who accompanied him carrying the silver hands; until then I had had a certain admiration for the Swiss of our church, but these two soldiers who were my uncle's slaves made me pity the iron halberd and the gallooned hat of our Swiss.
My father was pleased by my enthusiasm; my mother suffered, because with her maternal feeling she could see the effect these stories had on me:
All this," she said, "will give him a taste for travel and the sea...
- Well, then he'll be like me, and why not like his uncle?
Do like my uncle! My poor father didn't know what kind of fire he was lighting.
My mother had to resign herself to the idea that I would be a sailor; but in her ingenious tenderness, she at least wanted to soften the beginnings of this tough job for me. She persuaded my father to give up government service; when he had a command for Iceland, I would do my apprenticeship under him.
By this means, she hoped to keep us ashore during the winter season, when the fishing boats return to port to disarm. But what can human combinations and forecasts do against destiny?
III
My father returned in August; in September, the weather, which had been fine for more than three months, turned bad; there was a series of hurricanes as there had been a series of calms. There was nothing but talk of shipwrecks on our coasts; a steamer had been lost body and soul in the Raz Blanchard; several boats from Granville had disappeared, and it was said that the sea around Jersey was covered in debris; on land, the paths were cluttered with broken branches; Many apple trees had their roots up in the air or were twisted through the middle of their trunks, and the leaves were hanging from the branches, scorched as if they had been exposed to a straw fire. 
Everyone lived in fear, because it was time for the Terreneuviers to return.
I thought the storm had passed, but at supper my father laughed at me when I asked him if we wouldn't go the next day to pick up the nets that had been set since the beginning of the bad weather.
Tomorrow," he said, "the gale will blow due west; the sun has set in a red mist, there are too many stars in the sky, the sea is moaning, the land is hot; you will see more than you have yet seen.
So the next day, instead of going out to sea, we set to hauling stones on the roof of the deckhouse. The westerly wind had risen with the day; there was no sun, a dirty sky, lit from place to place by long green lines, and although the sea was low, in the distance there was a dull sound like a howl.
Suddenly my father, who was on the roof of the deckhouse, stopped his work and I climbed up beside him. Off in the distance, on the horizon, we could see a small white dot against the dark sky: it was a ship.
"If they're not damaged, they must want to get lost," said my father.
In fact, in westerly winds, Port-Dieu is inaccessible.
It was lightning that had shown us the ship. It disappeared almost immediately. The clouds piled up in a black confusion; they rose quickly, mixed together, rolling like swirls of smoke escaping from a fire; the extreme curvature of the horizon was the focus from which they burst.
We went down to the village; people were already running towards the pier, because everyone knew that there was a ship in sight, in other words in danger.
In the distance as well as at our feet, to the right and to the left, all around us, the sea was nothing but foam, a moving snow; it rose faster than usual with a dull noise which, mixed with the storm, paralysed our hearing; the clouds, although driven by a furious wind, were so low, so heavy, that they seemed to press with all their weight on this soapy foam. The ship had grown; she was a brig; her canvas was almost dry.
"Captain Houel, who had his spyglass with him, said: "Now he's hoisting his handlebar, it's the Leheu brothers'.
The Leheu brothers were the richest shipowners in the country.
"He asked for the pilot.
- Ah, yes, the pilot; we should be able to get out.
It was the pilot himself, Father Housard, who replied; and as there were only people from the trade there, there was no reply; they knew he was right and that it was impossible to get out.
At the same moment, the eldest of the Leheu brothers arrived from the village. He certainly didn't know how strong the wind was, because no sooner had he rounded the corner of the last house than he spun round and was thrown into the street like a bundle of clothes. As best he could, stumbling, whirling, stinging in the wind, like a swimmer in a wave, he reached the battery behind which we were sheltered; on the way he lost his hat without trying to run after it, and everyone could see that he was terribly tormented, for he was known never to lose anything.
We knew in a minute that the brig belonged to him, it had been built in Bayonne, it was fitted out by a Basque crew, it was his first voyage; it was not insured.
Twenty sous a barrel if you take it in," said M. Leheu, pulling Father Housard by his stern.
- To fetch it, you'd first have to be able to get out.
The waves were leaping over the jetty; the wind had become like an immense sweep, carrying with it the foam from the waves, the seaweed, the sand from the parapet, the tiles from the guardhouse; the broken clouds were trailing into the sea, and the soapy whiteness of the latter made them even blacker.
When the brig saw that the pilot wasn't coming out, it half tacked to try and get a run in while waiting.
Waiting meant certain shipwreck; going in meant even more certain shipwreck.
People were pouring in from the village; at any other time, it would have been a laughable spectacle to see the holes the wind was making in the groups; as it lifted them up, it jostled them; there were women lying on the ground trying to move forward by dragging themselves along on their knees.
Mr Leheu kept shouting: "Twenty sous a barrel, forty sous! He came and went, ran and, in the same second, went from pleas to insults.
"You're all the same, at sea when you're not needed; in bed when there's danger.
No one answered: they just shook their heads or turned away.
He became exasperated:
"You're all nothing; that's three hundred thousand francs lost; you're cowards.
My father stepped forward:
"Give me a boat and I'll go.
- You, Kalbris, are a brave man.
- If Kalbris goes, I'll go too," said Father Housard.
- Twenty sous a barrel, I'll pay it," shouted M. Leheu. Leheu.
- Nothing," said Père Housard, "it's not for you; but if I stay there and my old lady asks you for two sous on Sunday, don't refuse her.
- Kalbris," said M. Leheu, "I'll adopt your lad.
- That's not all; we need the boat at Gesseaume.
This boat, called the Saint-Jean, was famous all along the coast for carrying canvas well in all weathers.
I don't mind," said Gesseaume, yielding to all eyes on him, "but I'm lending it to Kalbris and he has to bring it back to me.
My father took me by the hand; we ran towards the hold where the Saint-Jean was dry: in a minute she was stripped of her sail and rudder.
In addition to my father and the pilot, we needed a third sailor, and one of our cousins turned up.
"Kalbris is doing well," he said.
My father took me in his arms, and in a voice whose accent I still remember:
You don't know," he said as he kissed me, "but you can tell your mother that I'm kissing her.
Getting out of the harbour with this headwind was the great difficulty; the hauliers pulling on the Saint-Jean's mooring line didn't make any headway, there were jolts that made them let go and scattered them, jostling them. The very tip of the jetty was swept by the waves; however, the Saint-Jean had to be hauled up outside this point to catch the wind. The lighthouse keeper tied a grelin round his waist and, while the waves were keeping the Saint-Jean in the channel as best they could, he stooped over the parapet and stepped forward, holding the iron railing attached to it with both hands. He had no intention, as you can well see, of single-handedly pulling out the boat, which fifty arms could barely carry, but only, and this was hard work, of passing the mooring rope around the bronze pulley at the end of the jetty, so that the boat, finding its point of support there, could move forward in the opposite direction to the oncoming waves. Three times he was covered by the wave, but he was used to these avalanches of water; he resisted and managed to roll up the grelin. The Saint-Jean began to make slow progress again, plunging so heavily into the waves that it was as if they were going to fill her. Suddenly the mooring line eased and came of its own accord; it had been cast off and the Saint-Jean was rounding the jetty.
I jumped onto the glacis of the battery and hugged the signal mast so tightly with my arms and legs that I was able to hold on to it; it bent and creaked as if, still alive, it had been swinging on its roots in the forest of its birth.
I saw my father at the helm, and next to him the two men were leaning against the planking, their backs to the wind. The Saint-Jean jerked forward; sometimes it stopped, sometimes it sped along like a cannonball ricocheting through foamy waves; sometimes it disappeared entirely in the dusty water that sailors call sea spray.
As soon as the brig saw it, it changed course and steered straight for the lighthouse; as soon as the Saint-Jean was high enough in the wind, it also changed tack and steered to cut off the brig; in a few minutes they joined up: the boat passed under the bowsprit of the big ship and almost immediately swung round; they were attached to each other.
The trailer won't hold," said a voice. -- When it does, they'll never be able to get alongside the brig," said another.
It seemed impossible that the Saint-Jean could get close enough to the brig to allow Father Housard to climb in: either the Saint-Jean would be crushed or Father Housard would fall overboard.
Joined together, carried in the same gust, pushed by the same wave, the ship and the boat approached. When the bowsprit plunged, you could see the deck rise up and the crew, unable to keep their footing, clung on wherever they could.
"Get in, get in", shouted Mr Leheu.
Father Housard had already tried three or four times to jump in, but the two ships had separated violently: the boat, launched twenty or thirty metres at the end of the tow, went ahead, behind, at the mercy of the waves that carried it along. Finally, the brig swerved to the side of the Saint-Jean, and when the wave that had lifted her lowered, the pilot was clinging to her side on the pennant-holder.
It seemed as if the wind had overcome all resistance, levelled, demolished and swept away the obstacles: it passed over us and through us irresistibly, without those intervals of rest and resumption which leave at least a moment to breathe. All we could feel was a violent push, always in the same direction; all we could hear was a deafening gasp. Under this flattening, the waves were lifted before they were formed; they collapsed on top of each other in whirlpools.
The brig arrived as fast as the storm itself, carrying just enough canvas to steer. Although the sea appeared to be flat, she was rolling and pitching furiously from side to side as if she were about to turn: in the middle of one of these jolts, all that could be seen were shreds of canvas; her topsail had been swept away; with no point of support for steering, she came abeam: she was barely two or three hundred metres from the entrance.
The same cry came from every chest.
The Saint-Jean, aboard which my father and cousin had stayed, followed the brig at a short distance; to avoid colliding with this mass, it took to the open sea, but at the same time a staysail was hoisted aboard the brig; it returned to the channel, once again cutting off the boat, which it completely masked with its black mass. Two seconds later, it entered the channel.
It was the boat I was following much more than the brig: when I looked for it, the brig having entered, I no longer saw it. Then almost immediately I saw it outside the jetty; hampered by the manoeuvring of the big ship, it had missed the narrow channel, and was running towards a sort of cove to the right of the jetty, where usually, on stormy days, the sea is less troubled.
But that day, as everywhere else, as far as the eye could see, the sea was furious, and it was absolutely impossible to go upwind to let the boat go down. The sail was brought up, an anchor was dropped, and to the waves that rushed in from the open sea the dinghy presented the bow; between it and the beach stood a line of rocks that would not be covered with water for another half hour. Would the anchor hold? Would the rope not be cut? Would the Saint-Jean still be able to rise above the waves without diving?
I was only a child, but I had enough experience of things at sea to calculate the horrible length of this wait.
Around me, I could also hear these questions being asked, because we had run out onto the shore and grouped ourselves in piles to resist the wind:
"If they still hold out, they may run aground; if the Saint-Jean comes to full tide, it will be smashed to smithereens.
- Kalbris is a tough swimmer.
- Oh yes, swimming!
A plank itself would have been swallowed up in the whirlpools of water, grass, stones and foam that were crashing onto the beach, where they were digging holes. The waves, pushed back by the rocks, produced a backwash which, as they receded, met those coming from the open sea, and so pressed together they rose on top of each other and tumbled down in cascades.
As I stood there panting, my eyes on the Saint-Jean, I was grabbed by both arms; I turned round; it was my mother running to me, distraught; she had seen everything from the top of the cliff.
Captain Houel and a few others surrounded us; they talked to us, tried to reassure us: without answering anyone, my poor mother looked out to sea.
Suddenly a loud cry dominated the noise of the storm:
"The anchor has dropped!
My mother fell to her knees and dragged me with her.
When I looked up again, I saw the Saint-Jean coming abeam over the crest of a huge wave; lifted up, carried by it, it went over the barrier of rocks; but the wave dug in to bring it down; the boat stood upright, spinning, and all I could see was a sheet of foam.
It was only two days later that my father's horribly mutilated body was found; my cousin's was never found.
IV
For six years, my father's place had been empty at the end of the table, but it was not the dreadful, bleak emptiness that followed this catastrophe.
His death did not reduce us to absolute poverty, for we had our own house and a little land, but my mother had to work for a living.
She had once been the best ironer in the country, and as the Port-Dieu bonnet is one of the most beautiful hairstyles on the coast, she found new work.
The Leheu brothers thought they had to come to our aid.
- My brother will take you on every fortnight," said the eldest to my mother, "and so will I every fortnight; one insured day every week, that's something.
And that was all. It wasn't much to pay for a man's life.
At the time I'm talking about, the working day was based on the sun; so in the mornings and evenings, before and after school, I had hours when, in my mother's absence, I could do what I liked.
What I liked to do was stroll along the pier or the shore, depending on whether the sea was high or low. Everything my poor mother tried to keep me at home was useless; I always had reasons to escape or justify myself; happy still when I didn't have any to play truant, that is to say when the ships weren't coming back from Newfoundland, when there wasn't a big tide, when there wasn't heavy weather.
It was on one of these days of high tide and truancy that I had an encounter that had a major influence on my character and decided my life.
It was the end of September, and the Friday tide was going to uncover rocks that hadn't been seen for a long time. On Friday morning, instead of going to school, I fled to the cliffs where, while waiting for the sea to go down, I had lunch: I had more than two hours to wait.
The tide was coming in like a flood, and if you looked away from a rock for a moment, you'd never find it again; it had been drowned in the wave, which was rising so calmly that it was the rock itself that seemed to have sunk to the bottom; Not a wave, but only a line of foam between the blue sea and the yellow sand; out to sea, beyond the arched horizon of the waters, the gaze was lost in grey depths; they could see further than usual; on the coast, Cape Vauchel and the Aiguille d'Aval, which only happens in great changes of weather. 
The sea remained calm for a long time, much to my impatience, then finally began to recede with the same speed as it had come. I followed it; I had hidden my basket and my clogs in a hole and I walked barefoot on the shore, where my footsteps dug a stain that filled with water.
Our beaches are generally sandy; however, here and there you come across piles of rocks that the sea, in its erosive work, has not yet been able to wear away and which form blackish islets at low tide. As I was standing on one of these islets chasing crabs under the wrack, I heard myself calling out.
Those who are at fault are not very brave, I was frightened for a moment; but when I looked up I saw that I had nothing to fear, the man who had hailed me was not going to send me back to school: he was an old man with a white beard whom in the country we called Monsieur Dimanche, because he had a servant whom he called Samedi. His real name was M. de Bihorel and he lived on a small island a quarter of an hour from the Port-Dieu; in the past this island had been on land, but he had had the granite causeway that formed the isthmus cut away and thus transformed it into a real island, which the sea, when it was high, washed on all sides. He had the reputation of being the greatest original in existence for twenty leagues around; and this reputation he owed to a huge umbrella that he always carried stretched over his head, to the absolute solitude in which he lived, and above all to a mixture of harshness and kindness in his relations with the locals.
- Hey, kid," he shouted, "what are you doing here?
- As you can see, I'm looking for crabs.
- Well, leave your crabs and come with me, you'll be carrying my net and you won't be sorry.
I didn't answer, but my face spoke for me.
- Ah! ah! you don't want to?
- It's that...
- Shut up, I'll tell you why you don't want to; just tell me your name.
- Roman Kalbris.
- You are the son of Kalbris, who died to save a brig last year; your father was a man.
I was proud of my father; these words made me look at Mr de Bihorel less slyly.
- You're nine years old," he continued, putting his hand on my head and looking into his hands, "today's Friday, it's midday, you're playing truant.
I looked down, blushing.
- You're playing truant," he continued, "that's not hard to guess; now I'm going to tell you why. Don't tremble, you little ninny, I'm no sorcerer. Come on, look at me. You want to take advantage of the tide to fish.
-- Yes, sir, and to see the Dog's Head.
The Dog's Head is a rock that is rarely uncovered.
-- Well, I'm going to the Dog's Head too; take my net and follow me.
I followed him without saying a word, stunned that he had guessed me so easily. Although I knew him well, it was the first time I had exchanged so many words with him, and I did not know that his pleasure was to seek out the secret motive behind the actions of those with whom he found himself; great finesse and long experience often made him hit the nail on the head, and, as he feared no one, he always spoke his mind whatever the impression, whether gracious or hurtful.
Although I had little desire to do so, I had to talk, or at least answer the questions he kept asking me. I hadn't been walking behind him for a quarter of an hour before he knew everything I could tell him about myself, my father, my mother and my family. What I told him about my uncle the Indian seemed to interest him.
- Curious," he said, "spirit of adventure, Norman blood mixed with Phoenician blood; where can Calbris or Kalbris come from?
This questioning didn't stop him from examining the shore on which we were advancing, and from time to time picking up shells and herbs that I had to put in the net.
- What do you call that?" he said to me at every turn.
I was almost always speechless, because although I knew the herbs and shells by sight, I didn't know their names.
- You're a son of your country," he said impatiently. "For you people, the sea is only good for plundering and ravaging, it's the eternal enemy you have to defend yourself against; you'll never see that it's as nourishing a mother as the earth, and that the forests that cover its plains and mountains are inhabited by more animals than our forests on land! This infinite horizon, these clouds, these waves will never speak to you of anything but hurricanes and shipwrecks!
He spoke with a vehemence that stunned my childish shyness, and it is the impression of his words that I am giving you rather than his words themselves, for I remembered poorly what I hardly understood; but the impression stayed with me so vividly that I can still see him under his umbrella, stretching out his arm over the high seas and drawing my eyes with his.
- Come here," he continued, pointing to a crack in the rock where the water hadn't receded, "so I can show you what the sea is all about. What's that?
He pointed to a sort of small tawny stem stuck at the base to a stone and ending in a sort of yellow corolla whose edges, cut into strips, were as white as snow.
- Is it a grass or a beast? You don't know, do you? Well, it is a beast; if we had time to stay here, you might see it come off, and you know very well that flowers don't walk. Look closely and you'll see what looks like a flower lengthening, shortening and swaying. This is what scientists call a sea anemone. But to make sure you're convinced it's an animal, try catching me a prawn. You know that flowers don't eat, right?
Saying this, he took the prawn and threw it into the corolla of the anemone; the corolla closed and the prawn disappeared.
In a hole full of water, I caught a small ray: it had buried its fins in the sand to hide, but its brown and white spots made it visible to me; I took it to M. de Bihorel.
- You found this ray," he told me, "because it is mottled, and the fact that you found it means that it is also a danger to voracious fish. Now, since there is a general war at the bottom of the sea in which people kill each other, as happens all too often on land, simply for pleasure and glory, these poor rays, which swim badly, would soon be exterminated if nature had not provided for it; Look at the tail of your ray, it is bristling with thorns and stings, so that when it runs away it cannot be attacked from there, and the enemies that its spots attract must stop in front of its armour. This is a law of universal equilibrium that you can see today and understand later.
I was amazed; you can understand what effect this demonstrative lesson had on a naturally curious and questioning child, who had never found anyone to answer him. The fear that had initially closed my mouth quickly dissipated.
Still following the receding tide, we reached the Tête de chien. How long we stayed there, I don't know. I was no longer conscious of time. I ran from rock to rock, bringing back to Mr de Bihorel any shells or plants I saw for the first time. I filled my pockets with a heap of things that seemed very curious at the time I found them and which I soon threw away to replace them with others that had the undeniable superiority of being new.
Suddenly, when I looked up, I could no longer see the coast; it had disappeared in a light fog; the sky was a uniform pale grey; the sea was so calm that we could hardly hear it behind us.
If I had been alone, I would have gone back, for I knew how difficult it is, in foggy weather, to find one's way among the shores; but as M. de Bihorel said nothing, I didn't dare say anything either.
However, the fog, which enveloped the whole coast, came towards us like a cloud of smoke rising from the earth straight up to the sky.
- Ah! ah! there's the fog," said M. de Bihorel; "if we don't want to play a game of colin-maillard that's a bit too serious, we'll have to get back: take the net.
But almost immediately the cloud reached us, overtook us, and we could see nothing, neither the coast nor the sea, which was fifty paces behind us; we were plunged into a grey darkness.
- The sea is there," said M. de Bihorel unconcernedly, "all we have to do is go straight ahead.
Going straight ahead on the sand, with nothing to guide us, no ruts, no tracks of any kind, not even a slope to indicate whether we were going up or down, was like playing the green carpet game at Versailles, in which you have to go blindfolded from Latona's parterre to Apollo's basin without deviating and without walking on the sand; with the aggravating circumstance that we had at least half a league to go before finding the cliffs.
We hadn't even been walking for ten minutes when we were stopped by a mass of rocks.
-- That's the Pierres Vertes," I said.
- It's the Pouldu," said M. de Bihorel.
-- It's the Green Stones, sir.
He gave me a peck on the cheek:
- Ah! ah! it seems that we have a good little noggin, he said.
If it was the Pierres Vertes, we'd have to go along them to the right and get closer to the Port-Dieu; if, on the other hand, it was the Pouldu, we'd have to go left, otherwise our backs would be to the village.
In daylight, nothing is easier than to distinguish these two rocks; even at night, in the light of the moon, I could easily have recognised them; but, in the fog, we could see the stones covered in kelp and that was that.
- Let's listen," said M. de Bihorel, "the sound of the coast will guide us.
We heard nothing, neither the sound of the coast nor the sound of the sea. There was not a breath of wind. It was as if we were immersed in a white cotton wool that blocked our ears as well as our eyes.
- It's Le Pouldu," said M. de Bihorel.
I didn't dare contradict him any further and followed him, turning left as he did.
- Come close to me, my child," he said in a gentle voice, "give me your hand so that we don't get separated; one, two, let's walk at a pace.
We walked for another ten minutes or so, and then I felt his hand squeezing mine. There was a faint splash. We'd made a mistake, it was the Green Stones; we were heading straight for the sea and we were only a few steps away.
- You were right," he said, "we should have turned right; let's go back.
Go back where? Where should we go? We knew where the sea was because we could hear the waves gently breaking, but as we got further away we couldn't hear anything, and we didn't know whether we were turning our backs on the coast or facing it.
The darkness became more and more opaque, as the fog became thicker and darker. We hadn't been able to see the tips of our feet for some time now, and it was hardly that Mr de Bihorel could make out the time on his watch. It was six o'clock; the tide was about to start coming in.
- We must hurry," he said; "if the tide catches us, it will go faster than us; it has seven-league boots.
He sensed from the trembling of my hand that I was afraid.
- Don't be afraid, my child, the wind will rise from the land and push the fog out to sea; besides, we'll be able to see the lighthouse, which will soon be lit.
There was nothing in that to reassure me; I knew we wouldn't be able to see the lighthouse. For a few minutes I had been thinking about three women who, the previous year, like us, had been surprised on this shore by the fog and had been drowned; their corpses had been found only eight days later; I had seen them brought back to Port-Dieu, and now I had them there before my eyes, dreadful in their poor greenish rags.
Although I wanted to hold back, I started to cry. Without getting angry, M. de Bihorel tried to calm me with kind words.
- Let's shout," he said; "if there's a customs officer on the cliff, he'll hear us and answer us.
We shouted, he in a loud voice, I in a voice laced with sobs. Nothing answered us, not even the echo; and this dreary silence made me even more frightened; it seemed to me that I was dead at the bottom of the water.
- Let's walk," he said; "can you walk?
He took me by the hand, and we walked on. From the words he spoke to me from time to time to encourage me, I could see that he was worried too, and had no confidence in his own words.
After more than half an hour's walking, despair overcame me completely, and, letting go of his hand, I let myself fall onto the sand.
- Leave me here, sir, to die," I said, crying.
- Come on, then!" he said, "now there's another tide; will you get your tears in? Come on, get up, come on.
But even that was useless; I couldn't move.
Suddenly I let out a scream.
- Mister! Mister!
- Well, my child?
- There, there, get down.
- Do you want me to carry you, poor child?
- No, sir, feel.
And taking his hand, I laid it flat beside mine.
- Well, sir?
- Can you smell it?
Our beaches are made up of very fine, deep, spongy sand; at low tide, this sand, which has soaked up water like a sponge, drains away, and the water comes together to form small, almost invisible nets, which follow the slope of the land to the sea. It was one of these little nets that my hand had crossed.
- The coast is there, and I stretched out my arm in the direction from which the water was coming.
At the same time I got to my feet; hope had given me back my legs; Mr de Bihorel didn't need to drag me.
I was going forward; every minute I bent down to stick my hand on the beach and, by the direction of the water, to go upstream.
- You're a good lad," said M. de Bihorel; "without you, I think we would have been lost.
He hadn't even let his fears slip five minutes before it seemed to me that I'd run out of water. We took a few more steps and my hand came to rest on the dry sand.
- There's no more water.
He bent down and felt around with both hands; all we could feel was wet sand clinging to our fingers.
At the same time, I thought I heard a gentle splash. Mr de Bihorel heard it too.
- You will be mistaken," he said, "we are walking towards the sea.
- No, sir, I assure you; and besides, if we approached the sea, the sand would be wetter.
He said nothing and stood up. We remained undecided, lost once again. He pulled out his watch; it was far too dark to see the hands, but he rang it: it struck three quarters past six.
- The tide had been coming in for over an hour.
- So, sir, you can see we're getting closer to the coast.
As if to confirm my reasoning, we heard a dull hum behind us; there was no mistaking it, it was the incoming tide.
-- That was a nau," he said.
- I believe it was, sir.
It's precisely because these beaches are made of shifting sand that they don't stay perfectly flat. Small mounds form here and there, separated from each other by small valleys; all this is more or less flat to the eye, so slight are the differences in level, but perfectly sensitive to the water, so that when the tide rises it is the valleys that fill up first and the mounds remain dry, forming islands, beaten on one side by the rising tide, surrounded on all sides by the water that runs through the valleys as if in a river bed. We were facing one of these rivers. How deep was it? That was the whole point.
-- We have to get past the water," said M. de Bihorel; "hold me tight.
And as I hesitated:
- Are you not afraid of getting wet," he said, "your feet or your head? Choose; I prefer my feet.
- No, sir, we're going to get lost in the water.
- Do you want to stay here and be taken by the sea?
- No, but you go first, I'll stand here shouting, you'll go against my voice; when you're on the other side, you'll shout back and I'll go on top of you.
- You go first.
- No, I can swim better than you.
- You're a good little boy, come and let me give you a kiss.
And he kissed me as if I had been his son; it moved my heart.
There was no time to lose, the sea was coming in fast; second by second you could hear it blowing louder. He entered the water and I began to scream.
- Don't shout," said M. de Bihorel, whom I could no longer see, "sing instead if you can.
- Yes, sir, and I began to sing:
He was born in Normandy;
He was named Rageau.
His beauty, from his cradle
Everyone envied him.
Tra la, la, tra la, la.
I interrupted myself.
- Are you on your feet, sir?
- Yes, my child, I seem to be getting back on my feet; sing.
Her lips were ruddy
Like turnip blood;
His mouth stopped
Until she met his ears.
Tra la, la, tra la, la.
I was about to sing the third verse of this round.
- It's your turn," shouted M. de Bihorel, "I'm only knee-deep in water, come on!
And he sang a wordless tune that was as sad as a death song.
I got into the water, but I wasn't Mr Bihorel's size and soon lost my footing; it was nothing for me, I could swim like a fish. However, the current made it difficult for me to keep a straight course, and it took me more than a quarter of an hour to reach him.
When I reached him, it wasn't long before we were completely out of the water and on the sand.
He breathed with a satisfaction that showed me how anxious he had been...
- Let's have a catch," he said, "we've earned it.
But no sooner had he reached his snuffbox than he gave an exclamation, shaking his fingers.
- My tobacco which has turned into coffee grounds and my watch which, of course, turns like a mill wheel in water, what will Samedi say?
I don't know what it was all about, but I was no longer afraid at all. It seemed to me that the danger had passed.
It wasn't, and we still had further to go than we had done; we were surrounded by the same dangers and we had the same difficulties navigating.
The fog seemed to have thickened still further; night had come, and although we were closer to the cliff, we could hear no sound on this side that would tell us: "The land is there," not the bellowing of a cow, nor the crack of a whip, nor the creaking of an axle, nothing: a heavy silence ahead of us; behind us, the continuous, dull roar of the rising sea.
That was our only compass now, but it was an uncertain and treacherous one. If we moved too fast, we could get lost; if we didn't move fast enough, the tide threatened to reach us and swallow us up before we reached the pebble, where the faster slope would slow its course.
So we started walking again, holding hands; I often bent down to feel the sand, but I could no longer find any running water: we were on a bank cut by small ripples, and the water remained stagnant in the hollows, or else, in small trickles, it spread out parallel to the shore.
The hope that I had had, the nau crossed, was abandoning us, when suddenly we both stopped at the same time. The sound of a bell had torn through the atmosphere that enveloped us.
After an interval of two or three seconds, we heard a second, and soon a third.
It was the Angelus at Port-Dieu; all we had to do was walk in the direction of the sound and we were saved.
Without saying a word to each other, and with one accord, we began to run.
- Let's hurry," said M. de Bihorel. The Angelus won't last long enough; it's too short a prayer, today we should add the litanies to guide us.
With such emotion, running breathlessly, we counted the volleys of the bell! Neither of us spoke, but I understood very well that if it stopped ringing before we reached the pebble, we might have been saved for a few moments only to lose ourselves again.
It stopped; we were still on the sand. Perhaps the pebble was only a few metres away; perhaps we only had to stretch out our leg to touch it; but how could we tell which way? The step we were about to take forward could just as easily have brought us closer to salvation as taken us further away, in which case we would have been thrown back into the middle of the dangers we had just run into.
- Let's stop," said M. de Bihorel, "and let's not take another step adventurously; feel the sand, my child.
I felt; I stuck both my hands on the shore, I waited; I raised them both dry.
-- Did you count how much nausea we were going through?
- No, sir, I haven't.
- Then you don't know if we've still got any to go through; if we've gone through them all, all we have to do is wait; when the sea comes, we'll walk slowly ahead of it.
- Yes, but what if we haven't got through them all?
He didn't answer, because he only had to tell me what I knew as well as he did; that is, if we still had a nau between us and the pebble, and if we didn't move forward, the sea would slowly fill it; we would have to swim past it and expose ourselves to being swept away by the current, perhaps thrown into the rocks from which we could never get out.
We had a moment of terrible anxiety, standing there, not knowing what to do, not daring to decide whether to go forwards, backwards, to the right or to the left, because by remaining motionless in the same position where we had stopped hearing the bell, we were at least sure that the country was there before us, as if we had seen it in a clear day, whereas if we took a single step, we would be left with all the anguish of uncertainty.
Our only hope now was that a gust of wind would sweep away the fog and let us see the lighthouse, because we couldn't count on hearing any noise from the coast; we thought we were south of the village, in front of a deserted cliff from which, at such an hour, no noise could come; But the atmosphere was so calm, so heavy, the fog so compact, so solid, that to believe in a breeze you had to be in a position like ours, where you end up hoping for the impossible and waiting for a miracle. 
The miracle happened; the bell, which had stopped ringing, started to chime again.
There was a christening, and on this occasion we were quite sure of arriving, as the chimes at a christening often last half an hour and sometimes more, when the godfather has arranged to give the bell-ringer some strength.
In less than five minutes we reached the pebble, and, climbing it, skirting the foot of the cliff, we came to the causeway that joined Mr de Bihorel's island to the land. We were saved...
Mr de Bihorel wanted to let me into his house, but despite all his entreaties I refused. I was in a hurry to get home, where my mother might already be.
- Well, tell your mother I'll go and see her tomorrow evening.
I would have liked him not to pay us this visit, which was going to tell my mother where I had spent my day, but how could I prevent it?
My mother hadn't come home yet; when she arrived, she found me in dry clothes by the fire I'd lit.
I carried out Mr de Bihorel's request.
The next evening, as he had promised, he arrived; I was watching for him; when I heard his footsteps, I wanted to run away.
- Did that boy tell you what he did yesterday?" he said to my mother, after sitting down.
- No, he didn't, sir.
- Well, he was playing truant all day.
My poor mother looked at me with painful concern, thinking she was about to hear a whole indictment of me.
- Ah, Romain," she said sadly.
- Don't scold him too much," interrupted M. de Bihorel, "because at the same time he saved my life. Come on, don't tremble like that, my boy, and come here. You have a good child, Madame Kalbris, you should be proud.
He told how he had found me the day before, and how we had been surprised by the fog.
- You can see that without him," he continued, "I would have been lost, wouldn't I, my dear lady? In the morning I was angry at his ignorance, because he didn't know the name of an actinia. But when the danger arrived, my science was no longer of any use to me; and if I hadn't had the instinct of this child to help me, the actinids, crabs and lobsters would be studying my anatomy right now. So I've contracted a debt with your son, and I want to repay it.
My mother made a gesture.
- Don't worry," he said without letting himself be interrupted, "I don't want to offer you anything that isn't worthy of your pride and the service I've received. Give him to me and I'll take care of his education; I have no children of my own and I love them, so he won't be unhappy with me.
My mother welcomed this proposal as she should have done, but she did not accept.
- You love this child passionately, you love him for himself and for his father whom you have lost, he is now everything to you and you want to keep him. Now I'm going to tell you why you should give him to me nonetheless: there's an intelligence in him that just needs to be cultivated; at Port-Dieu, that's not possible, and, without getting into your business, I don't think it's possible for you to send him elsewhere; add that the child has an independent and adventurous character that needs to be supervised. Think about it; don't answer me straight away, think it over with a clear head, when the first movements of your maternal heart have calmed down; I'll come back tomorrow evening.
When he had gone, we began to dine, but my mother did not eat; she looked at me for a long time, then, when my eyes met hers, she turned away towards the fire.
When I said goodbye to her before going to bed, I felt her tears wet my cheeks. Who was making them flow? Was she proud of me for what Mr de Bihorel had said? Was she in despair about our separation?
All I could think about at that moment was the separation, which was also troubling me.
- Don't cry, Mama," I said, kissing her, "I won't leave you.
- Yes, my child, it's for your own good; Mr de Bihorel is so right, you must accept.
V
My reception at Mr de Bihorel's justified his reputation for originality, which I had heard so much about.
When I arrived, I found him standing in front of the door of the house, having seen me from a distance and having come to meet me.
- Come here," he said, without giving me time to recognise myself. Have you ever written a letter? No. Well, you're going to write one to your mother to tell her that you've arrived and that Samedi will fetch your clothes tomorrow. This letter will tell me what you know. Come in and stand there.
He took me into a large room full of books, showed me a table with paper, quill pens and ink, and left me.
I felt more like crying than writing, because this abruptness, coming down on me after the emotion of the separation, was suffocating me; nevertheless I tried to obey. But I dirtied my paper with more tears than ink, because, although this was my first letter, I felt that "I have arrived and Saturday will fetch my laundry tomorrow" was a bit short, but I couldn't think of anything else.
For a quarter of an hour I had been crushed under this unfortunate sentence, which wouldn't get any longer, when my attention was distracted by a conversation in the next room between M. de Bihorel and Samedi.
- So," said Samedi, "the child has arrived.
- Did you think he wouldn't come?
- I thought it would change everything around here.
- How?
- Will the child wait until midday to eat, or will he drink the drop with me?
-- You're crazy with your gout.
- Lady! I've never nursed a child.
- You were a child once, weren't you? Well, remember those days and treat him as you were treated yourself.
- Ah, but no, there's no need for that in your house; I was brought up the hard way; if you want to bring him up like that, you'd better send him home. Don't forget that you owe the boy something.
- Never forget that yourself and act accordingly.
- Then give him the drop with sugar.
- You'll give him what you liked at his age; or rather you'll ask him what he wants.
- If you put him on that footing, he'll be fine.
- Saturday, do you know what children are for?
- They're no good for anything except wreaking havoc and damnation on the world.
- But they're good for something else too: they're good for starting our lives again when they've gone astray; they're good for achieving what we've missed out on.
Almost immediately he returned.
- You don't know anything," he said, reading my letter, "so much the better; you won't have to dig it up before planting it. Now go for a walk.
It was truly a singular dwelling, this island, which they called the Pierre-Gante, and such as I have never seen anything like it.
From the shore, the island appears as an amphitheatre in the shape of an elongated triangle, the longest and lowest point of which is separated from the mainland by a small arm of water barely four hundred metres wide. Everything that slopes towards the coast is covered in greenery, grass and shrubs, broken only here and there by a few grey granite needles; everything that looks out to sea is bare, peeled back, burnt by the winds and the salt.
The house is situated at the top of the island, at the very spot where the slopes meet to form a small plateau, and although, by virtue of its position, it enjoys a circular view that embraces the horizon both on land and at sea, it is, on the other hand, exposed to the full force of the winds, whichever way they blow. But the winds can do nothing against it, because, built under the ministry of Choiseul to oppose the landings of the English and to link up with the many guardhouses on the coast, it has granite walls several feet thick and a bomb-proof roof. When Mr de Bihorel bought this old shanty, he surrounded it on the outside with a gallery to brighten it up and make it bigger, and converted the inside into a habitable house by adding partitions and doors. He didn't make it comfortable or elegant in this way, but he didn't take away anything of its essential quality, which was to be as solid in the wind as the rock itself, of which it was a part.
These terrible winds, which are the enemy against which we must constantly defend ourselves, are at the same time a blessing for the island. They give it a milder temperature in winter than inland, so that in the hollows of the land, sheltered by rocks or landslides, you can find plants and shrubs that, in less harsh climates, would need the protection of a greenhouse: oleanders, fuchsias and fig trees.
Most of the unevenness was due to nature, but some had been created by M. de Bihorel, who, with Samedi's help, had transformed the island into a large wild garden; only the part exposed to the west had escaped their work; continually mown by the winds and watered by the foam of the waves, it served as pasture for two small Breton cows and some black ewes.
The curious thing about this considerable work of transformation and appropriation was that it had been accomplished by these two men alone, without the help of any labourers.
I had often heard it said in the country that Mr de Bihorel acted in this way out of avarice; when I got to know him, I saw that it was, on the contrary, by virtue of a principle. Man must be self-sufficient," he often repeated, "and I am a living example that this is possible.
He pushed this idea so far in its application that, even for the ordinary, everyday things in life, he had no recourse to outsiders. We ate milk from the cows, vegetables and fruit from the garden, fish caught by Samedi, bread baked at home with flour ground in a small windmill that was undoubtedly M. de Bihorel's masterpiece: the island would have been big enough to produce the wheat needed for the year's provisions and the apples to press the cider.
To be fair, Samedi's share of the work was considerable; he had been a ship's boy, a sailor, a naval officer's servant and a cook on board a whaler, so he had learned all the trades.
The relationship between these two men was not that of a master and servant, but of two partners; they ate at the same table, and the only distinction between them was that Mr de Bihorel was at the top end. Thus organised, this existence had something simple and dignified about it which did not surprise me when I found myself involved in it, but which now still touches and moves me.
- My boy," said Mr de Bihorel to me the day I arrived, "I don't intend to make a gentleman of you, that is to say a notary or a doctor, but quite simply a sailor who is a man. There is more than one way to learn: you can learn by playing and walking around. Is this system to your taste?
This speech was a bit strange for a child like me. Practice explained to me what I hadn't quite understood at first.
I'd been a bit surprised to learn that education could be achieved even through play, because that wasn't how I'd been used to working at school. I was even more surprised when he put me to work that very afternoon.
I accompanied him on his walk along the coast and, as we walked, he got me talking; we had entered a small oak wood.
- What's that?" he said, pointing to some ants crossing the path.
- Ants.
- Yes, but what are they doing?
- They're carrying others.
- Well, you're going to follow them to their anthill; you'll look at them and tell me what you saw; if you don't notice anything that surprises you, you'll come back tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, until you've observed something.
After two days spent around the anthill, I saw that there were ants doing absolutely nothing, while there were others who worked non-stop and even fed the lazy ones.
- That's good," he said when I told him the results of my observations; "you've seen the main thing, that's enough. These ants that do nothing are not sick or disabled, as you think; they are the masters of those that work and are slaves. Without the help of these slaves, they would be unable to fetch their food. This surprises you, but it is the same in our world; there are still some countries where there are men doing nothing who are fed by those who work. If the cause of this idleness were infirmity in the masters, nothing would be more explicable than the work of some and the rest of others: we have to help each other; but this is not so. Among ants, the masters are precisely those who are best suited to things that require strength and courage -- war. We'll go back together to observe these ants, and we'll no doubt see them fighting some great battle. Only the masters take part, and their aim is to conquer slaves. While we wait for you to witness these battles, I'm going to give you an account, in a book by a scholar called Huber, of one of these battles which took place at precisely the same time as another great battle, far more terrible, was being waged five hundred leagues away between men. I don't know if the men that day had better reasons for killing each other, but I do know that the slaughter was appalling. If I myself was not left on that field of death, it was a very close call. We were marching along a river called the Elbe, and on the other side, on the right bank, the Russians had a formidable artillery battery, whose detonations we could hear, but whose devastation we could not see, because we were sheltered by a bend in the river and by a movement of ground. As I walked along, all I could think of was that this day, which could have been the day of my death, because we had to pass under the fire of this artillery, was also the day of my wife's birthday. I thought how happy I would have been to wish her. Suddenly, in the wet ditch where I was walking, I saw a whole trail of forget-me-nots in full bloom at my feet. You mustn't think that in battle things happen as they are depicted in the pictures, with perfect regularity of alignment. We were deployed as skirmishers, in other words we were free to move. Despite the seriousness of the position, the little blue flowers attracted me. I bent down to pick a few sprigs of forget-me-not, and at the same time I felt a terrible wind blow over me, passing a few inches from my head, then I heard a terrible bang and I was hit on the back by a bundle of willow branches. We had arrived in front of the battery and it had just mowed down all my comrades around me. If I had remained standing, without my little bouquet, I would have died like them. Admittedly, I had done well to think of my wife. When I managed to get out from under the willows, Marshal Ney had silenced the Russian cannons.
That evening, still full of the story of the battle of Friedland, I read Huber's account of the battle of the ants. Huber was blind; he looked through the eyes of the most devoted and intelligent of servants, and then dictated to him the most charming book ever written on bees and ants. If Mr de Bihorel had not brought this reading to me in this way, and if he had imposed it on me as a duty instead of giving it to me as a reward, what effect would it have had on a child of my age, as ignorant of everything as I was? Thanks to the way in which he presented it to me, it entered so fully into my prepared mind that even today, despite the years that have passed, I still remember it more sensitively and more clearly than the book I was reading yesterday.
He didn't like books very much. There was one, however, that he put in my hands straight away, but that one was to him what the Bible is to Protestants, the Imitation to a Catholic; it was on this book that he had modelled his life, it was he who had created the Pierre-Gante and the marvels of work that we saw there; It was he who had come up with the idea for the big umbrella, he who had christened Samedi which, out of respect for Robinson, he had not wanted to call Vendredi, -- it was Robinson Crusoe. 
- You'll learn from this," he said as he handed it to me, "what moral strength can do for a man; you'll also learn that if man can single-handedly, through willpower, repeat all human inventions, he mustn't be too proud of his power, because above him there is God. You may not feel at the moment what I'm telling you, but it will come back to you later, and it was necessary to tell you. Besides, if you are not struck by this great teaching, you will do as all readers do, you will take what you like from the book.
I don't know if there are children who can read Robinson in cold blood, but I was transported.
I have to admit, though, that what struck me most was not the philosophical side that had been suggested to me, but the romantic side - the adventures at sea, the shipwreck, the desert island, the savages, the fear, the unknown. My uncle the Indian had a rival.
I found there a kind of justification for my desires. Who among us has not put himself in the shoes of de Foë's hero and asked himself:
- Why shouldn't the same thing happen to me? Why shouldn't I do the same?
It's not just six-month-olds who believe that all you have to do is stretch out your hand to reach for the moon.
Samedi, who knew so many things, couldn't read. Seeing my enthusiasm, he wanted to know about these adventures and asked me to read them to him.
- He will tell them to you," said M. de Bihorel, "and that will be better; you are primitive enough to prefer the story to reading.
Ten years of travelling had given Samedi a certain amount of experience, and he did not accept all my stories without some objections. But I had an answer that did not allow for discussion.
- It's in writing.
- Are you sure, my little Romain?
I took the book and read.
Samedi listened, scratching his nose, then, with the resignation of blind faith:
- I don't mind, though, I've been to the coast of Africa, and I've never seen lions come swimming up to attack ships. I mean!
He had mainly been to the northern seas, and he had kept memories of these voyages with which he paid for my stories.
One year, caught in the ice, they had been forced to winter: for six months they had lived under the snow, and more than half the crew had been buried under the snow; the dogs themselves had died, not from cold or lack of food, but from lack of light; if they had had enough oil to keep the lamps burning all the time, they would have lived. It was almost as beautiful as Robinson, but sometimes it was too beautiful for my credulity.
- Is it written?
Samedi was forced to admit that he hadn't read it, but he had seen it.
- What does that matter, since it's not written?
Such conversations were not of a nature, it must be admitted, to give me the idea of living quietly on land; so my mother, tormented to see my natural inclinations so unfortunately encouraged, wanted to make an attempt with M. de Bihorel.
- My dear lady," he replied, "I'll give you the child back if you think I'm pushing him in a direction you don't want him to go; but you'll never change him completely, he's of the breed of those who seek the impossible; I agree with you that this rarely leads to fortune, but it sometimes leads to great things.
Such is the ingratitude of children that at that moment I would almost gladly have left the Pierre-Gante. Mr de Bihorel had studied the calls of birds, and in these calls he had believed, rightly or wrongly, that he had found a language whose lexicon he had composed; he wanted to teach it to me: I understood absolutely nothing. He wanted to teach it to me, but I understood absolutely nothing. This led to continual occasions of anger for him and tears for me.
But it was a curious thing, this language, and I regret today that I only remembered a few words. Mr de Bihorel said that he was able to translate everything a bird could express fluently: "I'm hungry... eat over there... let's run away quickly... let's make a nest... kia ouah tsioui, here comes the storm". But then I was still too much of a child and too much of a peasant to admit, even as a hypothesis, that animals could speak. We feel the music, which is not our language, and we don't want the birds to understand it, they who gave us the first models! Our dogs, our horses, our domestic animals hear our language; was it therefore completely impossible for M. de Bihorel to hear that of the birds?
My mother, confused by Mr de Bihorel's reply, did not persist in her request, and I had to continue studying the dictionary of the Guillemots and the Pierre Garins.
- You will see later," said M. de Bihorel, "the usefulness of what seems ridiculous to you today. Your mother is afraid you'll become a sailor, but I don't want that either, because these days, if you enter the navy at fifteen with enthusiasm, you often leave it at forty with disgust. But you have a passion for travelling, it's a family vocation for you, and we have to manage to satisfy your vocation and your mother's wishes. So I would like you to be a man like André Michaux, whose life you were reading about the other day; like Siehold, the Dutch doctor who introduced us to Japan; like the Englishman Robert Fortune; I would like to prepare you to travel to little-known countries, for the benefit of your country, which you would enrich with new plants and useful animals, for the benefit of science, of which you would be a soldier. That's better than being a sailor, transporting coffee from Rio-Janeiro to Le Havre and goods from Paris to Rio-Janeiro for the rest of your life, like a shipping agent; and if that happens, you'll see that what I want to teach you today will be of real service to you.
It was a beautiful dream. Unfortunately, it was only a dream. Would this far-sighted and lofty direction have made me the man Mr de Bihorel wanted? I don't know, because it stopped working on me precisely at the moment when it was most necessary and when I was beginning to benefit from the lessons of this excellent man. This is how this sudden catastrophe occurred:
I usually accompanied M. de Bihorel on all his excursions; sometimes, however, he embarked alone in the longboat to study at his leisure the calls of the birds at Grunes Island, which is three leagues off Port-Dieu.
One day when he had left before I got up, we were very surprised not to see him come back at dinner time.
- He'll have missed the tide," said Samedi, "it'll be for tonight's tide.
The weather was calm, the sea calm; there seemed to be no danger. However, Samedi seemed rather worried.
In the evening, Mr de Bihorel did not arrive, and instead of going to bed, Samedi lit a big fire of faggots on the highest point of the island. I wanted to stay with him, but he sent me to bed rather harshly. Towards morning before daybreak, I got up and went to join him. All we could hear was the murmur of the sea; sometimes there was a muffled murmur, the sound of wings, and birds, which had been disturbed by the light in their caves, swooped down in panic on our fire.
A white glow opened up the eastern sky.
- Of course something will have happened to him," said Samedi; "we have to borrow the boat from Gosseaume and go to the Isle of Grunes.
Île des Grunes is a mass of granite rocks inhabited only by seabirds; we soon explored it, but nowhere did we find any trace of M. de Bihorel or the rowboat.
Everyone at Port-Dieu was soon in an uproar, because despite his originality, they loved old M. Dimanche. His disappearance was inexplicable.
- Some said he had capsized.
- The rowboat would be found.
- And the currents?
Samedi said nothing, but all day long he never left the shore; when the tide went out, he followed the flow, and one by one he visited all the rocks; there were evenings when we found ourselves five or six leagues away from the Port-Dieu. He didn't speak, he never pronounced the name of M. de Bihorel; only, when he met a fisherman, he would say to him in a sorrowful voice:
- Anything new?
And the fisherman, who understood this brief interrogation, would reply:
- Nothing new.
And then, if he saw a tear in my eye, he would pat me on the head and say:
- You're a good boy; yes, you're a good boy.
A fortnight after this inexplicable absence, a M. de La Berryais, who lived in Lower Normandy, arrived at La Pierre-Gante. He was a grand-nephew of M. de Bihorel and his only relative.
After telling us at length what had happened, he hired twelve men at Port-Dieu with orders to explore the shore. The search continued for three days, then on the evening of the third day he stopped it, declaring that it was now useless and that Mr de Bihorel had certainly perished; the currents had washed away the body and the boat.
- What do you know?" cried Samedi; "why do you think he's dead? The currents may well have washed away the boat without it capsizing; perhaps the master went ashore in England. Why shouldn't he come back tomorrow?
He had said these words in front of the people who had carried out the search. No one replied out of respect for his grief, but no one agreed with him.
The next day, M. de La Berryais summoned Samedi and me to appear before him, and he told us that no one was needed at Pierre-Gante: the gates would be closed, and the notary would look after the animals until they were sold.
Samedi was so suffocated that he could only stammer unintelligible words:
- Pack your bag," he said, "we're going to get out of here right away.
As we left the island, we met M. de La Berryais on the causeway; Samedi walked straight up to him:
- Sir," he said, "you may well be his nephew by law, but as far as I'm concerned you're not; no, you're not, and it's a real sailor who's telling you that.
It had been agreed that Samedi would stay with my mother until he found somewhere to live in the village, but he didn't stay with us for long.
Every morning he went to the beach and continued his search. This went on for about three weeks, and then one evening he announced that he would be leaving us the next day to go to the English Isles and perhaps England.
- Because, you see," he said, "the sea doesn't keep anything, that's for sure; so if it doesn't give anything back, it's perhaps because it hasn't taken anything.
My mother tried to get him to talk, but he wouldn't say any more.
I took him as far as the sloop, where he boarded.
As I kissed him:
- You're a good boy, he said; you'll go to Pierre-Gante sometimes, and you'll take a handful of salt to the black cow, she liked you too.
VI
I had an uncle in whom the blood of the Kalbris had not spoken, and who, instead of the sea, had preferred dry land; he was a bailiff in Dol, and was said to be very rich.
He was a bailiff in Dol and was said to be very wealthy. My mother, who was very worried about me when I returned home, wrote to him to ask his advice. A month later we saw him arrive at Port-Dieu.
- I didn't reply to your letter," he said, "because, as I intended to come, there was no point in giving the money to the post office, it's hard enough to earn; I didn't come earlier because I was waiting for an opportunity; I found a fishmonger who took me fifteen leagues for twelve sous. So much taken from the enemy.
It's easy to deduce from this language that my uncle Simon was a thrifty man; he soon gave us proof of that.
- You don't want that boy to go to sea; you're right, my sister-in-law, there's nothing to be gained from a dog's job; and you'd rather he finished what he started with old Dimanche. But you didn't count on me for that, did you?
- I never wanted to ask you for money," said my mother with gentle pride.
- I don't have any money. People say I'm rich, but that's not true; I owe everyone. I had to buy an estate, which is ruining me.
- The parish priest explained to me," continued my mother, "that the services and death of the father could get the son into a college without paying.
- And who would take the necessary steps? Not me, you can count on that. I don't have the time and I don't like to tire out the influential people I know, we might need them later. No, there are better things to do than that. The Leheu brothers had promised to take care of the child, and it's up to them to pay for the school.
- They've stopped talking about it.
- Well, I'll talk to them about it.
As my mother was about to interrupt:
- No false delicacy," continued my uncle; "when you ask for what is due, the shame is on the one who lets himself be asked, and not at all on the one who asks.
My mother had to resign herself to this step, against which her uprightness and pride protested; my uncle was a man who could not be resisted.
- You understand," he said in conclusion, "that if I've left my business to look after yours, it's the least I can do for you to do as I advise.
He was also a man who wasted no time.
- You," he said, turning to me, "are going to go straight to Mr Leheu's, and see if they're both at their office; I'll wait for you in the street, and if they're together, we'll go in. I know their ways: if we saw them separately, the one we saw would start by promising everything and asking only to tell his brother, and the other would refuse what the first had granted.
As they were both at their desks, we went in and I witnessed a strange scene, the smallest details of which have remained in my memory: it must have really struck me, because when I went through the door, I had an inch of red on my face; instinctively, it seemed to me that it was a dishonour to my father's devotion to go and ask these selfish people for payment, and shame filled my eyes.
On hearing my uncle's proposal clearly formulated, the two brothers gave every sign of profound astonishment, and shook in their chairs as if they had been sitting on thorns.
- Send him to school!" said the younger.
- To college!" shouted the eldest.
- We, the Leheu brothers!" they shouted at the same time.
- Didn't you promise to adopt him?" replied my uncle.
- Adopt him, me?" said the eldest.
- Adopt him, you?" shouted the young man.
- Adopt him, us? they both shouted.
Then began a confused and deafening discussion: each answer of the younger brother was immediately repeated by the elder, in exactly the same terms, only in a tone ten times higher; one shouted, the other ranted; in the midst of all this uproar, my uncle did not let himself be dismayed, and when the two brothers repeated in chorus: "We are doing more than we promised, we are giving the mother work," he had a dry little laugh that immediately restored calm.
Finally, as they returned to this argument for the fifth or sixth time, he became impatient.
- My word, you're the first people I've met who are so complete. You give, you give... listening to you, one would think you were giving away your fortune, and you give... to work; don't you get your ten cents and your food back in work? Do you pay her mother more than any other worker?
- We pay her in cash," said the young man with a movement of just satisfaction, "and we are willing, yes, we will gladly do it, we are willing not to stop there. When you tell us that Kalbris died to save our fortune, that's not true: He died to save men, sailors like him, who were going to drown; and that, you understand, is not our business, it's the government's; there are funds in the budget for those who amuse themselves with heroism; well, it doesn't matter, when that boy is grown up, when he knows how to work, let him come to us, and we'll give him something to work on, won't we, Jérôme? 
- To work," said the eldest, "and for as long as he wants.
That was all my uncle could get.
- Here are some people..." he said when we had gone out.
I thought I was about to hear an explosion of long-suppressed anger.
- These are admirable people," continued my uncle, stunned to have found someone tougher than he. They know how to say no: remember that word well; it's with him and him alone that you can be sure of keeping what you've earned.
I was very young to fill the position, but if I didn't earn my keep during the first few years, and if I undertook to stay with him for five years without pay, I would compensate him in the end for a little of what I would have cost him initially.
Alas, it wasn't the college that my poor mother had so ardently aspired to, but it was at least a way of preventing me from becoming a sailor: so I left with my uncle. It was a sad departure. I was crying, my mother was crying harder than me, and my uncle, between the two of us, was pushing us as hard as the other.
The aspect of Dol, which is certainly very picturesque for the traveller, produced on me the first gloomy impression that I received from things. It was night when we arrived, and a freezing rain was falling. We had left Port-Dieu in the morning in a fishmonger's carriage going to Cancale, and had got off five or six leagues from the town, making our way across large marshy plains cut here and there by ditches full of water. On top of my grief, I had a hunger that broke my legs; but as my uncle, during that long day, hadn't mentioned stopping to eat, I hadn't dared mention it myself. At last we saw the lights of the town, and after turning down two or three deserted streets, my uncle stopped in front of a tall house with a porch resting on large pillars. He drew out a key and opened a lock; I stepped forward to enter, but he stopped me; the door was still open; he drew a second key from his pocket, then a third very large one; the bolts screamed with a scrap metal noise that I have since found in the theatre in plays where there is a prison, and the door opened. These three locks threw me into a state of fearful amazement; in our house there was only a latch with a string, and in Mr de Bihorel's only a simple key. Why was my uncle taking all these precautions?
He closed the door as he had opened it; then he asked me to give him my hand and guided me in the dark through two rooms which seemed very large to me and in which our footsteps echoed on the stone flagstones as if in a church; there was a strange smell that I did not yet know: that of old parchments and mouldy papers, which forms the atmosphere of court registries and the offices of business people. When the candle was lit, I saw that we were in a sort of kitchen, but so cluttered with sideboards, chests and old black oak chairs that it was impossible to make out its shape or size.
Despite this unpleasant appearance, I was overjoyed: at last we were going to be able to warm up and eat.
- Shall I light the fire?" I said to my uncle.
- A fire!
He answered in such a stiff voice that I didn't dare say I was wet to the skin and my teeth were chattering.
- We'll have supper and go to bed," he said.
And, going to a cupboard, he took a pie of bread, cut two slices, put a little piece of cheese on each, gave me one, put the one he was keeping for himself on a table, put the bread back in the cupboard and locked it.
I don't know what effect a prisoner feels when he hears the lock of his dungeon closing on him, but it can't be much more unpleasant than what I felt at the creaking of the lock of this cupboard. It was quite obvious that I should not ask for a second piece of bread, and yet I would have eaten five or six like the one my uncle had given me.
At the same time, three skinny cats rushed into the kitchen and ran to rub against my uncle's legs: this gave me a little hope; they had come to ask for supper, and with the cupboard open, I would at least have an opportunity to have a second piece of bread cut.
But my uncle didn't open it.
- The lads are thirsty," he said, "let's not let them go mad.
And he gave them water in a bowl.
- Now that you're in charge of the house," he continued, "don't ever let them run out of water, I'll put you in charge of that.
- And what about the food?
- There are enough rats and mice here to feed them; if we gorged them on food, they would become lazy.
Our supper was quickly finished, and my uncle announced that he was going to take me to the room I was to occupy from now on.
The clutter I had noticed in the kitchen was the same on the staircase, which, although extraordinarily wide, was barely accessible. On the steps lay rusty iron andirons, clocks, wooden and stone statues, spit-roasters, earthenware vases, oddly shaped pottery and all sorts of furniture whose names and uses I did not know; On the walls hung frames, pictures, swords and helmets, all in a jumble that I found even more cluttered by the uncertain glow of the small candle that lit our room. What use could all this be to my uncle?
That was the question I kept asking myself without finding an answer, because it was only later that I realised that he had another, much more lucrative profession in addition to that of bailiff.
When he left Port-Dieu as a child, he had gone to Paris to work for an auctioneer, where he had stayed for about twenty years, and from where he had only returned to buy an office in Dol. But in reality the firm was only an accessory, the trade in old furniture and antiques of all kinds was the main thing. Charged by his profession with almost all the sales, in contact with everyone, entering all the houses, he knew the good opportunities and was, better than anyone, in a position to take advantage of them. Under cover of a nominee, he bought for himself anything of art or fancy value, and sold it at a huge profit to the great Paris dealers with whom he was in contact, the Vidalinqs and the Monbro; in this way his house, from the cellar to the attic, was a veritable antiques shop.
Like all the rooms in this old house, which seemed to have been built for giants, the room to which my uncle took me was huge, yet so well filled that he had to show me the bed so that I could see it: On the walls, tapestries with life-size figures; on the ceiling, stuffed animals, a cormorant, a crocodile, its red mouth wide open; in a corner, behind a chest that hid the legs, a suit of armour topped with a helmet as if it had covered a living warrior. 
- Are you afraid?" said my uncle, seeing my fright.
I didn't dare admit it and replied that I was cold.
- Well, hurry up and let me get the light; we're going to bed here without a candle.
I slipped into bed, but no sooner had he closed the door than I called him back. He returned.
The armour had shaken with a sound like scrap metal.
- Uncle, there's a man in the armour.
He approached my bed and looked at me fixedly:
- Make sure you never say such a stupid thing again, or you'll have me to deal with.
For more than an hour, I lay hidden under the damp sheets, trembling with fear, cold and hunger; then finally, after much self-indulgence, I regained some courage, raised my head and opened my eyes. Through two high windows, the moonlight fell into the room and divided it into three compartments: two light, one dark. It was windy outside, the windows were rattling in their leaden mesh, and small white clouds veiled the face of the moon from time to time. I kept my eyes fixed on it for a long time, and I think I would have stared at it all night, for it seemed to me that it was to me what a lighthouse is to sailors, and that as long as it shone I would not be lost, but it rose over the horizon, and without any darkness coming into the room, it disappeared at the top of the window. I closed my eyes, but in every corner of the room, behind every piece of furniture, there was an irresistible magnet pulling at my eyelids and lifting them up; so, although I didn't want to, I opened them. At the same moment a gust of wind shook the house, the wood creaked, a red man waving a sword stood out from the shaking tapestry, the crocodile began to dance at the end of its rope, opening its mouth, and monstrous shadows ran across the ceiling, while the warrior, awakened by the noise, shook in his armour. I wanted to scream, to stretch out my arms, to beg the warrior to defend me against the red man, but I couldn't utter a sound or make a movement, and I felt myself dying.
When I came to, my uncle was shaking me by the arm and it was broad daylight. My first glance was at the red man; he had returned to the motionless tapestry.
- You'll have to wake up alone and earlier than this every day," said my uncle; "now hurry up so I can get you working before I go out.
My uncle had that restless activity which is only to be found in people of small stature, and although he had received the same dose of energy as all the Kalbris, as in his case this energy only had to set in motion a microscopic body, it was raging. He got up every day at four o'clock, went down to his study and worked furiously until the clients arrived, that is until eight or nine o'clock. It was this four or five hours' work that I had to copy during the day, because bailiffs' deeds are done in duplicate, an original and a copy.
As soon as my uncle had left, I gave up the task he had given me, because since I had woken up, I had only one preoccupation, the red man in the tapestry; I felt that if next night he came off the wall again, I would die of it altogether: and when I thought of his threatening face and his raised sword, sweat stained my forehead.
When I had what I wanted, which wasn't very difficult, because my uncle had no recourse to anyone to put a part in a piece of furniture that arrived in a bad state, I went back up to my room. I went straight to the red man; he had taken on the most inoffensive air in the world, and was standing perfectly still in the middle of the tapestry. The warrior tried to shake himself out of his armour, but the sun was shining and it was ghost time. I gave him a good blow with the hammer on his armour, and with a gesture I made the crocodile understand that he had better behave if he didn't want to be executed too.
That done, and my conscience all the calmer for having resisted the desire for revenge that drove me to hammer a nail into the neck of the man with the sword, I went back down to the study and finished my work in time for my uncle's return.
He was kind enough to show his satisfaction and tell me that, whenever I finished my work, I could have fun dusting the furniture and scrubbing the old oak ones with a brush and a woollen cloth.
What a change between this new life and the happy one I had with Mr de Bihorel!
However, I adapted fairly well to the fourteen hours a day of continuous work that was imposed on me, but I could not get used to my uncle's diet at all. The pie of bread locked in the cupboard was no accident, it was the rule, and at every meal I had to make do with the slice I found on the table.
On the fourth or fifth day, driven by hunger, I grew bolder and, just as the cupboard was closing, I stretched out my hand; my gesture was so eloquent that my uncle understood.
- You'd like a second slice," he said, continuing to close the lock, "you did well to speak up. From this evening onwards, I'll give you a pie especially for you, which will belong to you; the day you're really hungry, you can have as much as you like.
I wanted to kiss him, but he continued:
- The only thing is, you'll manage to eat less the next day, so that your pie will last you a week. There's nothing as deceptive as appetite, and it's at your age that your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Thirty-eight decagrams a day is about the amount they give in hospices; that will be your portion, it's enough for men, it must be enough for you too, or else you'd be a glutton, which I couldn't bear.
No sooner was I alone than I looked up in the dictionary what a decagram was: ten grams, or two large ones, forty-four grains. I couldn't make heads or tails of it.
I wanted to know for sure. Before leaving, my mother had given me a forty-cent coin. I went to the baker, who lived opposite, and asked him for thirty-eight decagrams of bread; after a long explanation, he weighed me three quarters of a pound.
One pound less a quarter a day was the thirty-eight decagrams so generously offered by my uncle. In ten minutes, even though not an hour had passed since breakfast, I had devoured the whole morsel. So by supper time I was less hungry.
- I knew," said my uncle, misunderstanding the discretion with which I had cut a piece from my pie, "that it would keep you. It's the same with everything, you see. What is one's own, one spares; what belongs to others, one squanders. When you start to have money, you'll see that you'll want to keep it.
I had thirty-five pennies, but I didn't keep them for long; in a fortnight they were spent on paying me an extra twenty-five decagrams of bread a day.
My regularity in going to fetch this extra bread as soon as my uncle was out had made my acquaintance with the baker.
- My man and I don't know how to write," she said to me on the very day my money was running out, "and every Saturday we have to give a written note to one of our practices; if you want to do it for us, I'll pay you for your work with two stale cakes that you can choose from on Monday morning.
You can see how eagerly I accepted. But how much I would have preferred a good pound of bread to the two cakes! However, I never dared say so, because the baker, although she did not supply my uncle - who brought our bread from the country because he found it a penny cheaper - seemed to know him well, and I was ashamed for him to admit my hunger to someone who was only too willing to despise him.
How could this portion of bread, which is enough for a man, not be enough for me? It's because usually in hospices and prisons they add broth, meat and vegetables, whereas for us it was our main food, the rest being reduced to impossible dishes, the most fortifying of which was a herring, which invariably made up our lunch; when my uncle was there, we shared it in twos, which doesn't quite mean in halves; when he was on tour, I was ordered to keep half for the next day.
Incidentally, what I suffered from hunger at that time, one fact among twenty will make you understand.
Behind our house was a small courtyard, separated by a hedge from the neighbouring property. This property was inhabited by a Mr Buhour, who, having neither wife nor children, had a passion for animals. Among these animals, the one that held the first place in his master's affection was a magnificent Pyrenean dog, with white hair and a pink nose, called Pataud. As it was bad for Pataud's health to live in the flats, we built him a beautiful rustic house that backed onto our dividing hedge; and as it was also bad for his health for him to eat at table with his master, because this aroused his greed, which, if satisfied with meat and sweets, could give him a skin disease, we served him a beautiful porcelain bowl full of milk soup twice a day in his house. Like all dogs at rest, Pataud had a lazy or at least capricious appetite, and more often than not, if he ate lunch, he didn't eat dinner, or if he ate dinner, he wasn't on time for lunch, so the terrine often remained untouched. Through the hedge, when I went into the courtyard, I could see the pieces of white bread swimming in the milk and Pataud sleeping next to them. There was a hole in this hedge, and Pataud often used it to come into our yard; as he had a fair reputation for ferocity, my uncle put up with him without complaint: he was a guard who was as good as the strongest locks and who had the advantage of costing nothing. Despite this ferocity, we soon became the best of friends, and when I came into the courtyard, he would immediately come and play with me. One day, when he had taken my cap into his kennel and didn't want to bring it back, I was so bold as to go and get it and go through his hole. The terrine was in its usual place, full to the brim with creamy milk. It was a Saturday evening; from my pie, which I hadn't been careful enough with all week, I hadn't had a crouton bigger than an apple left for my dinner; I was so hungry my stomach was twisting; I threw myself on my knees and drank from the terrine, while Pataud looked at me, wagging his tail. He was my only friend, my only comrade during those hard times; with his beautiful pink muzzle, he would come and lick me when I sneaked in at night to take my share of his supper; every now and then he would stretch out a caressing paw, and with his big wet eyes he would look at me; a strange understanding had been established between us: he was certainly aware of his protection and he was certainly also happy about it.
What is life all about? If Pataud had always stayed with me, I probably wouldn't have embarked on the adventures I'm about to recount; but the season came when his master was accustomed to settling in the countryside. He took him with him, and I found myself alone, with only the company of my uncle, who did little to cheer me up, and my regular portion, which did little to fill my stomach.
These were sad days; I often had long unoccupied hours and, alone in this sombre study, I thought about my mother's house. I would have liked to write to my poor mother, but a letter from Dol to Port-Dieu cost six sous, and as I knew that she earned only ten sous a day, I didn't dare post all the letters I wrote. We were reduced to kissing through a fishmonger who came on market days.
The extra food I had found at Pataud's had, in recent times, made me rather indifferent to the smallness of my regular portion; when I only had it, it seemed to me that there were days when it was even smaller than usual. While my uncle's pie was under lock and key, mine was in a cupboard that didn't lock, but since no one ever came into the house, that didn't seem to matter to me. After a few days of observation, I had to admit that I was wrong: just as my uncle was cutting a slice of my bread, I opened the door behind which I was hidden.
Indignation gave me a courage I didn't think myself capable of.
- But, uncle, that's my pie!
- You don't think it's for me," he said calmly, "it's for the white cat; she has kittens and you wouldn't want to let her starve to death, would you? You have to be kind to animals, never forget that.
I had no affection for my uncle; from then on I despised and loathed him: a hypocrite, a thief, a coward and a villain, I was humiliated to be his nephew.
Deep down, he was, above all, a miser, greedy for gain, lavish with his trouble, indifferent to hardship, sensitive to money alone, worried and unhappy about what he would have to spend the next day, inconsolable about what he had spent the day before.
Today the memory of his avarice makes me laugh, but at the time I felt that youthful indignation which makes us take the tragic side of the same things that, later on, we are quite prepared to take the comic side.
He was, as you may imagine, the most unconcerned man in the world about his grooming; so I was very surprised to see him one morning making faces at himself in front of a large mirror in the hallway; he put his hat on his head, looked at himself, took it off, then, after brushing it off, put it back on and looked at himself again. The strange thing was that he brushed the top of the hat the right way round and the bottom against the grain, so that one half was smooth and the other bristly. I thought he was going mad, because he usually took such great care of this hat that, when it was hot, he only put it on his head after wrapping a strip of old paper around his hair to soak up the sweat: So, when he took off his hat to salute, it made him an extremely droll crown that provoked irresistible laughter even from those who knew him, i.e. feared him. 
- Come here," he said, seeing that I was following him with my eyes, "and take a good look at me; what do you think of my hat?
I thought all sorts of things about it, but now was not the time to tell him:
- I think it's well preserved.
- That's not what I'm asking you. Does it look like it's in mourning, and does the bristly part look like a pancake? Our brother Jérôme, from Cancale, has just died, and I have to go to the funeral; it's enough to pay for the journey without having to pay for a crepe, which would only serve me once, because I'm not going to be stupid enough to mourn a clumsy man who leaves nothing but debts.
Never was a burst of laughter so abruptly stopped as mine. I didn't know the uncle who had just died, I only knew that he had always been unhappy, that he was a year older than my uncle Simon, and that they had been comrades until the necessities of life separated them. I went back to my work in a daze; my ideas about the family had been singularly affected: what was brotherly friendship? what was respect for the dead?
Moreover, these ideas were not the only ones to be shaken by this daily contact, not by direct lessons, for my uncle hardly bothered to give me any, either good or bad, but by example and by what I saw at every moment.
Bailiffs in the country are the confidants or witnesses of all kinds of misery: my uncle added to this profession that of banker, or even, not to weaken the truth, that of usurer, and the collection of wretches and crooks who passed through his office was singularly complete. We worked at the same table, opposite each other; I was thus present at all his discussions with his clients, and it had to be very serious business for him to send me away on an errand. I never saw him give in to a prayer or delay or abandon a lawsuit; to tears, to pleas, to the most touching reasons, he remained as indifferent as if he had been deaf. Then, when he began to get bored, he pulled out his watch and put it on his desk.
- I can't afford to waste my time any more than my client can afford to waste his money," he would say. "If you still have something to say, I'm at your disposal, only I warn you that it's four francs an hour. It's fifteen minutes past twelve, come on.
The poor women who wept and begged, the men I saw crawling on their knees asking for time to pay, a month, eight days, a few hours, it would take too long to tell you, and what I am telling you is only to make you understand the feelings I had for my uncle. But if I could feel all the pitiless hardness in him, and sympathise with the fate of his victims, fortunately because of my age I was completely incapable of understanding the skill, dexterity and cunning, to put it mildly, that he brought to business.
He had bought an old stately home which he was remodelling from top to bottom to make it look good, and every Saturday we always had workmen and contractors coming to get paid.
One Saturday, I saw the master builder arrive: he seemed surprised to find me alone, because my uncle, he told me, had given him an appointment to settle his account.
He sat down and waited.
An hour, two hours, four hours passed and my uncle never arrived. And the master builder didn't leave. Finally, at eight o'clock in the evening, he arrived.
- Well," he said, "it's you, Maître Rafarin. I'm very angry; but business is business, you know.
My uncle had a way of doing things that I have since seen used by some business people who want to make themselves look important and who simply make fools of themselves. Instead of answering Rafarin, he asked me about what had happened during the day, read the letters that had arrived, went through the court documents, looked at what I had done, then, when he had given this inspection a good half hour, finally turning to the master mason who was still waiting:
- Well, my dear, what do you want?
- You promised to settle my account.
- That's true, but I'm very angry because I don't have any money.
- Tomorrow is my payday, and I also have a thousand-franc note to pay to your colleague, who is suing me. You've been promising me for six months; today I was counting on your word.
- My word! What word?" interrupted my uncle. Did I say: I give you my word of honour to pay you on Saturday? Didn't I? Then the word you're invoking was just an empty promise: come on Saturday, I'll pay you. You see, Maître Rafarin, there are promises and promises; you mustn't forget that.
- I didn't know; excuse me, I'm just a poor man; when I said: I'll pay on Saturday, I pay.
- What if you can't?
- When I've promised, I can, and that's why I'm tormenting you; your colleague has my word; if I break it, he'll sue me.
Rafarin then began to explain his position: he had made commitments, counting on those of my uncle; if he didn't pay the next day, the bailiff would come and seize him on Monday; his wife was dying, it would kill her. My uncle's answer to everything was simply:
- No money, my dear, no money; you don't want me to steal any to give to you; if you sue me, it's a lawsuit, and then you won't be paid for a year.
Four or five days earlier, when the other bailiff was talking to my uncle, I had heard him recommend to his colleague that things should be taken to the last extremity; without guessing the whole truth, which I did not understand until later, and which was that my uncle was the real creditor, this seemed strange to me: it seemed to me that I should, at the risk of being disagreeable to my uncle, serve the poor bricklayer; I therefore resolved to intervene whatever the cost. Just as my uncle was repeating for the tenth time: "If I had any money, I'd give it to you," I said aloud:
- I've had money.
I had hardly finished the last word when I received such a violent kick over the table that I toppled over my chair and fell forward, my nose on the desk.
- What's the matter, Romain?" said my uncle, rising to his feet.
He came over to me and pinched my arm until it bled:
- What a clumsy little fool!" he said, turning to Rafarin.
The latter, who had not seen the kick and had not felt the pinch, looked at us astonished; but believing that my uncle was looking for a feint to divert the conversation, he returned to the subject that was tormenting him.
- Since you have the money..." he said.
My exasperation was at its height.
- Here it is," I said, pulling the banknotes from the drawer where they were locked.
They both stretched out their hands at the same time, but my uncle was quicker and grabbed the bundle.
- Listen, Rafarin," he said after a moment's silence, "I want to do everything I can for you, and prove to you that my feelings of loyalty and generosity are not being talked about in vain, as some people claim. Here are three thousand francs that I wasn't supposed to receive until tomorrow, to be used immediately to pay a sacred debt that could disgrace me if I don't pay it, and I won't pay it, because by tomorrow I won't be able to find the money. But I will give it to you. Here, pay me, for the balance, your memory, and they are yours.
I thought Rafarin was going to jump on my uncle's neck, who, it turned out, wasn't as bad as you might think.
- My brief!" he exclaimed; "but it's more than four thousand francs.
- And so it is!
- And it was you who reduced it to that figure by cutting me out of everything. Ah, Mr Kalbris!
- You don't want these three thousand francs? My thanks, my dear, they'll do me a favour: what I did with them was to oblige you.
Rafarin repeated his explanations and his pleas; then finally, seeing my uncle's impassivity, he took the bill and paid it:
- The tickets!" he said in a deaf voice.
- Here," replied my uncle.
Then the master mason got up and put his hat on his head:
- Mr Kalbris," he said, "I'd rather be poor like me than rich like you.
My uncle turned pale and I saw his lips quiver; but he recovered at once and in a voice that was almost laughing:
- A matter of taste," he said.
Then, still smiling, he led Rafarin to the door exactly as he would have done for a friend.
As soon as he had pushed the door over the master mason's back, the expression on his face changed, and before I could ask myself what was going to happen, I received a terrible blow that lifted me from my chair and threw me to the ground.
- Now it's just the two of us," he said. I'm sure you talked about that money, knowing full well what you were doing, you bad boy.
The blow had hurt me cruelly, but it hadn't dazed me; all I could think about was getting even.
- That's true," I said.
He wanted to lunge at me, but I had foreseen this new attack; I threw myself to the ground and, passing under the table, I put it between us.
Seeing that I was escaping from him, his fury was further exasperated, and he grabbed a large Code in-4° called a Paillet, and threw it at me so hard that I went rolling to the ground.
As I fell, my head hit an angle, I felt a general numbness and couldn't get up straight away.
I had to support myself on the wall; I was drenched in blood, and my uncle looked at me without making a move to help me.
- Go and wash up, you wretch," he said, "and remember what you've gained by meddling in my affairs; if you ever do it again, I'll kill you.
- I want to go away.
- Where to?
- To Mum's.
- I mean it! Well, you're not going, because you're mine for five years and I want to keep you. I want to go to Mummy's, Mummy's, Mummy's: you big ninny!
VII
For a long time I had been tormented by an idea that came back to me every time I was hungry or my uncle had shaken me too hard, in other words every day; it was to escape from Dol and go to Le Havre to sail. During the hours my uncle was away, I had often amused myself by tracing my route on a large map of Normandy that hung on the staircase; lacking a compass, I had made myself a wooden one, and I had measured the distances as M. de Bihorel had taught me to do. From Dol, passing through Pontorson, I would sleep in Avranches; from Avranches I would go to Villedieu, Villers-Bocage, Caen, Dozulé, Pont-l'Évêque, Honfleur. That was eight days' walk at the most; bread cost three sous a pound at the time; if I could raise twenty-four sous, just twenty sous, I was sure not to die of hunger on the way. But how could I raise this capital of twenty sous? I had always stopped at this impossibility.
Le Paillot got me over it. Locked up in my room, after having washed my head under the pump and having stopped the blood as best I could, I no longer saw the difficulties of my project. The blackberries were beginning to blacken in the ditches along the woods; there were eggs in the birds' nests; you sometimes find pennies lost in the dust, and then why shouldn't I be lucky enough to meet some teamster who would let me ride in his carriage and give me a piece of bread to pay me for driving his horses while he slept? It wasn't impossible, we'd seen it. Once at sea, bon voyage, I was a sailor; when I came back, I'd go to Port-Dieu, my mother would kiss me and I'd give her my pay. If we were shipwrecked, well, so much the better: a desert island, savages, a parrot! Oh Robinson!
I could no longer feel my head wound and I forgot that I hadn't had any dinner.
Every Sunday, at daybreak, my uncle went off to his new estate, from where he did not return until late in the evening, so that from the Saturday we were there until Monday morning, I was sure not to see him, and by running away immediately, I could get a thirty-six hour head start; only, to do that, I had to get out despite the locks and doors, and that was impossible. I therefore decided that I would jump from the first floor into the courtyard and go through Pataud's hole; once in Mr Buhour's garden, I could easily reach the fields.
It was in my bed that I discussed and settled my plan, waiting to execute it until my uncle was in bed and asleep.
Soon I heard him enter his room, then almost immediately leave it, and it seemed to me that he was climbing the stairs to the second floor, careful not to make any noise. Did he suspect my plan and want to observe me? He gently pushed open my door. With his nose turned towards the wall, I didn't see him enter, but I could see on the wall the trembling shadow of his hand, which he held in front of his candle to break its light. He walked slowly towards my bed.
I pretended to be fast asleep. I felt him lean over me, bring the light close to my head, and with his fingertips push aside the hair that hid my wound.
- Come on," he said half aloud, "it'll be nothing.
And he walked away as he had come.
Such a step, and such a sign of interest, might have changed my mind the day before; but it was too late: in my imagination I had smelt the scent of the sea and the tar, I had opened the mysterious doors of the unknown.
An hour after my uncle's departure, when I thought he was fast asleep, I got up and began my preparations; that is, I tied two shirts and some stockings in a handkerchief. I hesitated for a moment whether I would put on my first communion clothes, which I thought would do me honour; fortunately, a glimmer of common sense prevailed and I decided on a good jacket and trousers made of thick sailor's cloth; then, with my shoes in my hands so as not to make a noise, I left my room.
No sooner had the door closed than a crazy idea occurred to me. I went inside. Although there was no moonlight, the night was not dark, and my eyes, accustomed to the dark, could make out objects. I balanced a chair as best I could on my bed and, by climbing on it, I was able to reach the crocodile hanging from the ceiling; with my knife I cut the rope holding it, lowered it into my arms, laid it full length in my bed and pulled the sheet over its head.
Imagining what my uncle would look like on Monday morning when he found the crocodile in my place, I laughed like a maniac, and I laughed some more when it occurred to me that he might think I'd been eaten.
This joke was my revenge.
It's amazing how four walls and a roof over your head give you confidence; when I found myself in Mr Buhour's garden after having fortunately tumbled out of the window by clinging to the wall, I didn't feel like laughing at all. I looked around anxiously: the shrubs in the night were taking on strange shapes; between the clumps of trees there were big black holes that I would have liked to avert my eyes from; a light breeze passed through the branches, and the leaves rustled with moans; without knowing what I was doing, I threw myself into Pataud's niche. Poor Pataud! If he had been there, I might not have left.
I'd always thought I was brave, but when I realised I was missing my legs and my teeth were chattering, I felt ashamed. But I fought back this emotion; if I was already scared, I should have gone back to my uncle. I got out of the kennel and walked straight to a tree which, with its arms outstretched, seemed to be saying to me: "You shall go no further"; it didn't move, only the birds that were sleeping in its foliage flew away screaming. I was frightening the others, and that gave me courage.
I threw my bundle over the wall that separated the garden from the countryside and, using the trellis, climbed onto the hood. As far as my eyes could see, I looked across the plain; it was deserted, no sound could be heard, so I let myself slide.
I ran for over an hour without stopping, because I knew that if I took the time to look around, I would die of fear. At the end, I couldn't breathe; I was in the middle of the meadows crossed by the dyke that carries the water from the marshes to the sea; it was haying season, and through a white vapour I could see the mules that lined the path. Without slowing my pace, I abandoned the main road and, descending into the meadow, huddled under the hay. I was sure I was more than two leagues from the city; I thought I was at the end of the world: I could breathe.
Shattered by my emotions, dizzy from my wound, weakened by hunger, tiredness made me lie down on the hay, which had retained the warmth of the sun, and I fell asleep, lulled by the croaking of thousands of frogs, which were making a deafening noise in the marsh ditches.
The stars faded; great white stripes cut the bluish depths of the night, and a vaporous fog hung over the meadow, swirling like columns of smoke. My clothes were as wet as if they had caught a shower, and I shivered all over my body, for if the hay had given me its warmth on one side, the dew had soaked me with its coolness on the other.
But more painful than this chill was a vague feeling of unease. In the evening, the melancholy sadness of the heart; in the morning, the worries and anxieties of the conscience, which, while the body sleeps, wakes up and speaks. The shipwreck and the desert island no longer seemed as pleasant as the day before. I would never see my mother again! My eyes filled with tears and, despite the cold, I remained motionless, sitting on the hay with my head in my hands.
When I picked her up, my plans had changed: I would go straight to Port-Dieu, and I wouldn't leave for Le Havre until I had seen my mother again. If I arrived in the evening, I could hide in the deckhouse and leave in the morning without anyone suspecting that I had come. At least I'd take that memory with me, and if it was a mistake to abandon it like that, it seemed to me that it would be less serious.
I picked up my pack again. I had at least twelve leagues to go, there was no point in wasting time; it would soon be daylight and already in the distance I could hear birds calling.
It did me good to walk; I felt less sad, less weighed down: the pink tinge that was rising in the sky towards the East was also rising in me, and, for my ideas as for everything around me, the monstrous exaggerations of the shadow were dissipated under the light.
The fog that floated in the atmosphere gathered over the great ditch of the dyke, leaving only a few old willow pollards tearing at its cottony waves. A light breeze passed through the trees, shaking off the dew of the night; the grasses and flowers straightened up; a transparent smoke rose lightly and quickly; it was daytime. With M. de Bihorel, I had often seen the sun rise, I had never looked at it; but as if, by my emancipation, I had become one of the masters of the earth, I deigned to take pleasure in this spectacle.
This master, however, soon found that, if nature was kind to his eyes, she had little for his stomach: flowers everywhere, fruit nowhere; perhaps I had been wrong to rely on chance to feed me.
After walking for several hours, this concern became a certainty. In the fields, there was nothing, absolutely nothing that could be eaten; on the contrary, in the villages I passed through, preparations were being made for Sunday; on the tables of the inns, quarters of meat, in the bakers' shops, large loaves of bread, golden cakes that still exhaled the good smell of hot butter. When I looked at them, my mouth filled with water and my stomach churned.
When an unfortunate creditor complained to my uncle that he was dying of hunger, he never failed to reply: "Tighten your belly". I was naïve enough to try this method, but it is probable that those who so generously suggest it have never used it, because, with the buckle of my waistcoat well strapped, I breathed with difficulty, I was much hotter, and I was no less hungry.
I thought that if I didn't keep thinking about this terrible hunger, I would suffer less, and I began to sing; the people passing along the road in their Sunday best looked with astonishment at this child who was walking slowly, his bundle in his hand, shouting at the top of his voice.
The songs didn't work for me for long, my throat dried up, and to hunger was added thirst: this need was easy to satisfy, I often enough cut small rivers that ran to the sea. I chose a clean spot, got down on my knees, stuck my chin in the water and drank as much as I could, thinking wrongly that as long as my stomach was full, liquid or solid, it didn't matter; I remembered that during a fever lasting four or five days I had gone without eating; I had only drunk and I hadn't been hungry.
A quarter of an hour later, I was drenched in sweat; it was the water working under the sun's rays. I became weary, my heart failed me and I struggled to find a tree to sit in the shade. I had never felt so weak; my ears were ringing, I could see things in red; I was very close to a village, though, and I could hear the bells ringing mass; but what help could this proximity to men be to me? I didn't have a penny to enter the baker's shop.
I had to walk; some peasants passing by on their way to mass had already looked at me while talking amongst themselves; and I was going to be arrested as a vagrant, I would have to say where I was going, where I came from; I would be taken back to my uncle. The thought terrified me.
As soon as rest and fresh air had restored my strength, I set off again; the stones were very hard, my legs very stiff, and the sun was devouring me.
I realised that if I wanted to walk as I had done since the morning, I would inevitably fall down exhausted without being able to get up again; I therefore resolved never to go more than half a mile without resting, and whenever my heart was in my throat, to sit down without persisting any further.
As I tramped along, three verses I had learnt at M. de Bihorel's house came back to me so stubbornly that they were both tiresome and annoying:
Did God ever leave his children in need?
He feeds the young birds,
And his goodness extends over all nature.
It seemed to me that, in God's eyes, I could be no less than the birds that fluttered from branch to branch with their joyful cries.
For a long time I had been mechanically repeating these verses, which were music to me, a sort of march rather than a hope, when I entered a wood, the first I had yet found. Suddenly my eyes were drawn to the yellow broom-covered bank by tiny red dots shining in the grass: strawberries, they were strawberries! I didn't feel my fatigue any more, and with a leap I crossed the ditch; the slope was laden with fruit as if it had been a garden bed; under the woods and in the clearings there were thousands of them forming a red carpet. I've eaten bigger and better ones since, never better: they were strength, joy and hope. You could definitely go to the ends of the earth:
Did God ever leave his children in need?
You can't pick wild strawberries quickly; you have to go here and there and bend down for each one. My hunger calmed, if not quenched, I wanted to stock up for the road. I thought that if I had enough, I might be able to exchange them for a piece of bread.
A piece of bread, that was my dream! But I was in a hurry; it was past midday, I still had five or six leagues to go before I reached Port-Dieu, and I could feel on my legs that they would be the longest and the slowest. So I wasn't able to fill my handkerchief with ash leaves as much as I would have liked, and I returned to the main road more ready and braver than when I had left it.
It wasn't long before I became weary, and instead of walking half a kilometre in one go, I took a rest every kilometre, sitting on the milestone itself. This weariness must have been visible, because while I was sitting on a hill, I was joined by a fishmonger who was walking in front of his horses. He stopped in front of me and looked at me.
- Now there's a young man who's tired, isn't he?
- A bit, sir.
- You can tell. Are you going far like this?
- Another five leagues.
- If it's towards Port-Dieu, I'll go there; and I can take you there.
The moment was decisive; I gathered up what strength and courage I had.
- I don't have any money," I said, "but if you want strawberries as payment, here are some I've just picked.
And I opened my handkerchief.
- Here, they smell nice. So, my boy, you haven't got a penny," he said, changing his tone and stopping treating me like a gentleman, "well, get in anyway; you look too tired; you'll sell your strawberries at the Beau-Moulin inn, and you'll pay me for the drop with the money from your deal.
They gave me six sous for my poor strawberries at the Auberge du Beau-Moulin, but only because my friend the fishmonger shouted loudly that it was a robbery to pay me less.
- Now," he said, when the deal was done, "two drops.
I wasn't in a position to be bashful.
- I'd rather have a piece of bread," I said, "if you like.
- Come on, drink as much as you like; if you're hungry, you can have your share of the bread in the round I'm paying for.
My share in bread! I didn't say it twice, please believe me.
Instead of arriving at Port-Dieu in the evening as I had thought, I got there before four o'clock, in other words at a time when, as my mother was at vespers, I could enter the house without anyone seeing me, and take all the time I needed to settle into the deckhouse where my mother hardly ever went. I found it just as I'd left it, as it had been since my father's death: full of his nets and fishing gear. Dried out like old cobwebs, they still had the smell of tannin and tar. I began by kissing the nets, then I took an armful and made myself a bed for the night. This arrangement completed, after positioning the skylight that opened onto the kitchen so that I could see without being seen, I waited.
I had counted on not being tired; as soon as I was seated, I fell asleep, and it was the sound of voices that woke me up, a long time later no doubt, since it was night. My mother was stooping over the fireplace, blowing on three bundles of firebrands. Next to her, one of my aunts was leaning against the wall.
- So," she said, "are you going on Sunday?
- Yes, I'm too bored, and then I want to see for myself what he's like; he doesn't complain in his letters, but it seems to me that he's sad.
- You can say what you like, but if I were you I wouldn't have given him to Brother Simon.
- Did you have to leave him at sea?
- Well, what's next?
- Where are our brothers Fortuné and Maxime? Where is my poor dear man? Where is Françoise's husband? Look around us at those who are missing. Oh! the sea!
- I'd be even less afraid of it than of Simon; he's not a man, he's a pile of money.
- The Leheu brothers were talking about him the other day; it seems he's rich to the tune of more than three hundred thousand francs; it's not honest to earn such a large fortune in his condition. Ah! if he hadn't taken Romain for five years!
- Do you have to let him have it all the same?
- If I take him away, he'll get angry; he'll want me to pay compensation; where will I get it? You don't know him. Anyway, I'll see the boy.
- Well, Saturday evening I'll bring you a jar of butter; you can give him that from me; he mustn't be too well fed.
With my aunt gone, my mother prepared supper. The smell of the potatoes frying in the pan reminded me of the old days, when I used to come home hungry from school!
She sat down at the table, and I saw her face to face, fully lit by the candle. Her meal wasn't long, and it was interspersed with moments of rest, during which she remained with her eyes lost in vagueness, as if she were waiting for someone to arrive, at other times fixing them with a sigh on the place I had once occupied opposite her. Poor dear Mum! I can still see her, with her kind face, so sad, but so sweet. It was me she was thinking about, me she was sighing after, and there I was, three steps away from her, held back, chained by my cursed resolution.
With her usual neatness and tidiness, she put everything back in its place, washed her plate, wiped the table, then, kneeling before the image of Saint Roman hanging on the wall, she began her prayer.
How many times, both of us in the same place at the same time, had we prayed this prayer together, asking God to stretch out his hand over my father!
Hearing these fervent words that we had repeated so often, I knelt down on the nets and softly repeated them. But this time it wasn't my father's name that came from my mother's emotional lips, it was mine.
Ah! how could I not have jumped close to her at that moment?
VIII
I fell asleep weeping; my sleep was less calm under my mother's roof than it had been the night before in the meadows of Dol.
Before dawn and as soon as I heard the sea pounding under the cliffs, I left the deckhouse carefully.
The day before, when I had arrived at four o'clock, the tide was beginning to go out, so the high tide told me that daylight would soon be coming, and I didn't want to be seen by any early-morning neighbours.
In my travel plan, I hadn't foreseen how difficult it would be to leave the house where I was born, because when I reached the gorse hedge that separates our courtyard from the moor, I stopped in spite of myself and turned round. My heart was pounding. The cock was crowing in our henhouse, and the neighbourhood dogs, awakened by the sound of my footsteps, were choking on their barks. I could hear their chains rattling with every jerk as they rushed to my side. Dawn was beginning to break and, in a narrow band of white light coming down from the top of the cliff, the house was outlined in black.
My childhood, from the day I first felt alive, came flooding back to me: the nights when, to stop me crying, my father would take me round the room singing:
The stones touch the earth,
Tire lire, lire...
the first seagull I'd been able to catch alive, which, its wing broken, would come and eat out of my hand; my mother's anxious awakenings on stormy nights when my father was away, and my prayers before the trembling candle. The worries and torments I had seen her suffer so much, she would suffer again after my departure: abandoning her, wasn't that a crime?
The lighthouse went out, and the sea appeared luminous under the still dark sky; above the chimneys of the village, columns of yellow smoke rose straight up into the air, and the sound of hooves echoing on the pebbles of the streets reached me; people were waking up.
However, on the crest of the embankment, crouched among the gorse, I remained hesitant, impatient, unhappy, dissatisfied with myself and desolate. The spirit of chance, the vague hope of making my fortune without being a burden to anyone, my nature, the dizzying unknown, pulled me towards the moor; habit, the timidity of my age, my trials of the day before, the thought of my mother above all, stiffened the ties that bound me to the house.
The angelus tinkled and the volley of prayers had not yet died down when my mother pushed open the door and stood on the threshold, ready to leave for the day. Was she going to work in the village or in the upper village, a hamlet on the plain inhabited exclusively by farmers? If she was going to work in the village, she would go down and away from me; if, on the other hand, she was going to work in the upper village, she would go up and walk along the embankment where I was hidden. I had a moment of anxiety, for I was quite shaken, quite irresolute. As fate would have it, she was working that day in the village, and I couldn't resist the temptation to throw myself into her arms.
When I heard the stile creak down, I stood up in the gorse to at least follow her with my eyes; I saw nothing but the whiteness of her bonnet appearing behind the hedge. The sun had risen above the cliffs and was now shining brightly on the house; under its rays, the moss that thatched the roof was velvety green, and here and there yellow tufts of sedum were blooming. The breeze was beginning to blow across the sea, and in the pure morning air it brought a salty freshness from the open sea that I am still breathing in as I tell you this story, and whose bitter taste I seem to find on my lips.
But I don't want to give in to these emotions that would willingly drag me away.
I left my mother's house as I had left Dol, that is to say running; and it was only when I ran out of breath that I slowed down.
Running is good for getting dizzy, but you can't think properly unless you're resting.
Now I needed to think; I had set off, that was good; now I had to arrive, that was the difficult part.
I sat down at the foot of a hedge: the plain was deserted, there was no danger of being surprised; only in the distance could I see, on the edge of the cliff, a customs officer on guard, outlined in black against the brightness of the rising sun.
The result of my reflections was that instead of following the main road, as I had first decided, I would follow the seashore. My experience of two days had taught me that the main roads are not very hospitable to those who do not have a well-stocked wallet, and my greatest concern was to ensure food during my journey. I was reminded of something M. de Bihorel had often said to me: "The sea is a better nurse for man than the land", and I was counting on its shores to provide me with the essentials: oysters and mussels. At the thought of oysters, I must admit that my appetite was awakened: it had been so long since I had eaten any! What a feast I was about to make!
I stood up. How many more leagues separated me from Le Havre by the shore? A lot, it seemed to me, but what did I care? A month's walk along the shore didn't frighten me.
However, I didn't dare go down straight away, for fear of meeting people from Port-Dieu who would have recognised me. It was only when I had gone three or four leagues along the top of the cliff that I dared to go down to the beach to look for my lunch.
I couldn't find any oysters, and had to make do with the mussels that covered the rocks. My hunger calmed a little, I should have continued on my way; but I was so happy to see the sea again that I amused myself by running on the sand and foraging in the holes: I was free to frolic and sing. What a difference from my imprisonment in Dol! Travelling was definitely more fun.
A plank of fir, which I found wedged between two blocks of granite, made me very happy. I made a boat of it; with my knife I gave it the shape of a ship; in the middle, advancing a little towards the point, I bored a hole; in the hole I pushed a stick of cedar, which I held straight with wicker sticks; Crossing this stick, I held out my handkerchief, and so I had a magnificent frigate, to which I gave my mother's name and which, throughout the low tide, with my trousers rolled up above my knees, I sailed on a large puddle. 
The evening surprised me in this occupation. I had to look for a place to stay for the night: I chose one in a small cave that the sea had dug under these cliffs during the spring tides, then I gathered a few armfuls of dried kelp and made myself a bed. It wasn't a palace, but it was better than the marshes of Dol. I was safe from the cold, safe from surprise above all, I had a good pillow that I had made myself from large pebbles; in front of me, the light of a lighthouse, serving as a nightlight, reassured me against loneliness; I fell asleep as peacefully as in a house, and travelled all night on my frigate in the land of dreams. After being shipwrecked on an island where six-pound loaves and chops hung from the branches of trees like apples from apple trees, I was appointed king by the savages; my mother joined me; she became queen; and when we drank good sweet cider, our subjects shouted: "The king drinks, the queen drinks!
It was hunger that woke me up before daybreak, a hunger that made my stomach churn and my heart grow cold. I had to wait for the tide to go out before picking up my supply of mussels: but the more I ate, the hungrier I got; my meal certainly lasted more than two hours, and I still stopped more tired of opening them than full. I began to think that a piece of bread with the mussels would be a very good thing. But how could I get bread?
Please don't conclude, because I'm always talking about bread, hunger and food, that I was a gourmand; I simply had a big appetite like children of my age, and the question of eating, which, in the conditions in which I found myself, was the most important question, became even more painful: Besides, those who think they know hunger from the pleasant sensations they feel when they sit down to dinner an hour late hardly know what it is; but those who, after long months of deprivation, have spent whole days with an empty stomach will understand the vividness of my memories. 
The place where I had spent the night would have produced oysters, and I might well have stayed there for a while longer, as I liked it a lot for the facilities it offered me for sailing my frigate; nobody had bothered me there, and then the cave, the lighthouse, all that kept me back, but hunger decided me to continue on my way; perhaps further on I would find something better than mussels.
I took down the mast of my ship, put the sail back in my pocket, and left my lodgings; as any good traveller should do, I gave them a name before leaving: "the King's cave".
As I made my way along the cliffs, the idea of a piece of bread came back to me in an awkward way, and there came a time when it was quite demanding: I had come across a river and had to cross it almost by swimming, that is to say with water up to my shoulders, and carrying my clothes on my head. This forced bath had made my stomach even worse; my legs were failing me and my vision was blurred.
It was in this state that I approached a village that stretched out like an amphitheatre on the edge of the sea; I decided to cross it, hoping not to meet anyone I knew. When I reached the square next to the church, I couldn't resist the temptation to stop in front of a baker's shop. He had large loaves of golden bread on display, and the smell of flour and galette wafted through the door. I was admiring the sight, wondering whether my eyes would not be strong enough to lift the loaves from the display and bring them to my mouth, when there was a great noise behind me in the square; a clatter of hooves, a confusion of shouts; children were coming out of school.
Was it because they didn't know me? Could it be because I looked strange? Which is very possible, because with my frigate under one arm, my parcel in my hand, my shoes dusty, my hair bristling under my cap, I must have looked like a strange little fellow, -- in any case, they surrounded me as soon as they saw me. The first to arrive called the latecomers, and I soon had a circle of children around me, examining me like a curious animal.
My frigate, or rather the piece of wood I gave that name to, seemed to astonish them. They wondered among themselves.
- Hey Joseph, what's that under his arm?
- Can't you see it's a plank?
- No, it's music.
- Music, silly! He hasn't got a woodchuck.
No groundhog? So they took me for a Savoyard. My pride was wounded.
- It's a frigate," I said with dignity; and at the same time I took a few steps to get out of the circle that had closed in.
- A frigate! -- How stupid! -- Look at that sailor!
I was stunned by all the shouting; everyone was laughing and dancing around me.
I wanted to pass through the crowd, but I felt a boy, the boldest of the bunch, pulling my frigate from behind me. At the same time, my cap was taken from me by another, and I soon saw it spinning in the air.
My cap, my beautiful party cap! I jostled those nearest me to run after it, grabbed it in the air and, thrusting it down on my head, I came back with my fist clenched, determined to take my revenge.
But at that moment a chime sounded in the bell tower, and all the children rushed to the porch, dragging me with them and shouting:
- Here comes the christening!
The godfather and godmother were coming out of the church; no sooner had they crossed the threshold, than the godfather, who was a handsome gentleman, rummaged through a large bag that a servant was carrying behind him, and threw us a handful of sugared almonds. There was an initial scramble among the children; but before they were up and about, the godfather began his distribution again. This time he hadn't just thrown sweets; on the pavement of the square you could hear big pennies bouncing and rolling. I saw one coming my way and jumped on it. While I was down, a new distribution took place, and I was lucky enough to catch a dime. Although it hadn't been on the ground very long, others had seen it; furious that it had escaped them, they rushed at me shouting:
- He's not from the country! It's not fair.
They stepped on my hands to make me let go; I squeezed harder. Fortunately the godfather hadn't emptied his bag, and the children left me to run after more handouts.
I had twelve sous; I went into the baker's and had a pound of bread cut for me; never has music sounded so sweet to me as the sound of the crust breaking under the knife; as I bit into my loaf, I hurried out of the village: my thoughts of revenge had vanished and all I wanted was to escape from my enemies.
I walked for about two hours to an old abandoned customs guardhouse, where I decided to spend the night.
I had often heard it said that riches take away sleep; this came true for me. With a few armfuls of dry clover I had made myself an excellent bed; I slept very badly there, tormented by the question of what I was going to do with my money. The pound of bread I had bought for supper had cost me three sous, so I still had nine sous of my fortune left. Should I live for three days on my little treasure, or would it not be better to use it to buy a few things that could provide me with food throughout my journey? These were the two questions that troubled me all night. If the day before I had had a vase in which to cook my catch, I would not have suffered from hunger; I would have eaten crabs, crabs and edible crabs; and if I had had a net only half the size of my handkerchief, I would have caught as many prawns in the puddles as I wanted.
Finally, in the morning, I decided that in the first village that came my way, I would buy a penny box of matches, some string for three pennies, and with the rest a tin pan to cook my catch. I must say, however, that what made me decide on this wise course of action was not so much wisdom as the desire for string. Decidedly, wicker was worthless for shrouding my frigate; with three pennies' worth of twine, I could rig it very well, and the surplus would be enough for a net.
So I started by buying the twine, then the matches; but the saucepan presented a difficulty I hadn't foreseen: the cheapest one cost fifteen sous. Fortunately, I spotted one in a corner, so dented that it had been thrown away as undeserving of repair. I asked if it was for sale, and the shopkeeper, out of kindness, she told me, agreed to give it to me for five sous.
I made even less headway that day than I had the day before, for as soon as I had found a suitable place, I spent my time making a needle and a wooden mould, and then a small net. I got used to this work as soon as I could move my fingers, so it was a game to me. For dinner, I had the pleasure of eating prawns caught with my net and cooked in seawater in my pan, on a bit of wood picked up here and there in the hedges.
But not all happiness comes at once: I had set up my kitchen on the beach, at the foot of a cliff, and the smoke rose above in little swirls. This attracted the attention of a customs officer; I saw him bend over the edge of the cliff to examine where this fire was coming from; then he went away without speaking to me; but in the evening, when I was looking for a hut to sleep in, I found him watching me, and it seemed to me that he was looking at me strangely. It seems that I was a real curiosity; and with my frigate on my back, my saucepan slung over my shoulder, cross-legged with my net, my pack in my hand, I could tell that I was not a person to be trusted. Many times before, when I passed through a village or met peasants, I had been observed, and if I hadn't been questioned, it was because I had forced my way through. If that customs officer was going to ask me what I was doing there, he was going to stop me. Fear gripped me; to escape him, instead of continuing along the seashore, I went inland along the first path I came across; his post was holding him back on the cliff, so I knew he wouldn't be able to follow me.
If I didn't have the customs officers to fear in the fields, on the other hand, I didn't have their huts to take shelter in; I had to sleep in the middle of the field; and what was most annoying was that I couldn't see a single clump of trees; in the distance only a few haystacks that made black spots on the purple sunset. It was a night to be spent as in the marshes of Dol. It wasn't as bad. Some pitchforks had been left in the field; I used them to make a sort of roof against a haystack; over and around them I piled a few bundles of alfalfa, and I was thus well sheltered from the cold in a sort of perfumed nest.
The fear of being caught there by the haymakers made me leave as soon as the freshness of the early morning and the cries of the birds woke me up. I was still terribly sleepy; my legs were sore too, but the main thing was not to get caught; I'd sleep during the day.
It was not my appetite, as you can well imagine, that determined the time of my meals, but the tide; I could only have lunch or dinner when it was low and I had fished: now, as it was full tide at around eight o'clock, I couldn't eat before noon, and even then I was forced to make do with crabs that I caught as soon as the sand began to open up a little. So as not to be exposed to a similar abstinence from now on, I resolved to always have provisions in advance and, when my meal was over, I set about catching prawns. I caught a large quantity of the species you call bouquet in Paris, as well as three fairly good plaice and a sole.
As I was heading back towards the cliff, looking for a place where I could cook my catch, I met a lady walking two little girls who was teaching them to look for shells in the sand with a wooden shovel.
- Well," she said, stopping me, "did you have a good catch, my boy?
She had beautiful white hair framing her face and big, soft eyes; her voice was almost caressing. It was the first word of interest I'd heard in four days: the little girls were blonde and very pretty; I wasn't afraid and didn't run away.
- Yes, ma'am," I said, stopping, and opened my net, in which my bunch of fish was swarming with a hoarse noise.
- Would you like to sell me your catch?
You'd be amazed at how my ears perked up at this proposal: twelve-pound loaves danced before my eyes, and I breathed in the smell of browned crust.
- How much do you want for it?
- Ten sous," I answered at random.
- The bouquet alone is worth at least forty; you don't know the price of your merchandise, my child. So you're not a fisherman?
- No, madame.
- Well, since you fish for your own pleasure, do me the kindness of accepting this forty-cent piece for this bouquet, and another for your fish, will you?
At the same time she handed me the two coins.
I was so taken aback by this magnificent offer that I couldn't think of anything to say.
- Come on, accept it," she said, helping me out of my embarrassment, "you can use it to buy whatever you like.
She put four francs in my hand, while one of the little girls poured my bouquet into her basket and the other took my fish strung on a string.
Four francs! No sooner had my practices turned their backs than I began to dance wildly on the sand. Four francs!
Barely a quarter of a league away were the houses of a village. I headed towards them, determined to buy a two-pound loaf of bread. I was no longer at all afraid of gendarmes, customs officers or country wardens; if I met one who asked me for something, I would show him my four francs:
- Let me through, you can see I'm rich!
I didn't meet any gendarmes or customs officers, but on the other hand I didn't meet any bakers either. I walked down the only street in the village twice: there was a café, a grocer, an inn, but no bread seller.
But I needed bread, and it wasn't by hearing my two coins ringing in my pocket that I could resign myself to going without. I was no longer as shy as I had been in previous days; the mistress of the inn was on her doorstep, and I dared to ask her where the baker lived.
- There isn't one here," she said.
- So, madam, would you sell me a pound of bread?
- We don't sell bread, but I can give you dinner if you're hungry.
Through the open door I could smell cabbage and hear the pot boiling on the fire. My hunger couldn't resist it.
- How much for dinner?
- For soup, bacon with cabbage and bread, thirty sous, including cider.
It was terribly expensive, but if she'd told me four francs I'd have gone in just the same. She put me in a small, low room and brought a loaf of bread to the table that weighed a good three pounds.
It was this loaf that lost me. The bacon was fatty; instead of eating it with a fork, I spread it on the bread and made sandwiches, the thickness of which I considered to be the main quality. The first piece was gobbled up, then a second, then a third. It was so good. The loaf had shrunk considerably. I cut a fourth piece, this one huge, telling myself it would be the last. But when it was finished, I still had a bit of bacon left: I went back to the loaf and in the end only left a very thin slice. After all, this was a unique opportunity, I had to make the most of it.
I thought I was alone in the room, but a confused noise, something like laughter and muffled chatter, made me turn my head towards the door; behind the glass, with the curtain raised, the innkeeper, her husband and a maid were looking at me, laughing.
They entered the room.
- Did the gentleman have a good dinner?" asked the innkeeper, and they started laughing again.
I was in a hurry to get away; I offered my forty-cent piece.
- It was thirty sous for a man," said the innkeeper; "for an ogre it's forty, my boy," and she didn't give me any change.
I had gone through the door when she called me back.
- Don't burst, will you? Don't walk too fast, it'll be safer.
Despite this recommendation, I ran like a thief, and it was only after a certain distance that I slowed down.
I was ashamed to have spent so much money on a single meal, but physically I felt very well; since I had been on the road, I had never felt so brave.
I had a good dinner and forty sous in my pocket: in short, the world was still mine.
I decided to abandon the seaside and take the route I had first mapped out for myself, through Calvados.
Only one difficulty stood in my way. Where was I? I had passed through many villages and two towns, but I didn't know their names; on a road I would have had the mileposts to help me, but there are no mileposts along the cliffs, and I didn't dare ask the names of the villages or towns. It seemed to me that as long as I seemed to know where I was going, they wouldn't tell me anything, whereas if I asked the way they would stop me. I remembered very well the layout of the département of La Manche, and I knew that, as it forms a point in the sea, since I didn't want to follow the coastline, I had to head east; but would the route I was going to take take me to Isigny or Vire? At Isigny I'd be back on the coast, in other words fishing; at Vire I'd be in the middle of the land, with no hope of being able to renew my food supplies as soon as my forty cents had been spent.
It was a very serious question and I could feel it.
After wavering for a long time, I decided to try the adventure, and the first road I found I took with my back to the sea; my hope was in the mileposts. It wasn't long before I spotted one; it read: "Quetteville: 3 kilometres". At the entrance to Quetteville, I found on the corner of a wall an inscription written in white letters on a blue background, reading: "Route départementale n° 9, de Quetteville à la Galainière, 5 kilomètres". As I had no recollection of seeing these two names on the map, I was left very confused. Where was I? I was lost!
I walked through the village, then when I was far enough away not to fear the curious, I sat down on the steps of a beautiful granite calvary, which stood there. It was built at the crossroads of four roads, at the highest point of a hillock, and all around it the view stretched out over vast wooded plains, in the middle of which rose here and there a stone bell tower; behind it, the white line of the sea, which merged with the sky. I had been walking since morning; the sun and the heat were the strongest; having leaned on a step to think more quietly, I fell asleep.
When I woke up, I felt two eyes fixed on mine; at the same time I heard a voice saying to me:
- Don't move.
Naturally I did not obey, and getting up, I looked around to see how I could save myself.
The voice, which at first was rather gentle, became impatient.
- Don't move, kid, you're doing well in the landscape; if you want to go back to your position, and if you keep it, I'll give you ten sous.
I sat down again; the man who spoke to me like that didn't seem to want to stop me. He was a tall young man wearing a soft felt hat and a grey velvet suit: he was sitting on a pile of stones with a cardboard box on his lap. I realised that he was drawing my portrait, or more precisely that of the site and the Calvary, as he had said that I looked good in the landscape.
- You don't have to close your eyes," he said, when I had resumed my position, "nor your mouth; what do you call this place?
- I don't really know.
- So you're not from the country? You're not a potter though, are you?
I couldn't help laughing.
- Will you please not laugh! If you're not a tinker, what are those pots and pans you're carrying on your back?
The questions were already starting, but this gentleman seemed to be the best man in the world, and I felt drawn to him, so I wasn't afraid to answer. I told him the truth: I was on my way to Le Havre; I used this pan to cook my catch; I'd been on the road for eight days; I had forty sous in my pocket.
- And you're not afraid of being murdered if you tell me you're carrying such a sum on you; you're a tough guy. Don't you believe in robbers?
I started laughing again.
As he drew, he continued to question me and, gradually, I came to tell him how I had lived since I'd been away.
- Well, my boy, you can boast of being a curiosity; you started off by making a fool of yourself, it's true, but in the end you got away with it. I like boys like you. Would you like to be my friend? Here's what I propose: I'm going to Le Havre too, but not in a hurry; I may not be there for a month, depending on the countries I pass through: if I like them, I'll stop to work; if they don't appeal to me, I'll pass them by. Do you want to come with me? You can carry my bag, which is over there, and I'll give you food and lodging.
The next day, I told him my story as you have just heard it.
- What a rough fellow your uncle is! he said, when I had finished telling him. Do you want us to go to Dol? You show him to me, and I'll charge him on all the town walls. I'll write above it: "Simon Kalbris, who let his nephew starve to death". A fortnight later, he will be forced to leave the city. No, you don't want that; you'd rather not see him again; you're merciful, you're right! But there's something in your story that I'm not indifferent to. You want to be a sailor, that's fine; it seems to be your vocation, that's fine too, and it's not for me to give you a speech about it, although, in my opinion, it's a bloody job; dangers, fatigue and nothing more. You're attracted by the heroic and adventurous side of things, fine again, if that's your idea. You do what you want, and although you're very young, you may even have the right to do so after the life you've had with your uncle. But there's one right you don't have, and that's to upset your mother. In the eight days since your uncle had to tell her about your flight, do you know what sorrows and anguish she has gone through? She thinks you're dead, no doubt. So you're going to take what you need to write from my bag, and while I'm making a sketch of this windmill, you'll write to your mother everything you've just told me: how you left your uncle, and why, and everything you've done since you left. You will also write that by chance - yes, you can write a happy chance - you met a painter called Lucien Hardel, who will take you to Le Havre and recommend you to a friend of his who is a shipowner, so that you can be taken on board a ship making a good crossing. When you've finished your letter, you'll see how much lighter your heart will feel.
Mr Lucien Hardel was right. I wrote a letter to my mother which I covered in tears, but once it was done, I felt more at peace with my conscience.
Those were the best days of my travels, the ones I spent with Lucien Hardel.
We'd walk straight ahead without a set itinerary, sometimes stopping for a whole day in front of a tree or a site he'd drawn, sometimes walking for a whole day without stopping. I carried his travelling bag, which wasn't very heavy and fitted over my back like a soldier's rucksack; he often took it from me on the way and wanted to carry it himself so that I could rest. Every morning I was in charge of buying the provisions: bread, hard-boiled eggs, a piece of ham, and having a flask filled with brandy which we mixed with the water. We had lunch on the main road at the foot of a tree, where it was; and, in the evening, we sighed in an inn. It was no longer a meal of prawns and crabs, but good hot soups: it was no longer hay for mattresses, but good white sheets, in which we lay undressed.
He was surprised not to find in me a complete peasant; what I had learnt from M. de Bihorel often surprised him: I knew more than he did about trees, the names of insects and grasses, and the world of the infinitely small, which very few people know. We didn't go long without talking: he had a good grace, a liveliness that made you feel at ease, a cheerfulness that was contagious.
Going straight ahead at random, we reached the outskirts of Mortain; it was hardly the direction of Le Havre, but I didn't care:* * certain of arriving there and being able to embark on one of the many liners that make the trips to Brazil, I didn't care whether I saved time or lost it.
The Mortain region is undoubtedly the most picturesque canton in Normandy. Fir woods, rocky outcrops, steep hills, dark gorges, foamy waters running under the trees or falling in waterfalls, and greenery of marvellous intensity and freshness make it a favourite haunt of painters, who find subjects for study and ready-made pictures at every turn.
Without settling anywhere, we circled a circle with Mortain at its centre, stretching as far as Domfront, Sourdeval, Saint-Hilaire-du-Harlouet and Le Teilleul. While Lucien Hardel worked, I fished for trout or caught crayfish in the holes for our supper.
I was too happy, it couldn't last, otherwise what should have been atonement would have been reward.
One morning, as we were going about our business, we saw a policeman coming towards us. From a distance he looked rather grotesque, and had certainly not been enlisted for the elegance or dignity of his stature.
Lucien Hardel was very sensitive to anything in people or things that lent itself to a charge, so he told me to look at him; at the same time, on the margin of the study he was working on, he sketched the gendarme's head in broad strokes.
The gendarme had come closer, and when he saw that we were examining him, he pulled his hat over his tawny hair, drew his sabre and slowed his pace, waddling nobly.
The pencil on the paper had followed his movements, and the result was a caricature that made me laugh out loud.
This did not please the gendarme, who came towards us:
- Sorry, excuse me," he said, "you've stared at me long enough; consequently I'd like to see your description.
- Well, Constable," said Lucien Hardel, placing the drawing in his box, "don't be embarrassed; I've looked at you; when you've looked back at me, we'll be even.
- It's my duty and my function to ask you for it, since you're wandering the high road.
Without answering the policeman, Lucien Hardel turned to me and said:
- Romain, take my passport from the bag: it's there, in the tobacco compartment, and present it politely to the gentleman.
Then, turning to the policeman, he said:
- I would like, out of respect for your duties, to present it to you on a silver plate; but on a journey, you know, you don't get what you want; that's precisely why Romain doesn't have any gloves; but as you don't have any either, once again we'll be even.
The gendarme realised that this polite speech, which he had at first listened to with a sort of bliss, was a mockery; he blushed, bit his lips, pushed his hat down on his head, then, to give himself a countenance, he began to read:
"We, etc., invite the civil and military authorities to allow the free passage of Mr.... Har... Hardel, Lu... Luci... Lucien, profession of... of... of..."
Here he remained embarrassed for a long time, then suddenly, as if gathering his courage:
- ... profession of... of pei... peitre passagiste.
Then he murmured a few more words between his lips, and handed me the passport:
- That's good!" he said majestically.
As he was about to turn his back on us, no doubt anxious to put an end to a conversation that was bothering him, Lucien Hardel, misguided, stopped him:
- Excuse me, sir, but you've gone over the main thing in my passport, the only thing for which I paid two francs, without a murmur.
- Like what?
- Like you owe me help and protection.
- Well, sir?
- Well, would you let me know in what capacity I am allowed to roam the high road?
- In the capacity stated in your passport.
- So, in the capacity of... a mere passenger.
- No doubt, since that's your profession.
- Please, again, could you tell me what is allowed and what is forbidden in my profession?
- Is it my job to teach you your trade?
- My job, no, but that of peitre passagiste; let's see, understand me well: for the gendarmerie, I'm a peitre passagiste? am I not? am I?
- Yes.
- Well, two leagues from here I meet one of your colleagues, he asks me for my passport; precisely because I'm doing something that doesn't fit in with my profession as a passenger driver, he arrests me.
- Consequently.
- So I have to know what I'm allowed to do and what I'm not allowed to do.
Big beads of sweat ran down the poor gendarme's red face; he could see he was being laughed at, and he was beginning to think he must have said something foolish. In the end his anger got the better of him:
- Are you going to molest the authorities like that for long, you, with your big beard? Since your profession is not your profession, it's not clear, and since it's not clear, I'm arresting you; follow me to the mayor's, you'll explain yourself to him. And that one," he pointed at me, "who's not on the passport, we'll see who he is. Do as you're told.
- So you're arresting me as a mere passenger?
- I'm arresting you because I'm arresting you; do I owe you a reason? Come on, comply or I'll arrest you.
- Well, let's get on with it; if the mayor is anything like you, the day will be complete; come on, Romain, and take the bag. Gendarme!
- What's the matter?
- Tie my hands and draw your sabre; since I'm paying for an arrest, I want it to be first class.
I was far from sharing this gaiety. I thought Lucien Hardel would have done better to keep his mouth shut. "We'll see who he is," said the gendarme. said the gendarme. This word was ringing in my ears. They were going to look, find out, and certainly send me back to my uncle.
Lucien Hardel walked along singing:
The poor prisoner
Whom they were taking to hang...
The gendarme followed him at arm's length and I followed at four or five paces. Half a league or so separated us from the village, and before reaching it we had to cross a wood. As luck would have it, the road was straight and at that moment we saw no one coming. No sooner had we advanced a hundred yards into the wood than, giving in to the sudden inspiration of my fears, my mind was made up. Better to expose myself to everything, I thought, than to be recognised and taken to Dol. I hadn't fastened the bag over my shoulders, I was carrying it in my hand, I slowed my pace imperceptibly, then throwing the bag to the ground, I leapt across the ditch.
At the sound of the bag falling, the gendarme turned round; I was already in the wood.
- Stop!" he shouted.
- Don't be afraid," said Lucien Hardel, "we'll have a few laughs.
All I said was, "Uncle," and "Goodbye!
And I threw myself through the trees. Were they chasing me or not? I ran straight ahead without looking back, oblivious to the branches that whipped my face and the thorns that tore me. I was running so madly that I didn't realise there was a gap; suddenly I felt the earth beneath my feet fail, and I rolled to the bottom of a large hole; I lay there, not because I was hurt, but because I was under an inextricable thicket of weeds and brambles so thick that I couldn't see the sky. I was governed by the instinct of a wild beast being hunted by dogs: lying low to the ground, making myself as small as possible, not breathing, I listened. I heard nothing but the cries of the birds as they flew away in fright, and all around me the sand, loosened by my fall, flowing gently grain by grain as if from an immense hourglass.
After a few minutes, when I was quite sure that I wasn't being chased, I could think about my position.
Here's how I reasoned: Lucien Hardel was confined to the mayor's office, the gendarme was going to warn his comrades, and together they would immediately set out to find me. If I didn't want to be caught, I had to leave immediately and get a bit of a head start. It didn't even occur to me that everything could have been arranged at the mayor's office, that the painter could have been set free and we could have continued our journey to Le Havre as agreed. I was in a state where only extreme resolutions present themselves to the mind, because only they are in keeping with our exaltation. In order not to be caught by the gendarmes and taken back to Dol, I think I would have gone through the fire. No doubt in my heart I was asking Lucien Hardel to forgive me for abandoning him, but wasn't it his absurd charges that had made our separation necessary?
IX
Two hours later, I reached the first houses of Sourdeval; but for fear of being noticed, I did not cross the town, I turned towards the back, so as to join the road to Vire.
The walk had calmed my exaltation, but I wasn't reassured about the difficulties of my journey to Honfleur: I no longer had my saucepan, my small pack had remained in Mortain, and in the middle of the countryside I was going to find myself in the same position as on the first day of my escape: I wasn't hungry yet, because I'd had a good breakfast, but it wouldn't be long before I was!
Add to that the fact that I saw gendarmes everywhere, and you'll understand that I wasn't having a very happy ride: first of all I missed my companion; then any hat, even any cotton bonnet that appeared in the distance was immediately changed into a tricorne by my worried imagination. I had not gone three leagues when, more than ten times already, I had left the main road to huddle in the corn or under the brambles of the ditch. As I was jumping over one of these ditches, I thought I heard a clear noise in my pocket, as if pennies were being struck: I searched myself; they were indeed pennies, there were six of them, and, what was even better, two forty-cent coins were attached to them: the day before I had bought some tobacco for my painter, and it was the change I had been given for five francs. Should I keep it? But how could I give it back? I promised myself I wouldn't fail to do so if I ever had the chance.
However great my fortune, I didn't let it dizzy me. After a few moments of reflection and advice to myself, I decided on the following plan: I would continue my journey on foot, I would sleep in the fields or in the woods, but I would not economise on my food. I was in a position not to deny myself the necessities of life.
It wasn't yet dark when I crossed Vire, but I got lost in the streets: instead of taking the road to Villers-Bocage, I took the road to Condé-sur-Noireau, and it was only when I reached Chênedollé that I recognised my mistake. I had studied my map enough to carry it in my head, and I knew that via Harcourt I could reach Caen; so I didn't bother with this diversions and slept perfectly well in the shelter of a rapeseed millstone. Two or three hundred paces from my lodgings, I could see a shepherd's hut in the middle of a sheep pen, whose warm, sweet smell the breeze brought to me; it was a security for me not to be alone in these great wooded plains, and to hear the dogs chained around the pen barking at me from time to time.
Lucien Hardel had told me many times, when I told him about my journey along the sea, that he considered it a miracle that I had escaped the fevers caused by the morning cold; so as soon as I felt myself awake with a shiver under my rape branches, I got up. It was not yet daylight, but already dawn was whitening the treetops. The eastern horizon was coloured yellow, above my head the stars twinkled faintly in the pale azure of the sky, while behind me stretched a great black canopy on which long snakes of grey vapour cut across the valleys. The dust on the paths was wet as if a light rain had fallen, and on the branches of the bushes, early morning birds were shaking off the night dew, ruffling their feathers.
I continued on my way for two days without anything particular happening to me; but you can imagine that I didn't walk like that from morning till evening without stopping. Towards midday and when I found a favourable spot, I slept for a few hours.
On the third day after passing Harcourt, I came to a large forest called the Forest of Cinglais, and the heat, although it was still morning, was so strong, so suffocating, that I couldn't wait until midday to take my nap. I had never been so hot, the road was burning my feet; I went deeper into the wood hoping to find a little coolness, but to no avail. In the thickest part of the thicket, as well as on the main road, the air was ablaze; you couldn't hear a leaf rustle or a bird cry: Only the insects and midges had escaped this universal rest; some were swarming in the grass, and in the rays of light that slid obliquely under the trees, swarms could be seen swirling about with a dull hum, as if the intense heat had activated their life. 
As soon as I sat down at the foot of a beech tree, I fell asleep, resting my head on my arm. I was woken by a fairly sharp pain in my neck; I put my hand there and picked up a large tawny ant; at the same time I felt another sting in my leg, then another in my chest, then an infinite number of others in all parts of my body. I got undressed quickly and shook off my clothes, knocking over a whole anthill; but this did not cure me of the stings that these cursed beasts had given me. No doubt, like some mosquitoes, they had left a venom in the wound, for I was soon tormented by unbearable itching. Naturally, the more I scratched, the more irritating the pain became; after an hour, my nails were stained with blood.
If you've ever seen sheep in the middle of a plain attacked by a swarm of flies on a stormy day, running here and there, rolling on the ground and tearing themselves apart in the brambles, you can understand the state of exasperation I was in. It seemed to me that if I could get out of the forest, I would suffer less; but the road got longer and longer, and always trees on either side, always a furnace temperature. Finally, at the top of a hill, I saw before me a small river winding through clumps of trees. In ten minutes I reached the banks; in a few seconds I was undressed and in the water.
It was as fresh and green as you find at every step in Normandy. The river, held back by the gates of a mill whose ticking could be heard a short distance away, flowed gently through long, loose grasses that twisted with the current; the water was diaphanously clear, revealing a bottom of fine yellow sand, speckled here and there with mossy pebbles. Groups of alders and aspens planted along the banks blocked out the sun's rays, and under their thick cover, insects buzzed about, sheltered from the heat. On the water, among the leaves of water lilies and watercress, long-legged reapers; in the flowers of aconite, iris and meadowsweet, bluemouths and dragonflies with muslin wings. Scared by the noise I had made when I plunged into the river, some wood pigeons had flown to the top of the aspens, but they soon came down again and, resting on the bank, stuck their heads in the water and shook their ruffled feathers as they cooed, while in the distance more fearful kingfishers flew without daring to approach; When, faster than a bullet, they crossed a ray of sunlight, their azure plumage dazzled the eyes. 
I would have stayed there for several hours, so pleasant was the cold of the water, had I not suddenly heard a voice calling out to me from the very place where I had left my clothes.
- Ah, brigand, I catch you bathing there again! Well, this time you'll come and get your clothes from the Town Hall.
My clothes! my clothes at the Town Hall! that is, my clothes on one side and me on the other, I couldn't believe my ears...
Stunned, I looked at who was talking to me like that: it was a little fat man who, from the side of the road, was showing me his fist; in the middle of his chest, on a grey woollen blouse, shone a badge as yellow as gold.
The little man wasted no time. The deed followed the threat.
He bent down and rolled up my poor clothes in a jumble.
I started shouting:
- Sir! Sir!
- Well," he said, "off to the town hall!
I wanted to get out of the water, run after him, beg him; the fear of the yellow badge and the feeling of my nakedness stopped me: a village warden! a man with a sabre, who can take you to prison! What could I say if he questioned me?
His bundle was packed, he put it under his arm and with the other he threatened me again:
- You'll have to explain yourself at the Town Hall," he said.
And he walked away.
I was so stunned that I forgot to make the movements necessary to stay afloat, and naturally I sank to the bottom.
I soon came to the surface again and ashamedly made my way to the shore and hid in a clump of reeds: their long, flexible leaves curled over me and I was at least safe from prying eyes.
It didn't take me long to realise how unpleasant my position was. How could I go to the town hall to get my clothes? Where was this town hall anyway? In the middle of the village, no doubt! How could I venture out onto the road without any clothes on and cross the streets?
It was all very well to imitate Robinson, but in real life, you don't get out of trouble as quickly as in books.
Since I had left Dol, no matter how unfortunate or painful the difficulties I had encountered, I had never felt absolutely discouraged; but this time I thought I was lost, I felt annihilated, without will, without strength, overwhelmed by an overwhelming despair.
I wept for a long time, but gradually the cold took hold of me and I began to shiver. Two hundred paces away, the sun was falling on the shore, where I could see the grass drying up; there, of course, I would warm myself on the dry sand; but I was so afraid that I didn't dare move. Finally, the cold penetrated me so hard that I took courage, got back into the water and swam to the other side. The bank rose at least two metres above the current; it was hollowed out underneath, and from its top cascaded long stems of bindweed and hop. It was not without some difficulty and some scrapes that I managed to settle in.
It didn't take long for the sun to warm me up, but with the heat came the feeling of life, in other words, a voracious hunger. What was there to eat? The guard had taken my poor money along with my clothes!
The hours went by, however, with no way for me to get out of this position: above me, a few paces away, I could hear cars driving down the road from time to time; but what help could I expect from them? How could I abandon my hiding place in the state I was in? I might have found a way of making myself a garment of leaves, reeds and straw, but I didn't think of it.
The sun began to sink. Night was coming. It was no longer a night under the stars that I had to spend under a haystack, protected by my clothes. Naked, on this little spit of sand, what could I do! The current, always receding before my eyes, had finally given me vertigo; I thought I could already see the foul beasts of the night.
There was hardly an hour's sun left when, on the road, I heard a loud noise of cars following each other, then suddenly the noise stopped: they had stopped just behind me. I couldn't see the road from my hiding place, but I could tell from the clatter of chains and iron that horses were being unhitched. There was a roar, a bellow, a cry that I didn't know, something more nervous than a horse's neigh, more formidable than a donkey's braying, and the birds, already perched in the bushes, flew away with peals; a large rat threw itself into my legs and huddled at the bottom of its hole, whose entrance I blocked.
After a few minutes, it seemed to me that someone was walking in the meadow above me: I wasn't mistaken.
- I've got a chicken," said a voice.
- Where did you get it?
- With a stone at the end of my whip, I took her off the road like a fish in water; it was the others who were shouting!
- We've got to cook it.
- If Cabriole sees us, he'll steal it from us and all we'll have are the bones.
This dialogue was hardly encouraging, but that's precisely why it gave me a desperate audacity that I wouldn't have had with honest people.
I clung to the bank with both hands and, sticking my head through the hop stalks, raised myself so that I could see across the meadow.
The two people I was talking to, whose hoarse, broken voices I had taken for men, were children of about my own age. This emboldened me. I stood up a little higher. My mind was made up.
- If you like..." I said.
They turned round and stood for a moment without seeing where the voice was coming from, for only my head was emerging from the foliage, and, surprised and frightened too, they didn't really know whether to come forward or run away.
- Ah, that head," said one as he caught sight of me.
- A drowning man," said the other.
- Fool! since he's talking.
At the same moment, I heard a big voice shouting from the main road:
- Come on, you lazy bastards, will you pull some grass?
I looked, and in line I saw three long carriages painted yellow and red: -- it was a caravan of acrobats.
- Cabriole! Cabriole!" shouted the two children.
- Well?
- A savage, come and see, Vrai!
Cabriole stepped out into the meadow.
- Where is he, your savage?
- There, in the leaves.
The three of them came closer and, looking at me, burst out laughing.
- What language does he speak, your savage?" asked the one they called Cabriole.
- French, sir," I said.
And I told them about my adventure, which seemed more pleasant to them than to me; they were laughing their heads off.
- La Bouillie," said Cabriole, addressing one of the children, "go and get him a pair of trousers and a smock.
In less than two minutes, La Bouillie was back; I wasted no time getting dressed and jumped on the bank.
- Now," said Cabriole, "let's go and see the boss.
He led me to the first carriage and I climbed up a flight of plank stairs. Around a stove, on which a stew was simmering, I saw a small, dry, shrivelled man, and next to him a woman* *so tall and so fat that she frightened me.
I had to start my story again, and the laughter came again.
- So you were going to sail to Le Havre? said the little man.
- Yes, sir.
- How are you going to pay for my trousers and blouse?
I stood there for a moment without answering; then, summoning up all my courage, I said:
- If you like, I can work for you.
- What can you do? Can you dislocate yourself?
- No, I can't dislocate myself.
- Can you swallow a sword?
- No, I can't swallow a sword.
- Can you play the trumpet, the trombone, the drum?
- No, you can't.
- What have they taught you?" he said to me. "Your education has been singularly neglected, my boy.
- A sad acquisition; he's built like everyone else," said the tall woman, examining me from head to toe, "and he talks about working in the bank.
She shrugged her shoulders and looked away contemptuously. Ah! if I'd been a monster, if I'd had two heads or three arms... But built like everyone else, what a shame!
- Do you know how to look after horses?" asked the little man without letting himself be troubled.
- Yes, sir, I'll try.
- From today you'll be working in the Count de Lapolade's menagerie, famous, I dare say, as much for the beauty of the animals it contains as for the courage of the illustrious Diélette, Diélette, our daughter, who tamed them. Follow Cabriole, he'll show you what to do, and come back in an hour for supper.
In my position I had no choice of state. I couldn't be difficult. I accepted the strange resource offered to me as a blessing.
X
So here I was, an acrobat or, to put it less vanity bluntly, a servant to the horses in the caravan of the Count of Lapolade.
He had perfectly authentic parchments which he willingly displayed on special occasions and which gave him the right to bear this title. After a life troubled by every vice and passion, he had come to this. To complete his degradation, in a supreme hour of distress, he had married the great woman who had welcomed me so badly. Famous in all the fairs of Europe under the name of la forte Bordelaise, although she was born in Auvergne, she had in her youth occupied the high position of phenomenon, that is to say of colossal woman. One painting showed her in a pink dress, delicately resting her huge leg in white stockings on a stool; another showed her in a blue velvet spencer, a foil in her hand, her opponent being a Carabinieri brigadier not quite as tall as she was, with this inscription in gold letters: "À vous, monsieur le militaire" ("To you, Mr Soldier").
She had won a fair amount of money at this job, which tempted de Lapolade. Lapolade's only fortune was his talent as a barker, but this talent was remarkable; no one in the bank was as strong as he was in making an irresistible pitch at the door; his reputation equalled that of Mangin and Turquetin. He and the strong woman from Bordeaux had formed a partnership, and this handsome couple had bought a menagerie which, in its early years, rivalled that of the famous Huguet de Massilia. But Lapolade's strength was also his weakness: his mouth was expensive, he was drunk and greedy.
Some animals, badly cared for and fed, had died, others had been sold; and when I entered the caravan, it consisted only of an old lion, two hyenas, a snake and a learned horse, which by day pulled the carriage and by night said who was the stupidest person in the company.
At supper I made the acquaintance of the human staff: apart from Monsieur and Madame de Lapolade, it consisted of Cabriole, the clown, Bouillie, the second child whom I had already seen and who was called Filasse, two Germans, one playing the clarinet, Hermann, the other the drum, Carolus; lastly the illustrious Diélette, who was a little girl of eleven or twelve, frail and nervous-looking, with large periwinkle-blue eyes. 
Although I was just a servant, I was admitted to the table of these famous people.
It was a long, wide white wooden box which occupied the middle of the carriage; it served a triple purpose: inside it, the costumes were set; on it, at mealtimes, the plates were placed, and at night a mattress which was the bed at Diélette; around this box, two other narrower ones were lined up: these were benches for the troupe, as only Monsieur and Madame de Lapolade had chairs.
Thus furnished, this first compartment of the carriage looked good, and many Parisian homes do not have such a large dining room. A double-glazed door opened onto the outside gallery, and through two small windows trimmed with draped red curtains you could see the trees along the road.
I had to start telling my story all over again, but I did so without naming my mother, my uncle or my real country. When I got to the gendarme episode, Diélette declared that I was a simpleton, and that in my place she would have had a good laugh: the two musicians approved this boast, not in words - they never spoke - but with three bursts of laughter, in unison, of that tremendous laughter which belongs only to the Bavarians.
When supper was over, there was still some light in the sky.
- Come on, my children," said Lapolade, "let's take advantage of the day that's left to loosen up a bit; let's not rust our muscles.
And he took his place on the outside gallery of the carriage, where Diélette brought him his lighted pipe, while Filasse and La Bouillie lowered a small box with a lid onto the grass. Filasse then undid his smock and, after shaking his head as if he wanted to get rid of it and stretching his arms and legs, removed the lid and stuffed himself into the box, where he disappeared. I was amazed, because it was so small that I wouldn't have dared put a one-year-old in it.
It was La Bouillie's turn; despite all his efforts he couldn't disappear into the box; from the top of his gallery, Lapolade struck him on the shoulders with a vigorous whip.
- You've eaten too much again," he said, "tomorrow I'll ration you.
Then he turned to me and said
- Come on! Now it's your turn.
I took three or four steps backwards to get out of the whip's reach.
- In there?" I said.
- Not yet, my boy, just show us what you can and jump that ditch.
The ditch was wide and deep; I jumped two feet further than I had to.
Lapolade was very pleased and declared that I would succeed on the trapeze.
The first carriage was that of the bosses, the second that of the animals; the third served as a dormitory for the troupe and a shop for the accessories. As there was no bed for me in it, they gave me two bales of straw and I made one for myself underneath.
Although this bed was better than my previous ones, I didn't fall asleep for a long time. The lights went out, the noises ceased; soon all I could hear in the deep stillness of the evening was the trampling of the horses, which, tied to the carriages, were pulling on their tethers to pinch the powdery grass of the path around them; From time to time, in the menagerie, I could hear the lion's powerful breath, sighing plaintively, as if the silence and the heat of that summer night had reminded him of the African solitudes, and sometimes I could also hear his tail impatiently beating his flanks as if a gleam of courage, rising in his stupefied will, had spoken to him of revolt and freedom. 
He was in a tightly closed cage; I was in the open air. For a moment, I thought of taking advantage of this to continue on my way; but these clothes given to me by Lapolade, I had to take them with me. That would have meant stealing them. After all, he wouldn't be tougher than my uncle, and the day I paid him in labour what I owed him, I'd be free.
The caravan went to Falaise, to the Guibray fair: it was there that, for the first time, I saw Diélette enter the lion's cage, and heard Lapolade make his pitch.
The costumes had been taken from the vaults; Diélette, over her swimming costume, had put on a silver dress spangled with gold; on her head was a crown of roses. My comrades Filasse and La Bouillie were dressed as red devils; the two Germans as Polish lancers with plumes in their eyes. As for me, I had been dyed like a Negro, my arms up to my elbows, my head up to my chest; I represented a slave who had come with the lion, and I was forbidden to say a single word of French. I was a slave who had come with the lion, and I was forbidden to say a single word of French. My mother herself would not have recognised me in this disguise. This was what Lapolade had wanted most of all, as he wasn't sure that there wouldn't be someone from my country in the crowd.
Cabriole had finished his parade, Diélette had danced a step with the Bouillie, when Lapolade appeared on the stage in the costume of a general. The crowd we had amassed was compact; my eyes were truly dazzled by the whiteness of the cotton bonnets that topped all the Norman heads stretched out towards us. The General made a gesture and the music stopped.
Then he leaned towards me and handed me the cigar he was smoking:
- Keep it for me," he said, "while I talk.
I was staring at him in amazement when I was kicked from behind.
- The boss offers him a cigar and he plays dumb!
The audience deigned to find this joke very funny and burst out laughing with applause.
I had never smoked; I didn't even know whether to inhale or exhale, but this was no time for explanations: with one hand Cabriole pulled my chin, with the other he raised my nose, and into my open mouth Lapolade suddenly inserted his cigar. My grimaces were certainly comical, for the peasants were holding their ribs.
The general lifted his hat and there was silence.
-- You see before you," he said, "the famous Lapolade. -- Who's that, Lapolade? This charlatan in a general's uniform? -- Himself. -- And why, you ask, does such an illustrious man dress in such a ridiculous manner? -- To please you, my lords, and because, if you are all, taken individually, honest people, together in public, you can be nothing but fools.
There was an uneasy movement in the crowd and some murmuring.
Lapolade, without losing his assurance, took his cigar from me, sucked in a few puffs, and then, to my great despair and disgust, put it back between my lips:
- Hey there, you, sir," he continued, "yes, the man with the wick helmet and the red nose, why are you murmuring? Is it because I said that you were an honest man at home and a fool in this square? Well, I apologise; at home you're a joker, and in this square you're a clever one.
The crowd erupted in cheers, then, when the emotion had subsided a little, he continued:
- So if I wasn't dressed up as a general, instead of all of you standing there staring at me with your mouths open and your eyes as round as marbles, you'd all be on your way.
"But I know humanity, and I know the kind of stupidity you have to deal with. So I went to Germany to find the two illustrious musicians you see here. I have recruited into my troupe the famous Filasse, whose fame you are undoubtedly aware of, the Bouillie, and finally the prodigious Cabriole, about whom I have nothing to say since you have heard him. Then you stop, your curiosity aroused, and ask yourself: "What is this one playing?
"Come on, musicians, a little tune.
This parade, which he varied according to the country and the listeners, I could repeat to you word for word, because I still find it whole in my memory. It's incredible how certain absurdities can be engraved in the brain when it's so difficult for good things to stick.
However, that day I only heard the first part clearly; the cigar smoke had turned my heart, and I was in a true state of hallucination and daze when I passed into the barracks. According to the role I had been assigned, I was to open the cages when Diélette entered.
It was through a kind of mist that I saw her coming towards me: in one hand she was holding a riding crop, in the other she was blowing kisses to the audience. In their cages, the hyenas whirled around with slow, limping steps; in hers, with his head resting on his paws, the lion seemed to be asleep.
- Open the door, slave!
And she entered. The lion didn't move. Then, with her small hands, she grabbed both his ears and pulled with all her strength to lift his head. He didn't move. Impatience overtook her, and she nailed him on the shoulder with her riding crop. As if pushed by a spring, he reared up on his two hind legs with a roar so appalling that I felt my legs tremble; fear added to the fumes that lifted my stomach, to the intoxication of tobacco that made everything in and around me spin, my heart failed me completely, and I fell to the ground.
Lapolade was a clever man who knew how to take advantage of the slightest incident.
- See how ferocious this beast is," he exclaimed, "its roar alone makes the children of his country faint.
My discomfort was so obvious to everyone that the audience, quite sure that this was not a scene prepared in advance, burst into long applause, while Cabriole took me in his arms to throw me like a bundle of clothes behind the barracks.
Throughout the performance I stayed there, horribly ill, unable to make a move, yet aware of what was going on around me, the roars of the lion, the cries of the hyenas, the cheers of the audience.
Then I heard the trampling of the crowd as they left and, a few moments later, I felt my arm being pulled. It was Diélette; she had a glass in her hand.
- Here, drink this," she said, "it's sweet water: you're stupid to have been afraid for me! But it doesn't matter, you're a good boy.
That was the first word she'd said to me since I joined the troupe; this sign of sympathy did me good; it seemed to me that I was less alone; Filasse and La Bouillie had joined forces to play all the bad tricks in their bag on me, and I was happy to meet a comrade.
The next day, I wanted to thank her, but she turned her back on me without listening, and never said another word or looked at me again. I had to get back to my ideas of friendship; then, as I was beginning to get fed up with this life where kicks rained down, and as I was beginning to think that by looking after horses, cleaning animal cages during the day, and playing the negro at night, I had well earned the bad canvas trousers and blouse I had been given, I thought of abandoning the caravan to continue my journey to Le Havre. Poor Mummy! Was it to stay with those acrobats that I had left her! Ah! if she could see me, if she knew the truth!
The season was advancing; the nights were getting cold, the days were often rainy; it would soon be impossible to sleep out in the open under the stars. We had to hurry, and all the more so as, on leaving Guibray, we would have to go down towards the Loire and away from Le Havre.
However, as I didn't want to venture out without taking precautions, I stocked up on all the crusts I could spare and used the time I had free to make myself some shoes from old boot stems. My plan was set. The first night the caravan was on the road, I would run away.
On the eve of the day fixed for the departure, I was working on these shoes when Diélette surprised me.
- You want to run away," she said in a low voice.
I made a gesture to interrupt her.
- I've been watching you for eight days," she continued; "you've got a supply of bread under the oat chest, and that's for something; but don't be afraid, I won't betray you, and if you want, I'll run away with you.
- I said to her with the accent of someone who knew what it was to abandon one's parents.
- My father! These people are neither my father nor my mother; but we could be surprised here; go and wait for me in the fortifications, I'll try to join you; if you're a good boy, you'll help me and I'll help you.
I spent more than two hours wandering around in the ditches without seeing her arrive, and I was beginning to think that she had wanted to make fun of me when she appeared.
- Come and hide us over there in the cedar trees," she said, "we mustn't be seen together, or they'll suspect something.
I followed her, and when we were deep in a thick cedar and alder bush, well hidden from all eyes, she stopped.
- First," she said, "I have to tell you my story, so you'll understand why I want to run away.
Although we were the same age, when Diélette spoke to me she had the tone of authority that a grown-up takes with a child, and I didn't quite understand how, being so self-assured, she needed the help of a weakling like me; but as I felt a lively sympathy for her, and as she was in control of my secret, I didn't balk and went straight into my role as confidant.
- Lapolade is not my father," she continued, "I never knew my father. My mother was a haberdashery merchant in Paris, in a street near Les Halles. I don't remember my mother's name, nor the name of the street she lived in. All I remember is that Mum was a beautiful young woman with big blonde hair, so long, so long that in the morning, when my brother and I were playing on her bed, we could hide under it as if we were under a bush.
"She loved us very much, always kissed us and never beat us. My brother was a bit bigger than me; his name was Eugène. In the morning there were piles of cabbages, carrots and all sorts of vegetables on the pavement, and from the doorway you could see opposite, against a tall church, a beautiful gilded sundial; above it there was a little tower and on this tower big black arms that moved from side to side all day long. When, last year, I spoke about this to a straw worker in Masson's troupe, who had come from Paris, he told me that this church was the church of Saint-Eustache, and that these big black arms were a telegraph.
"As Mum worked all day, she hardly ever went out with us, and she had an apprentice take us for a walk. One day, it was in the summer, because it was hot and there was a lot of dust in the streets, they took me to the gingerbread fair; it's a fair held at the Barrière du Trône; you must have heard about it since you've been in the caravan. I don't remember why my brother wasn't with us, but he stayed at home.
"It was the first time I'd seen an acrobat, and I was very amused. I wanted to go into all the huts, but the apprentice had no money, and I had only four sous, which had been given to me to buy cakes; she took them from me, and we entered an entre-sort.
-- What's all this?
-- You're silly! You don't know what an entre-sort is! So what do you know? Well, it's a barrack where they show a phenomenon, a colossal woman, a living seal, or something else.
"In this one, they showed two seals in a tank. I don't know how it happened, but the apprentice had a chat with the man in between; he looked at me a lot and said I was very nice. He went out with us and we went to a wine merchant's, in a small dark room where there was nobody. I was tired and hot, and while they were drinking sweet wine from a bowl, I fell asleep.
"When I woke up, it was almost dark and the apprentice was gone.
"I asked the man where she was; he told me that if I wanted we could go and find her. I followed him. There were a lot of people on the pavements, the stalls were lit up and all the music was playing. He took me by the hand and pulled me along very quickly.
"Soon we were out of the crowd; we were on a very wide road, bordered on either side by avenues of trees; there were hardly any lights and only a few houses here and there.
"He offered to carry me, but I refused. He wanted to take me in his arms, but I screamed.
Why are you shouting?" he said; "we're going to join your mother.
"I started walking again; the road seemed much longer than when I came, and then I didn't recognise it; we passed some big dark walls and a big gate where there were soldiers on sentry duty, and we entered a wood that didn't end. I was quite afraid and stopped.
Do you want to walk, you bad pest," said the man in his big voice, "or you'll have to deal with me.
"No one passed by, but he pulled me very hard, and I followed him, crying. You see, I wasn't yet five, I wasn't brave and I was thinking about Mum.
"I don't know how long he made me walk, but I was quite tired when we saw the lights of a village; at the entrance, on a square, against the wall of the wood, there were travelling acrobats' wagons; we got into one of these wagons. We entered one of these carriages, where we were met by a legless woman drinking brandy.
"He spoke low in her ear, and they both looked at me a lot.
Can't you see?" said the woman, "she has a sign on her cheek.
"This sign was a little pink currant, where there is now a little hole.
Bast," said the man, "we'll make it disappear.
"Fear took hold of me and I asked where Mummy was.
She'll come tomorrow morning, sweetheart," said the woman, "today you must be very good and go to bed.
She may be hungry," said the man.
"Well then, we'll give the little darling something to eat.
"It was then that I noticed that the woman had no legs; she walked by twirling and leaning on her hands. This surprised me greatly and did little to reassure me; but as she gave me something good for supper, very large peas from the pot, I ate very well.
The old woman said, as she saw me devouring the peas without salt or butter, "She's not fussy about her food!
"She didn't know that this was an unparalleled treat for me, which I was forbidden to eat at home, as the doctor only allowed me to eat roast meat because I was often ill.
Now we must go to bed," she said when I had finished.
"And she drew a mattress-covered curtain that hid the back of the carriage; behind it were two beds.
"In fact, it was very funny to sleep in a carriage. I fell asleep perfectly.
"When I woke up, it seemed to me that my bed was dancing; I thought I was dreaming, but I was swinging to the right and to the left, and I heard a noise of bells and chains. Above my bed there was a small window through which light was streaming in; I got down on my knees and looked out: it was barely daylight and the trees stretched past the window; in the distance, over a meadow, I could see a river. I realised that my bedroom and my bed were working and my memory came back to me. I started calling out, "Mummy! Mummy!" A big voice that I didn't know answered me:
"We're going to meet her.
"But I was very frightened, so I shouted louder.
"Then a man I hadn't seen before got into the car; he was very tall, and his head, wearing a police cap, was touching the ceiling of the car.
"If you scream, I'll kill you.
"I thought he was going to strangle me, and I tried to repress my screams.
"As soon as he was out, I looked for my clothes; I could not find them, and, not daring to ask for them, I remained on the bed.
"The carriage drove on for a long time, sometimes on pavement, sometimes on sand; through the window I could see that we were passing through villages. At last it stopped and the legless woman got in.
Where's Mummy?" I said to her.
"Bye, sweetheart.
"She spoke softly, which encouraged me.
"I'd like to get up.
"That's what I came to suggest: here are your clothes.
"And she showed me a bad dress.
"This is not my dress.
"It's the right one.
"I wanted to rebel and tear the rag to pieces, but the legless woman looked at me so intelligibly that I obeyed.
"When I was dressed in this ugly dress, the carriage stopped, and the legless woman told me that I could get out. We were in the middle of a great plain, and all around us, as far as the eye could see, were green fields; the man in the police cap had lit a fire on the main road, and on three sticks, joined together in a bundle, hung a pot. I was very hungry, and it pleased me to hear the pot singing.
"The legless woman had remained in the carriage; the man went to take her in his arms and lower her onto the road.
The sign?" she said, looking at me.
"That's true, I didn't think of it any more.
"Then the wicked man took me between his legs and held me so tightly that I couldn't move. The legless woman then lifted my head with one hand, and with the other, using scissors that she held open, she cut the gooseberry head from my cheek.
"Blood gushed out, filled my mouth and flooded my dress; I thought she wanted to kill me and I began to cry out terribly, trying to bite her. Unperturbed, she put something on my cheek that burned, and the blood stopped.
Let her go now," she said to the man.
"She thought I was going to run away. I was! I jumped on her and hit her with all my strength.
"I think she would have strangled me if the man hadn't picked me up and thrown me into the carriage where he locked me up.
"They kept me there all day without eating; only in the evening did they open the door. The first thing I said was to ask for my mother.
She's dead," said the legless woman.
"I had been thinking the whole time I had been locked up.
"It's not true, Mum isn't dead, you're a thief.
"She laughed, which exasperated me.
"For three weeks or a month, I stayed with the legless woman and the man in the police cap. They had thought that they would tame me, as they tame animals, through hunger; but they couldn't. To eat, I did what I could. To eat, I did what they wanted; but once I'd eaten, I didn't do anything else. The legless woman knew that I would never forgive her for the operation she had performed on my cheek, and sometimes she said she was afraid* *of me, that I was capable of stabbing her.
"We had arrived in a country whose name I don't know, but where bread is called brod and where there are many rivers; then seeing that they could get nothing from me, they sold me to a blind man, who was no more blind than you, but who pretended to have lost his eyes in order to beg. All day long I had to stand on a bridge and hold out my hand. Luckily he had a poodle, and when I got home in the evening I could play with that dog; otherwise I'd have died of grief.
"I wasn't at all inclined to beg and, as I didn't want to torment people who didn't give me anything and follow them crying, I was caned every day. Tired of beating me, the blind man sold me to some travelling musicians to collect money while they played.
"I've been to England, and also to America, where it's so cold that you ride around in wheelless carriages that slide on the snow. You have to cross the sea to get there, and it takes more than a month by boat.
"The musicians sold me to Lapolade when we returned to France. In those days, we had three lions, one of which was very mean, but which immediately became very gentle with me; when I brought him his dinner, he licked my hands.
"One day, annoyed that I couldn't perform a difficult trick, Lapolade gave me a beating; I screamed as much as I could. It was in front of my lion's cage; now this good lion got angry at seeing me beaten; he stretched his paw through the bars, grabbed Lapolade by the shoulder and pulled him to himself. Lapolade tried to get away, but the lion had dug his claws into his skin and was holding on tight. If someone hadn't come along with iron sticks, Lapolade would have stayed there.
"He was sick for two months, but that gave him the idea of getting me into the cages.
Since the lions are your friends," Madame told me, "they won't eat you; besides, the fat man would defend you.
"I liked that better than suspension, and since then "the illustrious Diélette has tamed the ferocious children of the desert with her charms", as the parade says. What a beast these ferocious desert children are! They're gentler than dogs. Ah, if my poor fat Redhead wasn't dead, you'd see! I put all three of them in the same cage; I whipped the other two as much as I could, and when they started to get angry, I said to Rougeaud: "Defend me". Immediately he came forward with such a terrible roar that everyone trembled. Then I'd pretend to faint; he'd lick my face; they'd open the gate; he'd carry me away in his mouth. If you had seen the applause, the bouquets, the cakes, the beautiful ladies kissing me!
"I was so successful that Lapolade was asked to go to Paris. Think how happy I was: in Paris, I'd be able to escape and find Mum.
"But just as he was about to leave, Rougeaud fell ill; it was winter, and he was so cold he was always shivering. Ah, I looked after him well, I slept with him under the blankets; in spite of that, he died all the same.
"I've never had so much grief; they thought I was going to die. The caravan didn't go to Paris, and we had to give up seeing Mum again.
"Since then I've thought about running away, but I don't dare to do it on my own, and I don't trust Filasse and La Bouillie. You're not from the bank, so will you help me find Mum? You'll see how happy she'll be and how she'll kiss you.
Paris wasn't Le Havre, and it was my turn to tell Diélette my true story.
- Well, come to Paris," she said, "Mum will pay for your trip to Le Havre and we'll take you there.
I tried again to make her understand how difficult it was to live on the main roads; how to eat? how to sleep?
- I've got seven francs and eight cents," she said; "we'll use them to eat; we'll sleep outside; if you're near me, I won't be afraid.
This mark of confidence, while making me very proud, completely convinced me: after all, Diélette was a small person who could not be resisted, and she had a way of looking at you with her big blue eyes full of shyness and boldness, candour and experience, gentleness and hardness, which did not suffer the refusal of contradiction.
So it was decided that at Orléans we would abandon the caravan.
- Until then," she said, "I won't talk to you in front of the world; you're too good a child, you'd give yourself away.
I grimaced. She understood that I was not very flattered by this compliment.
- Give me a handshake," she said, "it's because you're such a good boy that I trust you.
XI
It was Saturday, market day, and the streets were full of peasants; in the main square, which I crossed to get back to my cars, Filasse and La Bouillie stopped in front of Turquetin, who, to the sound of the bass drum and the trombone, was pulling out teeth so quickly that you could see them flying through the air as if he had been playing with jacks.
Very young at the time, Turquetin did not yet have the fame that thirty years of battles against the Norman jaws, braver than they were strong, had so rightly earned him; but already his sure hand, and above all his good-natured good humour, had made him popular in all the departments of the West; the crowd was packed around his carriage.
When I saw him in the middle of the Turquetin crowd, I thought he was there to have fun, and I stayed to see what mischief he would come up with: only, as more than once he had been slapped in the face at this game, I kept cautiously away.
Good for me.
That day, the game for my two comrades consisted in taking their snuffboxes from the people who were snuffing, and their handkerchiefs from those who weren't snuffing. Naturally it was La Bouillie, with his dexterous hands, who was in charge of searching the pockets. Filasse's role was to replace the tobacco in a snuffbox with coffee grounds, and to smear it with tobacco when a clean handkerchief was passed to him.
Listening attentively to Turquetin's pitch, their eyes fixed on the unfortunate patient who was waiting to be operated on, their ears full of the sound of the bass drum or the quack's outbursts, oblivious to everything else, the peasants allowed themselves to be searched as if they were lifeless dummies.
Some had already pulled out their handkerchiefs and sneezed frantically, to the great delight of the two accomplices, who were writhing in laughter; others, after taking their snuff, looked at their snuffboxes with such genuinely comical surprise that I felt like taking an active part in this mystification.
But as I was about to join my comrades, I saw a policeman sneak up behind La Bouillie and, just as La Bouillie was putting his hand in an old woman's pocket, grab him by the collar. There was a great commotion in the crowd, a rumour, and Filasse was also arrested.
Without trying to see more, I freed myself from some of the people around me and, trembling with fear, hurried back to our camp, where I told them what had just happened.
An hour later, the law arrived to search our cars. Naturally nothing was found, as my two comrades were not thieves. However, they were kept in prison and Lapolade's explanations, aimed at persuading the magistrates that it was just a bad joke played by two kids, were so badly received that he didn't insist, for fear of being arrested himself as an accomplice, or at least as a fence. The police are not kind to travelling acrobats, and if a crime is committed in a country while they are passing through, they are the first to be accused; against them, it is not necessary to prove that they are guilty, and it is up to them, on the contrary, to prove that they have done nothing.
Filasse and La Bouillie, caught with their hands in the pockets of peasants, could not prove that they did not mean to steal, and they were sentenced to detention in a reformatory until they came of age.
It was decided that, to fill the gap their absence had created in the troupe, I would replace them both. I cried out loud at Lapolade's proposal, because I had no vocation for dislocating myself and locking myself up in boxes.
- There's no question of boxes," he said, tugging at my hair, which in his eyes was a caress and a sign of benevolence; "you're supple, you'll do very well in aerobatics.
It was at the Alençon fair that I made my debut. Unfortunately my education had not gone very far, and although my exercises were very simple, they nevertheless gave rise to an accident which disrupted our plans to escape.
It was a Sunday: we had begun our performances at noon, and, without a minute's interruption, we had continued them into the evening; the parched musicians could hardly blow into their instruments; Lapolade could only utter a few cries, which were more of a bark than a cheer; the lion wouldn't get up, and when Diélette threatened him with his riding crop, he fixed his sleepy eyes on her without moving, begging for mercy; as for me, I was dead tired, I was hungry, I was thirsty, I couldn't move my arms or my legs. 
At eleven o'clock there were still people in front of our hut, and Lapolade decided that we should give one last performance.
- We're exhausted, but even if we all die of exhaustion, we owe it to your curiosity. Come in, come in!
The show began with my exercises: they consisted of somersaults over four horses and feats of strength at the end of a pole held by Cabriole. I didn't do my jumps very well, and the audience murmured. When Cabriole presented me with the pole, I was tempted to say I couldn't take it any more, but Lapolade's eyes fixed on me with an expression I understood only too well, my self-esteem and the excitement of the crowd made up my mind; I jumped on Cabriole's shoulders and climbed the pole quite easily.
Cabriole was tired too; just as I was pulling myself up horizontally to form an angle with the pole, I felt it wobble; my blood stopped; I opened my fingers and let myself fall, stretching out my hands.
The crowd screamed, I hit the ground; it was a hard blow, because I fell from a height of five metres, and without the layer of sawdust, I would certainly have broken; I felt a violent pain in my shoulder with a little crack.
I got up immediately and, as I had seen myself do, I wanted to wave to the audience, who were standing on the benches, looking at me anxiously; but I couldn't raise my right arm...
They had surrounded me; everyone was talking to me at once; they were suffocating me; I was in great pain and my heart was failing me.
- It will be nothing," said Lapolade, "please take your seats, the performance will continue.
- He won't be able to do that," said Cabriole, raising both arms above his head.
And the audience applauded, laughing wildly.
In fact, for six weeks I couldn't do what Cabriole said, because I had a broken collarbone.
In the bank, we don't usually have much recourse to doctors; it was Lapolade himself who put a bandage on my shoulder when the performance was over. As an internal remedy, he put me to bed without supper.
I lived alone in the animal carriage. I had been on my bed for more than two hours, unable to sleep, burnt by a feverish thirst, tossing and turning angrily without finding a good position for my shoulder, when it seemed to me that the carriage door was being gently opened.
- It's me," said Diélette in a low voice, "are you asleep?
- I'm not asleep.
She entered quickly and, coming to my bed, kissed me.
- It's for me," she said, "will you forgive me?
- Will you forgive me?
- If I'd let you go, you wouldn't have fallen today.
Through the skylight, the full moonlight hit Diélette's face; I thought I saw tears in her eyes. I tried to be brave.
- It's nothing," I said, "do you think I'm cosy?
I tried to stretch out my arm, but a sharp pain made me cry out.
- You see," she said, "it's for me, for me.
And with a sudden movement, she undid her straightjacket.
- Here, look," she said.
- Look at what?
- Feel here.
She gently took my hand and put it on her arm; I felt like blood.
- When I saw that your shoulder was broken," she said, "I bit my arm as hard as I could to make it hurt, because when we're friends, we have to suffer together.
She said this with the energy of a savage, and her eyes reflected the moonlight as if they were diamonds; what she had done was absurd, but I felt moved and wanted to cry.
- I brought you some grapes from the trunk, are you hungry?
- I'm thirsty, grapes will do me good.
She went to get me another cup of water, without making more noise than a shadow.
- Now," she said, "you need to get some sleep -- she leaned my head on the bolster -- you need to get better very quickly so that we can get away; the day you can walk, we'll leave; I don't want you to go up the pole again, that's not the job for you.
- What if Lapolade forces me?
- Him! I'd rather have him eaten by Mouton; it's not difficult, really; one swipe, one bite, snap!
On the doorstep, before closing it again, she made a friendly gesture:
- Go to sleep!
It seemed to me that my shoulder was less sore; I found a position to lie down and fall asleep, thinking of my mother, my heart moved but not too saddened.
The most unfortunate thing about my accident was that it delayed our escape and inevitably brought us to the wrong season. I could have slept out in the open during the fine summer nights, but in November, when the nights would be long and cold, with rain and snow perhaps!
Diélette wouldn't let me do anything, and it was she who looked after the animals; she was more impatient than I was to see me cured, and when I told her sometimes that it would be wiser to wait until spring, she got angry.
- If you stay with them," she said, "you'll be dead by spring. Lapolade wants to teach you a trapeze trick, you won't get away with it. Besides, we're always moving away from Paris; by spring we might be in the South of France.
That was a decisive reason.
We had to hurry to get better. Every morning I passed the inspection in front of Diélette; to do this, I leaned my back against the partition of the car and raised my arm as much as I could. With her knife, she made a mark on* *the partition at the height where I stopped, and thus, by comparing this height with that of the day before, we followed day by day the progress of the cure.
From Alençon we had come to Vendôme and from Vendôme to Blois; from Blois we were to go to Tours, where I would resume my exercises; it was therefore decided with Diélette that at Blois we would leave the caravan and that, via Orléans, we would set off for Paris. She had given me her money, and I had bought an old road map of France from a second-hand dealer in Vendôme; with a hairpin I had made myself a compass and counted the distance from Blois to Paris as forty leagues; that was a long way in November, when the days are barely ten hours long. Could Diélette, who didn't know how to walk, do stages of six leagues? She bravely claimed she could, but I doubted it. In any case, it was a week's journey; fortunately she had increased her savings, which now amounted to ten francs; our provisions were made, my shoes were finished, and she had been lucky enough to pick up an old horse blanket on the road, which we were counting on to wrap us up for the night.
We were therefore ready and could only leave once my shoulder was completely healed, which, according to our calculations and especially according to the progress noted by the notches in the partition, should coincide with the end of our stay in Blois; but a revolt by Mouton, who is usually so peaceful, delayed us again.
One evening, two Englishmen, who had applauded Diélette a great deal, approached her when the audience had left, and asked that she resume her exercises. Lapolade accepted this proposal with all the more eagerness as it was made by two men who seemed to have been disposed to generosity by an abundant dinner. Diélette returned to the cage.
- What a charming child!
- Very brave!
And they started applauding again.
I don't know what feeling of self-love aroused Lapolade's jealousy, but he said that if she could play so peacefully with the lion, it was due to the education he, Lapolade, had given her.
- You," said the smaller of the two Englishmen, a very pretty pink and blond boy, "you're a joker, you wouldn't get into the cage.
- Ten louis against one that you don't enter, said the second.
- I've got them.
- Fine, but the little girl will leave, and you'll go in alone.
It is perhaps a prejudice to believe that it takes great courage to enter the cages of ferocious beasts.
- The riding crop," said Lapolade to Diélette.
- Agreed," said the little Englishman, "that the child will go away and never come back.
- Agreed.
We were all there, Cabriole, Madame Lapolade, the musicians and I, who had to open the cage door.
Lapolade got rid of his general's costume.
- If this lion is intelligent," said one of the Englishmen, "he won't harm it; it's too tough a meat.
And they both started joking, making fun of our boss, which made us laugh.
Mouton was intelligent enough to have kept the memory of the blows with the handle of the fork that Lapolade often administered to him through the bars, and he began to tremble when Lapolade gravely entered the cage, whip high.
Lapolade was encouraged by the animal's attitude; he thought he had the old lion under control and jabbed him with his whip to make him stand up, but whacks with a whip are not like jabs with a pitchfork. Mouton understood that he had his enemy in his power; a flash of courage struck his stupefied brain; he rose to his feet with a roar, and before Lapolade could take a step, he let himself fall on top of him. Lapolade collapsed under the two formidable paws, the nails of which could be seen clenching, and the lion rolled him under his belly with a hoarse howl.
- I'm dead!" cried Lapolade.
Bent over, the lion looked at us through the grate; his eyes shot flames; he beat his flanks with his tail, which sounded like a drum.
Cabriole grabbed a pitchfork and struck it with double blows; it didn't move. Then one of the Englishmen drew a revolver from his pocket and held it up to the lion's ear, which was almost touching the bars.
But Madame Lapolade quickly raised her arm.
- Don't kill him!" she cried.
- Aoh!" said the Englishman, "she likes her lion better than her husband.
And he muttered a few words in a foreign language.
The noise and the cries had attracted Diélette; she ran towards the cage. One of the bars was arranged in such a way that if she was surprised, it would open up and allow her slender body to pass through, but the lion would not be able to stick his big head through. She pushed this bar aside and entered the cage without Mouton, who had his back to her, seeing her.
She didn't have a whip, so she bravely pounced on his mane. Surprised by this attack and not knowing where it came from, he turned around so suddenly that he knocked her against the bars; but when he saw who she was, he let down his paw, which had already been thrown to crush her, and, rising from Lapolade, he went to huddle in a corner.
Lapolade was not dead, but so badly bruised that he had to be pulled out by the strength of his arms, while Diélette kept her gaze on the ashamed lion.
She limped out of the room herself: the lion had twisted her leg, and she had a sprain that kept her on a chair for eight days, while Lapolade lay in bed, half-dead, torn and spitting blood.
Finally, after a fortnight, she told me that she could walk very well without pain, and that the time had come to put our project into effect; held back by his wounds, Lapolade could not pursue us.
It was 3 November, but the autumn was fine; if we hurried, we could hope to arrive in Paris before the bad weather.
Our plan, discussed at length, had been definitively decided as follows: as I wasn't being watched, I would be the first to leave the hut, taking all the luggage with me, i.e. the supply of crusts, the blanket, a bottle, my spare shoes, a small bundle of washing that Diélette had hidden in my box, a tin pan, in short, a whole removal; then, when the Lapolade couple were asleep, Diélette would get up, escape from the car and come and join me near a tree that we had marked on the boulevard. 
I got there just as eleven o'clock struck. Diélette didn't meet me there until midnight. I was beginning to despair and I feared that she had been surprised, when I heard her light footstep on the earth of the boulevard; she cut a strip of light and I recognised the red cape that she used to wrap herself in when, coming out of the show, she came to watch the parade.
- I thought I'd never escape," she gasped; Lapolade was moaning like a seal, he wouldn't fall asleep, and then I went to say goodbye to Mouton. Poor Mouton! He's the one who's going to be sad. Have you got everything?
It wasn't the time to take inventory; I told her that we could be caught and that we had to hurry to the countryside.
- Let's go," she said, "but first give me your hand.
- What for?
- So that you can put it in mine and we can both swear that it's life and death. Will you swear to that?
- I will.
- Then give me your hand and say as I do: We will help each other in life and in death!
- In life and in death!
She shook my hand, and I felt quite moved by the accent with which she pronounced this formula.
There was a mysterious silence in the deserted city, disturbed only by the sound of a fountain splashing in the stream, and also by the wailing of the street lamps which, in the wind, screamed at the end of their iron chains: their swaying made great shifting shadows on the pavement of the street.
- Now, let's walk," she said, taking the lead.
We soon left the city and found ourselves in the fields; as I followed her, I examined her curiously; it seemed to me that her left arm was rounded, as if she were carrying something under her cloak. Since I had all the luggage, what could it be? I asked her.
- It's my reseda," she said, opening her cape.
She had always grown this flower, which was in one of the windows of the car and for which I had seen her make tyrannical demands on more than one occasion, which infuriated Lapolade.
- How do you expect us to carry this?" I said, rather annoyed by this new overload.
- She'd be dead: that's enough about Mouton. Poor Mouton! Don't you know that just now I wanted to take him away. How he looked at me! Of course, he suspected something.
Taking Mouton away was an idea that struck me as extremely funny. Probably on a lead, like a dog. I couldn't help smiling.
Diélette wanted to share the luggage and I found it very difficult to take more than she did.
Without being cold, the night was cool; the sky was riddled with twinkling stars against a greyish-blue background; everything on the plain was asleep; the trees stood stiff and motionless, without a rustle or a murmur, and we heard none of the sounds of birds or insects that make summer nights so lively; Only from time to time, as we passed a dwelling, the dogs would chase us with their barking, their voices awakening other voices in the vicinity, and their barking would fade into the silent darkness like the cry of sentries warning and answering each other. 
In order to protect ourselves from pursuit, if Lapolade wanted to undertake any, we had to walk all night. I had feared that Diélette wouldn't be able to keep up with me, but she didn't say anything about being tired until morning. We had passed through many sleepy villages, and the road markers told us that we were five leagues from Blois. There was a yellow glow in the sky ahead of us: the cocks that had woken up were calling from one henhouse to another; in the houses, we were beginning to see lights behind the shutters; soon we were passed by horses and carters who, at a slow pace, were on their way to plough.
- Now," said Diélette, "let's rest, I'm not scared any more.
- So you have been afraid?
- I think so, ever since Blois.
- Of what?
- Of silence; I don't like it at night; and then the shadows get longer and shorter, it makes you gallop and stops your heart.
The day dawned while we were having lunch with my scabs: a grey, damp day; it showed us a great bare plain as far as the eye could see, where, in clumps of trees, stood houses, above which gently rose columns of yellow smoke. Freshly-turned soil followed furrows of thatch; nowhere was there any green to be seen. Flocks of crows flew heavily across the sky, dividing into small flocks to swoop down on the ploughs and harrows that were working the fields here and there.
We soon set off again and covered two more leagues, but then our fatigue began to weigh us down. Diélette was falling asleep. She was so tired that she slept for five hours without waking up.
My great worry on this journey was how we would spend the night; I had experience of sleeping under the stars, and I was not at ease when I thought of the cold of this season; so, when we resumed our journey, it was decided that, regardless of the distance, long or short, we should not stop until we had found a good, sheltered spot. We met him at the foot of a park wall, where the wind had piled up a large heap of dry leaves. As it was barely four o'clock when we made this discovery, I had plenty of time before dark to prepare our bed.
I gathered several armfuls of dead leaves from the wood, and added them to those against the wall; I packed them well, and above them I leaned branches into the cracks in the stones, which I fixed firmly by pressing them into the earth; this formed a sort of rafters, on which I spread the blanket: we thus had a bed and a roof.
Diélette was very pleased with this construction. It was very funny, a thatched cottage in the woods, it looked like Petit Poucet. Ah! if she'd had any butter, she would have dipped the soup in it, but she didn't have any butter.
However, when, after our dinner, which was like our lunch, made up of crusts, evening began to fall, when the red glow left at sunset faded, when the birds perched in the leafy firs no longer made their cries heard, when the shadows filled the wood, she seemed less reassured.
- Are you sleepy?
- I'm not sleepy.
- Well, if you want, don't sleep until I'm asleep; I'll be less scared.
We weren't too badly sheltered under our blanket; however, through the many holes we could see the stars shining in the sky, and although everything in nature was asleep, we could hear little inexplicable noises that warned us we weren't in a house.
Diélette tossed and turned for quite a while, but finally tiredness got the better of her and she fell asleep. Very happy to be free of my surveillance, I did as she did.
I was right to fear the cold; before morning it woke us up.
- Are you cold?" asked Diélette when she felt me stir; "I'm freezing.
There was nothing we could do, we had exhausted every precaution; we had to go back to sleep and wait for daylight.
I couldn't do that, I was sweating and, despite all my efforts to stop myself, my whole body was shaking. I could also hear a noise around us that worried me; on the ground, the leaves were cracking as if thousands of insects had trampled on them.
- Do you hear?" asked Diélette in a low voice.
Despite my desire to reassure her, there was no way of answering no; and besides, I was beginning to feel a little insecure myself. I wanted to be brave because I had to protect my comrade; alone, I would probably have run away.
For more than half an hour, we remained without daring to move; I could hear Diélette's teeth chattering; our bed of leaves was shaken by our trembling, and outside there was always the same creaking.
This continuity and equality in the noise finally made me feel a little better; if it had been produced by someone or by an animal it would have varied; we had to see.
I lifted the blanket a little: the white light of the moon falling from a starry sky showed me that everything around us was in the same state. Emboldened, I put my hand on the leaves so that I could lean out and see further; the leaves cracked; they were stiff and caught in a compact layer. It was the frost.
This reassured us, but didn't warm us up; on the contrary, knowing that it was freezing made us feel even colder.
Suddenly I heard Diélette get up.
- What's the matter?
- My reseda! my reseda! it's going to freeze and die.
She took him in her arms and hid him under her cloak to keep him warm.
What time was it? Was it morning or only night? The moon had waned, but I didn't know when it would set.
It soon became impossible to stay under our shelter; even though we were crouched down and huddled together, we were shivering so much that we could hardly speak. We decided to set off again; at least by walking we could keep warm.
We had to fold up the camp and load it back onto our backs, but a difficulty arose: Diélette wanted to shelter her reseda, and she found nothing better than to hold it under her coat, which, by paralysing one of her arms, was not very practical. I offered to abandon the plant, but she angrily replied that I had no heart, and I didn't dare insist.
So here we were again, on the main road at night, in the freezing cold. The journey didn't look good, but I didn't dare share my fears with Diélette; she walked bravely and always had something cheerful to say that made me feel better.
After an hour's walk through the countryside, we heard the roosters crowing, and it made us laugh to think that it would soon be daylight. We were warm, and we told each other, mocking each other, about our fears of the night; we argued a little, and finally it was agreed that I was braver than she was, but that she was less stupid than I was.
For fear of being chased on the road to Paris, where Lapolade would be looking for us, if he was looking for us, we took the road from Blois to Chartres; according to my studies of the map, it was only an insignificant diversions.
That evening we passed Châteaudun; it had been a hot day, but the evening cooled off, and we decided to ask to sleep in an inn; it was a considerable expense, but it was better than freezing to death.
- When we run out of money," said Diélette, "I'll sing in the villages, and we'll earn some.
She said this bravely, like a little person so perfectly sure of her business that her confidence passed to me.
But it's not as easy as that to earn money by singing; we soon had to learn that, and also how it's spent.
Two leagues from Châteaudun, they were kind enough to take us in at an inn, and they asked us for forty sous for our night's lodging. Fortunately I had a story prepared on this subject: we were going to Chartres to reserve a place for our caravan, which was following us closely and would be passing the next day or the day after.
Lying didn't suit Diélette or me; it was a useful necessity that humiliated us.
From Châteaudun to Chartres, the road cuts across vast bare plains, where you can only make out a few villages in the middle of the fields from time to time; but there are hardly any houses on the road itself.
When we arrived at Bonneval, which is a large town, we thought we were going to make a fortune; but we were only given three sous; I don't count as generosity a pot of water thrown on our heads by a gentleman who was doing his beard, nor the chase of a dog that a butcher threw at us and which tore Diélette's skirt; not everything is profitable in the profession of singer.
- If I had a wolf," said Diélette, "and you had a flute, we'd make money; it's funny that people only want to give to those who have something.
Diélette had an incredible spirit of patience. She was never irritated by these disappointments, nor by the nastiness.
Luckily, in the evening we didn't have to pay for an inn: we were received in a farmhouse and put to sleep in a sheepfold, where the sheep kept up a good heat, which made that night the best of our journey. The next day, as we were leaving, the farmer's wife was getting into the carriage to go to the Chartres market; she took pity on Diélette's tired look and offered her a seat; but Diélette refused, looking at me so expressively that the farmer's wife, understanding that she didn't want to be well when I was ill, made us both get in.
Sleeping like this, sometimes in a farmhouse, sometimes in a brickyard, sometimes in an inn, we arrived, walking every day as much as we could, at a small hamlet after Bièvre, which is only three leagues from Paris.
It was time; we only had eleven sous left; Diélette's shoes were in tatters; she had a skinned foot, which made her suffer terribly every time we set off again after a rest, and we were so tired that we lifted our legs as if we had been dragging lead soles.
But she didn't complain, and every morning she was the first to set off.
Our eleven sous did not allow us to sleep in an inn, but we were lucky enough to meet a quarryman in Saclay with whom we travelled, and who gave us shelter in his stable.
- We have to leave early tomorrow," said Diélette, "it's Sainte-Eugénie and I want to arrive in time to wish Mum a happy birthday; I'll give her my reseda.
Poor reseda! it was quite bare, shredded and yellowed, but it was still more or less alive, and a few more lively sprigs testified to what it had once been.
We left as soon as the quarryman had fixed his horses, which was early in the morning.
The weather had so far been miraculously favourable, cold at night and fine during the day; but when we left the stables, it seemed to us that the cold had become more intense. However, the sky was overcast; there was not a single star in sight, and on the eastern side, instead of the beautiful red and copper hues to which we had become accustomed since the beginning of our journey, there were heavy grey clouds. There was also a northerly wind that tore up and carried away the dead leaves. Sometimes they came at us in such a hurry that they seemed to want to block our path. Diélette struggled to keep her cape on the reseda. The day dawned, but it was dark and livid.
- The sun is resting, so much the better: it won't shine on our rags," said Diélette, who found consolation in everything.
- Don't worry, the sky will wash them before Paris.
I thought it was going to rain, but it turned out to be snow. At first it fell in little butterflies, carried along by the wind; then these butterflies soon grew and became a tight, compact swarm. The wind whipped them around our faces so hard that they blinded us.
We had gone barely a league. The woods on either side bordered the road; we had to seek shelter there, because nowhere in the distance could we see a house, and despite our haste to get to Paris, it was impossible to walk against this snowy storm.
Ditch embankments, topped with bower bushes still with their dried leaves on the branches, cut through the woods here and there; we huddled at the foot of one of these embankments. It protected us for quite a long time, but the snow, carried along by the gusts, skimmed the earth like a cloud of white dust and only stopped when it encountered an obstacle: soon it overtook the crest of the embankment and fell on the side where we were leaning; it swirled over our heads and slid down our necks, where it melted. I tried to use the blanket to protect us, but the wind soon blew it away.
Our clothes were nothing but rags: they did little to protect us from the cold. She hugged me, but I was too cold myself to warm her. I was wetter than if I'd thrown myself in the river.
I had to stay in this position for two hours without the wind letting up. The snow didn't seem to fall from the sky; it flew horizontally, as fast as thousands of white arrows; sometimes it stirred and swirled back up again.
Diélette, however, had not abandoned her reseda; she held it close to her, sheltered under her cape; but the snow, which slipped through her clothes, penetrated everywhere; when she saw that it had piled up on the earth in the pot, where it didn't melt, she wanted to give it to me.
- What do you want me to do with it?
- Please try to save it for me.
It made me angry to see her going to so much trouble over this plant. I shrugged my shoulders and showed her her fingers, stiffened by the pot.
- Ah!" she said angrily, "why didn't you tell me to throw it away straight away?
We were in a situation where quarrels are quick to erupt; we exchanged a few angry words, the first between us, then, both of us remaining silent, we began to stare straight ahead at the falling snow.
But soon I felt his hand reaching for mine.
- Do you want me to throw it away?
- You can see it's dead, its leaves are black and limp.
She said nothing, but I saw tears welling up in her eyes.
- Oh, Mum," she said, "I won't be taking him anything.
- Let's keep it," I said, and took the pot.
The snow was still falling, but the wind died down; gradually it stopped altogether, and then the snow began to thicken into large flakes; in a few moments the ground was covered with a thick white sheet that came up to our legs as if the snow wanted to bury us slowly in this icy shroud.
This went on for over an hour. The trees were bending under the weight of the snow. On our blanket, which protected us as best we could, we felt a weight of several pounds. The cold had paralysed us, and I don't think either of us was fully aware of the danger of our position.
Finally the snowflakes became smaller and lighter, and we stopped. The sky was slate black; it was the white earth that lit it up.
- Let's walk," said Diélette.
We returned to the main road: we were halfway through the snow; as far as we could see, there were neither cars on the road nor peasants on the plain; the only living creatures to be found in this desert were magpies which, perched on the trees in the ditches, seemed, by their cries, to be mocking us as we passed in front of them.
After passing through a village, we came to the top of a hill, and saw a cloud of smoke hovering over an immense city, spread out confusedly between two white hills; a confused hum, something like the murmur of the sea reached us.
- It's Paris," said Diélette.
We felt less cold and less exhausted.
On the road we could see cars heading towards the city. But we hadn't arrived yet; when we got down to the plain and could no longer see that longed-for goal in front of us, weariness and exhaustion returned.
We were slipping with every step and making little headway; our wet clothes were smoking on our bodies.
The snow on the road became less white, and then it was just black mud: the cars we passed or which overtook us followed each other in a continuous parade; house followed house, and in the fields you could see here and there big black wheels with piles of stones around them. Despite her energy, Diélette was forced to stop; the sweat was pouring from her forehead and she was limping badly. I swept the snow off a bench by the door of a house, and she sat down.
- Ask yourself if we're going to be here much longer," she said as a cart driver passed by.
- Where are you going?" he said when I asked him this question.
- To the market.
- Well, you'll be at least an hour and a half, very much so.
- I'll never be able to," she said on hearing this answer.
She was livid, her eyes were dark, she was panting painfully.
I had to get her up, she wanted to stay on the bench, where the cold had already seized us: I told her about her mother, and she regained her courage. We were about to arrive, we didn't need all our luggage any more, so I left it on the bench and told her to lean on me.
We set off again.
- You'll see how Mummy will kiss you," she said, "and then some good broth and cakes; first I'll stay in bed for eight days without getting up.
At the barrier, I asked for directions to the market. We were told to go straight to the river. The streets of Paris were even dirtier and more slippery than the main road: people stopped to watch us go by; in the middle of the crowd and the cars, bewildered, wet, dirty and dressed in clothes, we must have looked like two lost birds; Diélette had regained her strength through hope, and we were still moving quite fast.
When we reached the Seine, we were sent to Pont-Neuf, and going straight on we came upon Saint-Eustache.
When we saw the golden clock face, I felt Diélette shiver against me.
- The clock," she said, "there's the clock.
It was only a flash of joy.
- It is the clock, but I can't find the houses.
We went round the church.
- We've made a mistake; it's not Saint-Eustache," she said.
I asked again where we were and was told:
- At Saint-Eustache.
Diélette's eyes wandered: she could no longer speak, she was stammering.
- I said to her, 'Let's look in all the streets that lead to the clock.
She let me lead her, but she no longer had the enthusiasm that had shaken her tiredness when she arrived.
She didn't recognise any of the streets.
Opposite the church there was a large area of land where houses had been demolished and workmen were at work.
- It was there," she said, bursting into tears, "there!
- Let's ask.
- I don't know the name of the street, I don't know Mum's name, but I would have recognised the house so well!
Stronger men than us wouldn't have withstood the blow. So much fatigue, so many trials, such firm hope! We stood against the church, looking at each other, dazed and frightened, and the crowd, compact in this place, elbowed us and pushed us; there were passers-by who stopped to examine curiously these two poor little bundles of rags that made such a strange figure there.
My hopes were less shattered and I was less exhausted than Diélette, but I regained my sense of humour and, taking her by the arm, I led her into a large covered building where vegetables of all kinds were piled up. There were some empty baskets in one corner; I made her sit on one of them; she let herself be led around like an idiot. I couldn't think of anything to say to her, her lips were like a drop of blood and she was shaking all over.
- Are you in pain?
- Oh, Mummy," she said, and although she wasn't actually crying, big tears fixed themselves in the corners of her eyes.
All around us, there was a constant bustle of people shouting, arguing, selling, buying, bringing, taking away - the hubbub, the tumult, the activity of the Halle.
It wasn't long before people were milling around us: seeing these two children so miserable in their clothes, so pale, so tired, one of them crying incessantly, aroused curiosity.
- What are you doing here?" asked a fat woman.
- We're resting.
- You don't rest here.
Without replying, I took Diélette by the hand to make her get up and go: where? I didn't know. But she looked at me with an expression of weariness and despondency so eloquent that the fat woman felt pity.
- You can see she's too tired," she said. "Aren't you ashamed to make her walk?
Question after question led me to tell her why we were there, that we had come a long way to find Diélette's mother, and that the house had been demolished.
- That's quite a story!" she said when I'd finished explaining; and she called other women, who came to surround us.
- So you don't know her mother's name or the name of the street?" said one of the women when I had resumed my story. "Tell me, do you know this: a linen maid who lived in one of the demolished streets?
There was a confusion of questions, answers and explanations, but nothing definite came of it. The streets had long since been demolished; there were hundreds of linen maids; which one was Diélette's mother? where did she live? where could they look for her? Chaos.
During all this talk, Diélette had paled even more; her trembling had increased; you could hear her teeth chattering.
- You can see that this little girl is frozen," said one of the women.
She ushered us into her shop, where two or three women followed us, while the others went back to their stalls and chatted.
She wasn't content with the heater, she had two cups of broth brought in, and when she had warmed and comforted us, she put twenty sous in my hand.
That was a lot for her, but so little for us in our terrible situation! Where to go? What to do now? As far as I was concerned, all I had to do was continue on my way to Le Havre; but Diélette? She herself felt the extremity of her situation, for when we met in the street, her first words were:
- Where are we going?
The church was in front of us; the snow, which was beginning to flutter again in the icy air, made the street uninhabitable.
- There," I said, pointing to the church door.
We entered; a warm atmosphere enveloped us; the church was silent, with only a few people kneeling in the chapels. We took refuge in the darkest chapel.
- My God! my God!" murmured Diélette.
- Listen," I said in a low voice, "since you can't find your mother, you'll have to find mine.
- To Port-Dieu?
- Yes; you don't want to go back to Lapolade, do you? You've had enough of the bank; well, you'll have to go to Mum. You'll work with her, she'll teach you her trade; when I come back from sea, I'll find you both. You'll see that Mum will like you. And then, if you're with her, I'll be quieter, she'll be less bored; if she's ill, you'll look after her.
Diélette was frankness itself; she accepted with a joy that, better than any words, showed how keenly she felt the horror of her position. She had only one objection:
- Your mother won't want me.
- Why won't she?
- Because I used to be an acrobat.
- Well, I used to be one too.
- It's not the same for you," she said sadly.
It was a lot to know where to go, but it wasn't just a goal, we had to get there. The future seemed assured, but the present!
I didn't really realise how far it was from Paris to Port-Dieu, all I know is that it was a long way.
When I left what we were carrying at Montrouge, like a ship that throws its cargo into the sea to lighten its load and avoid sinking low, I had fortunately kept my road map. I pulled it out of my pocket, unfolded it on a chair and began to study it.
That was the main thing for the moment; later I would study the rest of the route.
But how could we do this route when we had no shoes on our feet, no clothes on our bodies and only twenty sous in our pockets? How could we undertake it in the tired state we were in, especially with Diélette, who seemed ready to collapse at any moment? All of a sudden she would turn pale, and all of a sudden she would blush too; the shivers wouldn't leave her. How could we risk spending the night out in this cold and snow, when in the morning, in broad daylight, we had so narrowly escaped death?
- Will you be able to make it?" I said to Diélette.
- I don't know; when I came here, I saw my mum and that gave me heart, but I can't see yours.
- What are you doing here?" said a voice behind us.
The map was spread out on the chair; it was quite clear that we weren't using it as a prayer book.
- Come on, quickly, get out.
We had to obey and walk in front of the Swiss, who was grumbling through his teeth.
The snow wasn't falling, but the wind was blowing; it was icy cold.
We returned to the street we had come from. Diélette could barely drag herself along: as for me, recovered from the broth I had swallowed, excited above all by worry, I didn't feel too tired.
We hadn't walked ten minutes when she stopped.
- I can't go on," she said; "you can see how I'm shaking; my heart's pounding, my chest hurts, I think I'm ill.
She wanted to sit down on a bollard, but after a few minutes' rest, she got up again.
When we reached the Seine, we turned right; as far as the eye could see, the quays were covered in snow, and the whiteness of the snow made the water of the river almost black; passers-by, wrapped in their coats, walked quickly, and children slipped on the deserted pavements.
- Is it far?" asked Diélette.
-- What?
- Where we're going to sleep.
- I don't know; let's keep walking.
- But I can't walk any more; here, Romain, leave me here, let me die, take me to a corner.
I took her by the arm: I wanted to get out of Paris; it seemed to me that in the countryside we might find a brickyard, an abandoned house, an inn, a refuge, whereas in the streets full of people, where everyone was hurrying past, where there were town sergeants who looked at you so harshly, I felt lost.
We walked for nearly a quarter of an hour more, but without going any further, which meant that, although we were no longer in the middle of the houses, we found ourselves caught between a parapet on one side and a huge wall on the other, the end of which we couldn't see; above this wall there were trees powdered with snow and soldiers standing guard. Diélette could no longer support herself, so to tell the truth, I was carrying her; despite the cold, sweat was pouring from my forehead, as much from fatigue as from worry. I could feel that she was at the end of her tether, that she was ill. What was to become of us?
Diélette let go of my arm and sat down, or rather collapsed, on the pavement in the snow.
- It's over," she said weakly.
I sat down beside her and tried to make her understand that we had to walk some more. Only her hands seemed to be alive, burning like coals.
After a few minutes, I began to feel afraid; no one was passing by; I got up to look into the distance; nothing but those two lines of stone and white snow in the middle. I begged her, begged her to get up; she didn't answer me. I wanted to carry her, she let me; but after a few steps, I was obliged to rest: I couldn't. She slipped to the ground and fell to the ground.
She slid to the ground. I sat down beside her. It was over; we had to die there. No doubt, in her despondency, she was aware of our position, because she leaned against me and gently kissed me with her icy, trembling lips. This brought tears to my eyes and my heart sank.
I hoped, however, that her strength would return and we could continue, but she didn't make a move; her eyes closed, she let herself lie against me; if she hadn't been shaken by a jerky tremor, I would have thought she was dead.
Two or three passers-by, surprised to see us thus slumped in the snow, stopped indecisively to look at us, then continued on their way.
I had to take a decision, and I decided to ask for help from the first person who came along. It was a town sergeant, and he called out to me and asked why we were staying there. I told him that my little sister was ill and could no longer walk.
There were questions and questions. When I told him (this was the story I'd prepared) that we were going to my parents' house in Port-Dieu, a long way by the sea, and that we'd been walking for ten days, he opened his eyes wide.
- Come on," he said, "this child is going to die here; we have to get to the station.
But Diélette, getting weaker and weaker, couldn't get up; she hadn't been able to walk when I asked her to, nor would she walk when the town sergeant ordered her to.
So he took her in his arms and told me to follow him. We set off. After five minutes, he was joined by one of his comrades, to whom he told what I had told him; he took Diélette in his turn, and soon we arrived at a house with a red lantern hanging from the door. In a large room, around a snoring stove, were several town sergeants.
As Diélette couldn't answer, they questioned me. I began my story again.
- I do believe she's dead," said one of the police officers.
- No, but she's not much better, we'll have to take her to headquarters.
- And you," the chief asked me, "what are you going to do?
I looked at him without understanding.
- Have you got any money?
- I've got twenty sous.
- Good! try to get away tonight; if you're found in the streets, you'll be arrested.
They put Diélette on a stretcher, rolled her up in blankets, closed the curtains over her and took her away.
I was stunned. I couldn't believe she was so ill: I wanted to know... And the police threatened to arrest me if they met me in the street. Nevertheless, I followed them. I got them to tell me that I could follow them.
After walking for quite a long time and crossing the Seine, they stopped in a square at the end of which stood a big, beautiful church; they let me in with them; a gentleman in a black suit opened the curtains of the stretcher. Diélette was as red as a poppy.
He questioned her gently enough; I stepped forward and answered for her, repeating my story for the third time.
- Well," he said, "a cold, extreme tiredness, it's a chest flux. To Jesus.
He wrote a few words on a piece of paper, and we set off again. On the slippery snow, the porters made difficult progress; when they rested, I approached the stretcher and spoke to Diélette; sometimes she answered me in a sorrowful voice, other times she didn't reply.
This new race lasted even longer than the first. Finally, in a street where there weren't many passers-by, we stopped in front of a green door; then we entered a fairly dark room: men in white aprons approached.
Diélette no doubt understood, as I did, that the moment of separation had come; she drew aside the curtain and, looking at me with her eyes that sparkled:
- Are you abandoning me? she said.
I thought only of Diélette, of her isolation; I saw only her, lying on that wretched stretcher, begging me:
- No," I said.
She barely had time to thank me with a look, but what a look! She was taken away.
I stood there, stupid and shattered, without moving a muscle, when the concierge told me I had to leave.
- Won't I be able to see her?
- Yes, on Sundays and Thursdays.
And the door was pushed open on my heels.
It would soon be dark, and already the lights were on in some of the houses. The first question that arose was where to sleep; as for how to live in Paris while waiting for Diélette to be cured, I would worry about that the next day. I was no longer in the days when I needed a well-defined plan with all the precautions taken; the habit of present misery makes one rather insensitive to things of the future.
I didn't know that in this big city there were thousands of wretches like me who, at this very hour, didn't know where they would sleep and who nevertheless found somewhere to sleep and perhaps to dine. Brought up in the fields, I could only find things that a farmer could afford, a barn, a stable, a haystack; but in the district where I was walking, I saw none of that; houses, walls and then houses!
As I turned right out of the hospice, at the corner of the street I read Rue de Sèvres, and found myself on a wide boulevard planted with tall trees. I didn't know where it led, but I didn't care! Since I had no goal, I might as well take this road as any other. I walked slowly because, exhausted, I could no longer drag myself; my shoeless feet, which had been stuck in the snow since morning, had become as numb as if they were dead. Some children had slipped on the pavement; I stopped mechanically to look at them.
It was a child called Biboche, whom I had seen at Falaise, where he belonged to the Vignali troupe. His hut was next door to Lapolade's and we had played together.
As I was the only spectator, he looked at me and recognised me. He came over to me.
- What are you doing in Paris? Has your lion arrived? I'm going to see Diélette.
I told him I'd left Lapolade, that I'd only been in Paris since the morning, and that I was very embarrassed because I didn't know where to sleep; I didn't mention Diélette, and I ended by asking him if he thought anyone in his troupe would want to hire me.
- Of course they would if you were a good zig; are you a good zig?
I didn't quite realise what qualities you needed to be a good zig; but as I saw a bed, I replied that I thought I had those qualities.
- So put your hand there," said Biboche.
- And the boss?
-- He's a loafer, that kid! It's me who hires you; you're one of our company; I'll teach you to grinch.
I didn't know this new language; no doubt they were Parisian words; I didn't want to seem too surprised, although I was strangely surprised to see Biboche, who wasn't eleven years old and was as big as a ferret, leading the troupe.
- Are you cold?" said Biboche, seeing that I was shivering, "well, come and warm yourself up.
He took me to a wine merchant, where he gave me a glass of mulled wine.
- Now that you're all fixed up, let's go and have supper.
Instead of heading towards the centre of Paris, which was on our right, we turned left and for a long time walked through streets where there were only a few passers-by and where the houses looked dirty and poor.
Biboche saw my surprise.
- Did you think I was offering you hospitality in the Tuileries?
It was not indeed the Tuileries that he led me to, but a plain; night had fallen completely, but with it had not come complete darkness. We left the road and took a path across the fields. At the edge of an excavation, Biboche stopped:
- This is it," he said; "give me your hand and be careful not to fall.
We descended into a kind of quarry; then, after a few detours through sections of rock, we entered an underground gallery: Biboche drew a rat-de-cave from his pocket and lit it; I was more and more astonished.
- Another minute," he said, "and we'll be there.
Indeed, almost immediately I saw a red glow illuminating the quarry; it was a charcoal blaze: a child Biboche's age was lying next to it.
- No one there yet?" asked Biboche.
- He asked.
- Well, here's a friend, try and find him some shoes, he needs them.
The child went away and came back almost immediately with a supply of shoes; it was as if I were in a cobbler's shop.
- Choose," said Biboche, "and if you're used to socks, don't be embarrassed, we'll give you some; all you have to do is ask.
I can't tell you how good it felt when my aching, icy feet were warmed by a pair of good woollen socks and brand new shoes.
I was just finishing putting on my shoes when two more children arrived, then a third, then a fourth, then three more: nine in all.
Biboche introduced me:
- This is a friend of mine from the bank," he said. And the rest of you, come on, what did we do?
Everyone then emptied their pockets around the brazier; one brought a ham, another bottles; there was one who drew from his pocket a small bottle with a silver feeding-bottle.
There was a general exclamation, laughter and mockery.
- It's OK," said Biboche, "he can drink from it.
Everyone sat down by the fire, not on chairs, but simply on the ground.
Biboche did me the honours and I was served first. It had been a long time since I had seen such abundance, and I must say that neither at home nor at Mr de Bihorel's had I ever partaken of such a feast; after the ham came a cold turkey, and after the turkey a pâté of foie gras. I was so hungry that I was much admired by the group.
-- A la bonne heure!" said Biboche, summing up everyone's impression, "it's a pleasure to invite friends who squirm like that.
But the food, the heat and above all the fatigue soon weighed me down.
-- I'm sorry I don't have a stake or a cake to offer you, but you'll sleep well all the same, won't you?
What use would a stake and a wafer be to me in bed? I didn't dare ask; those were probably still distinguished words that aren't used in the provinces.
- A glass of punch," said Biboche, "and good night!
I refused the glass of punch, which seemed to astonish the company, and asked Biboche to tell me where I could go to bed.
- I'll take you there.
Indeed, he lit a candle in the brazier and, passing in front of me, led me into a side gallery of the quarry.
There was a thick layer of straw on the floor and two or three woollen blankets on top.
- Sleep well," he said, "we'll talk tomorrow"; and he left me, taking the candle with him.
I was not too reassured in this quarry, the depths of which my eyes could not fathom; at the same time I was very intrigued to know what my new comrades were; those full pockets, the ham, the bottle, all that seemed suspicious to me. But I was so overwhelmed that tiredness won out over worry; I'd hardly rolled up in my blanket before I fell asleep. "We'll put up tomorrow", Biboche had said; the next day would be time to explain. I had shelter, I had a good supper; the day had been hard enough not to prolong it; I fell asleep without being disturbed by the shouts of the troops that I could hear drinking and laughing a few steps away from me.
The next day it was Biboche who woke me up, for without him I would probably have slept for twenty-four hours.
-- Here," he said, "here are some clothes, get dressed.
I got rid of my rags and put on the clothes he had thrown on the straw; they consisted of trousers and a jacket made of good, thick, soft wool.
A faint white glow fell from the vault; it was daylight, which filtered down to this depth with difficulty.
- My good fellow," said Biboche as I was getting dressed, "I've been thinking about you and this is what I've come up with. You're not very clever at your job, are you?
- Not really.
-- If you wanted to work like us without an apprenticeship, you'd be in trouble. To prevent that, I'm going to put you with a good boy and you'll be his rat.
Despite my desire not to disgrace myself by showing that I wasn't familiar with the Parisian language, I couldn't let the word go without explanation: since I was to be a raton, I had to know what it was.
- Are you dressed?" said Biboche, seeing that I was looking at him.
- Yes, I'm dressed.
- Well, we're going to have lunch and then I'll take you to my friend.
I followed him; the blaze was out and there was no trace of the previous day's feast. The daylight, a little brighter because we were closer to the opening, showed only two pillars supporting the vault and, here and there, piles of stone.
In a hollow in the wall, Biboche took a bottle, some bread and a scrap of ham.
- Let's break bread," he said, "and have lunch with your new boss.
I summoned up my courage.
-- Don't make fun of me," I said, "you know I'm not from Paris, so explain to me what a raccoon is.
This question made him so cheerful that he almost choked on his laughter.
-- Are they loffes in your country! Well, my good fellow, a raccoon is a brat, in other words a child like you and me, not too heavy and alert. And perhaps you don't know how many merchants close their shops while they're eating in their kitchens?
Although I had no idea what these two ideas had to do with each other, I replied that I did not know how merchants closed their shops.
-- With a little low barrier," continued Biboche, handing me the bottle of wine, which he had half emptied; this barrier is held by a spring which corresponds to a bell; if someone enters, he has to push the barrier, then the bell rings, and the merchant, who is quite quiet in his back shop or in his kitchen, comes to see who is there. Now can you guess what the raccoon is for?
-- Not at all; unless he's in charge of replacing the doorbell.
Biboche fell back into a fit of laughter, which this time actually suffocated him. When he had finished coughing, he gave me a good telling-off:
-- If you say anything like that again," he said, "warn me, you'll get me killed. Instead of replacing the bell, the raccoon is in charge of preventing it from ringing; to do this, it is passed over the barrier, it goes quietly and crawling to the drawer, removes the box, gives it to the man outside; the latter takes it at arm's length, makes it go back over the barrier, and voilà: the merchant is rinsed without knowing it. Does that suit you?
I was stunned.
- But that's stealing!
- Is it?
- So you're a thief?
- Well, are you a fool?
I didn't answer; I thought about what I had seen the day before, and told myself that Biboche was right to call me a fool.
But I had to make up my mind:
- Listen," I said, "if you counted on me for this, you were mistaken.
This time he didn't laugh, but became furious: I had deceived him; if he let me go, I would report him.
- Well, no!" he cried, "you won't tell on me and you won't leave here.
- I will leave.
Before I could say any more, he lunged at me; but if he was more supple and more alert, I was stronger; the struggle was not long: after the first moment of surprise, when he had knocked me down, I got the upper hand, and holding him under me, I said:
- Will you let me go?
- Will you sell me?
- No, I won't.
- Swear it.
- I swear it.
I got to my feet.
- If you hadn't met me yesterday you'd be dead today, and if you're still alive, it's because you ate stolen ham, it's because you drank stolen wine; if your feet aren't frozen, it's because I gave you stolen shoes; if you don't freeze to death when you leave here, it'll be because you have stolen clothes on your back. 
I didn't think about those clothes, which were so good and so warm, because I felt so good in them.
- Will you give me the candle?
- And why would I do that?
- To go and get my old clothes back.
- I'm not reproaching you for those, I'm giving them to you.
- Yes, but I don't want to keep them.
He followed me, shrugging his shoulders, into the gallery where I had spent the night.
When I tried to put on my old shoes, I noticed that one was completely untied.
Biboche looked at me without speaking; I wanted to turn away, because I was ashamed of my misery.
- To be a fool," he said in a gentle voice, "you are one; but what you're doing here, you see, it moves me (he beat his chest); so it's good to feel honest?
- Why don't you try it?
- It's too late.
- If you're arrested, condemned, what will your mother say?
- My mother! Ah! if I had one! Don't talk to me about that!
And as I wanted to interrupt him:
- Since you don't want these clothes because they're stolen, will you accept the ones I had when I worked in Falaise? I earned them well; take them if you have a heart.
I replied that I would accept.
- Fine," he continued with obvious satisfaction, "let's go out together, I'll give them to you.
We returned to Paris, and he took me to a furnished house near the barrier. He took me up to a room and drew from a cupboard a jacket and trousers that I remembered very well having seen him wear in Falaise; he also gave me some shoes, which, though not new, were still good.
- Now, goodbye," he said, when I was dressed; "if you meet your comrades, be careful not to recognise them.
It wasn't yet ten o'clock; I had all day to find a place to sleep for the next night.
The weather was dry; warmly dressed, well shod, with a full stomach, I wasn't too worried about the difficulty, albeit considerable, of finding a place to stay in Paris.
I couldn't go and see Diélette.
I started walking straight ahead; perhaps chance would come to my aid.
But after two hours, I hadn't found anything, hadn't thought of anything, and yet I had passed through the most different districts; I then thought it wiser to help chance myself, and I headed for the Seine. My intention was to go to the Halle; perhaps the good woman who had given me twenty sous could get me work, or at least show me where I could ask for work.
At first she didn't recognise me in Biboche's clothes; then, when I reminded her who I was, she asked me what I had done with my sister. I told her what had happened the day before, and I could see that she was touched: so I told her that I didn't want to abandon Diélette in Paris, that I wanted to wait until she was cured; but to do that I had to work; that I didn't know who to turn to, and that I had thought, I had hoped...
- I'm flattered, you see, that you recognised from my face that I'm not a woman to leave a child to die on the pavement. We're not rich, but we feel it.
She called in two or three of her neighbours, and they held a meeting to find out what I could be used for, which was rather difficult, because at the Halle it's not customary for children to work. Finally, after long discussions, after I had been questioned ten times, and when it was recognised that I could write well, it was unanimously decided that I would be employed as a clerk at the auction, if a place could be found for me there.
All I know is that the next morning, at five o'clock, they installed me behind a desk at the fish auction, and I was given the job of copying small bulletins; nothing was easier; I wrote quickly and legibly; when Madame Berceau came to see if they were satisfied with my work, they told her that it would go very well, and that I could count on thirty sous a day. It wasn't a fortune, but as Madame Berceau gave me a place to sleep in her shop, it was more than I needed for my food.
Diélette had gone into hospital on Monday; I waited impatiently for Thursday, and when I had finished my work at the auction, I headed for the rue de Sèvres. I'd been given a load of oranges at La Halle and my pockets were full; I was worried and arrived before the doors opened. What was she like? Alive or dead?
When I was directed to the Saint-Charles ward, I started to run, but an orderly stopped me and told me that if I made a fuss I would be sent back immediately. I started to tiptoe.
Diélette was alive and better! I'll never forget the look in her eyes when she saw me.
- I knew you'd come," she said, "if you hadn't frozen to death.
She made me tell her how I had lived since we parted. When I had told her about the quarry :
- Good," she said, "good, my brother.
She had never called me her brother.
- Kiss me," she said, showing me her cheek.
When she heard what Mother Berceau had done for me, she said:
- Ah! the good woman," she said, and her eyes filled with tears.
Then it was her turn to answer me. She had been quite ill, unconscious, with fever and delirium; but she was well looked after; there was a sister who was very good to her.
-- Last night, a little girl died there, in the next bed, and when they put her in the chocolate box, I fainted.
Diélette was mistaken in her hope of leaving hospital soon; she had been so badly affected that her convalescence was very long; she stayed at Jésus for more than two months.
During this time, she won the love of those who looked after her, the sister, the doctor and the interns, whom she won over with her kindness. Everyone knew as much about our story as we thought we could tell, and the interest she inspired reflected on me.
Finally, her discharge note was signed, and on handing it to her, the doctor and the sister announced that they had taken steps to ensure that we would not be obliged to return to Port-Dieu on foot. They had found a nursemaid who was willing to take us in his carriage and drive us to Vire: at Vire, the nursemaid would pay for our place in the public carriage as far as Port-Dieu; a collection had been made in the Salle Saint-Charles, and twenty-five francs had been raised, which was more than enough. During those two months, and in preparation for our journey, which I didn't know was going to be so easy, I had saved six or eight sous a day, which made a total of twenty-two francs.
What a difference between our arrival in Paris two months earlier and our departure! The good Madame Berceau wanted to take us to the carriage herself, and she loaded us up with all sorts of provisions.
It's not a very comfortable vehicle, a carriage for nurses: two plank benches lengthways, straw in the middle, that's all; but for us it was admirable.
It was the end of January; the weather wasn't too cold; it was a very pleasant journey: we weren't squeamish, and we got on well with the nannies who were returning to the country, laden with their babies; when they cried too loudly, or when they were being groomed, we got off and walked a little way.
At Vire, the driver packed us into the coach, which took us down a league from Port-Dieu; it was a Sunday; it had been just seven months since I'd left.
We walked a few hundred paces without speaking to each other, because we were both embarrassed. It was Diélette who first broke the awkward silence:
- Let's go more slowly," she said, "I'd like to talk to you.
The ice was broken.
- Here's a letter for you to give to Mum when she comes in.
- Why a letter?" she said softly, "why don't you come with me? Why don't you take me to your mother? How do you know she'll want me? If she sends me away, what will become of me?
- Don't say that, you don't know Mum.
- Yes, I do; but you don't know if she'll forgive me for not keeping you. Will she ever believe that if I had begged you, you would have gone? What! you would have brought me all the way here and you wouldn't have gone into her house to kiss her? That's not natural.
- That's precisely what I explain to her in my letter; I tell her that if I continue on my way without seeing her, it's because I feel that, if I saw her, I wouldn't leave; so if I didn't leave, I'd have to go back to my uncle. There's a contract, and my uncle isn't a man to give up his rights.
- Your mother might find a way not to let you go back.
- If my mother resisted my uncle, it would be she who would pay for me; whereas, if I'm taken on board, he won't be able to do anything against her, and, when I come back, he won't be able to do anything against me either, because a registered sailor belongs to the government, and the government is stronger than my uncle. I've thought about all that, haven't I?
- I don't know, I don't know all these government affairs, but I have a good feeling that what you're doing here is wrong...
My conscience wasn't strong enough to hear without anger this word that I had said to myself so many times.
- Is it wrong?
- Yes, it's wrong, and if your mother accuses you, if she says you don't love her, I won't be able to defend you, because I'll think like her.
I walked by Diélette for a while without answering; I was moved, shaken, very close to giving in, but I stiffened.
- Have I been unkind to you?
- No, never.
- Do you think I could be unkind to others?
She looked at me.
- Answer me.
- No," she said.
- Do you think I don't love Mum? Do you think I want to make her suffer?
She hoped she'd beaten me, but when she saw that I was defending myself, she didn't answer:
- Well, if you're at all grateful to me, if you think I'm not being unkind, don't talk to me like that again; you might make me decide to stay, and that would be unfortunate for all of us.
She didn't add a single word and we walked side by side in silence, both moved and troubled.
I had taken a path across the moor, where I was almost certain I would meet no one; in this way we came to the ditch that formed the boundary of our courtyard. I had heard the church bell ring; my mother must have gone home.
- This is it," I said to Diélette, pointing over the gorse to the house where I had lived and loved so much.
She sensed my emotion by the tremor in my voice.
- Romain!" she said.
But I pretended not to understand the pleading in that one word.
- When you come in, hand the letter to Mum and say, 'Here's a letter from your son'; you'll see, when she's read it, that she won't reject you. I'll be back in six months. I'll write to you from Le Havre. Farewell.
I wanted to run away, but she threw herself at me.
- Don't hold me back, leave me alone, you can see you're making me cry.
She loosened her hands.
- Don't you want me to kiss her for you?
I had already taken a few steps backwards; I came back, and putting my arm around her, I kissed her; I felt her tears running down my cheeks.
If I didn't run away, I certainly wouldn't leave. I got out of the way and, without looking back, started to run.
But at the end of the path I stopped and crawled back into the gorse. Diélette, having gone down the courtyard, entered the house.
She stayed there for a long time; I couldn't see or hear anything, I was strangled with worry; what if Mum wasn't there any more, what if, like Diélette's mother, she was...?
Just as this sinister thought was entering my mind, Diélette appeared on the threshold; then, almost immediately, behind her, my mother.
She was alive, Diélette was beside her, her hand in her hand; both of them had red eyes. I threw myself down the ditch. Three hours later I climbed under the tarpaulin of the stagecoach and, in two days, via Caen and Honfleur, I reached Le Havre. I had seven francs left in my purse.
XII
I had thought that all I had to do was go on board a ship and I would be hired straight away.
In the Bassin du Roi I saw only four or five steamers, which was not my business; in the Bassin de la Barre I found large American ships from which bales of cotton were being unloaded, which piled up in mountains on the quay; this was still not what I needed; I wanted a French ship.
As I walked around the Bassin du Commerce, I was amazed; there were ships from all over the world, large and small, a forest of masts adorned with guidons, flames and flags. It seemed to me more beautiful than Paris.
Some ships smelt of brown sugar, making my mouth water; others smelt of pepper and cinnamon. Everywhere people were busy loading and unloading cargo; customs officers were watching coffee bales roll by and listening melancholically to the songs of the sailors.
Among these ships there was one that immediately caught my eye; it was painted white with an azure scroll; it was a small three-master; on a board hanging from the shrouds we read: "Loaded for Pernambuco and Bahia, the Morning Star, Captain Frigard, will be leaving shortly". What better way to enjoy a beautiful voyage than on a white and blue ship? Pernambuco and Bahia, are there two more attractive names in geography?
I climbed aboard; the crew and the ship's workers were busy loading; heavy crates were being lowered into the hold, which was wide open, swinging at the end of chains. They didn't pay any attention to me at first, but as I didn't move from my place, not daring to get too close to a gentleman who was registering the crates as they passed in front of him, and who seemed to me to be the captain, I ended up attracting attention.
- Go away!" this gentleman shouted at me.
- Sir, I'd like to talk to you.
And I told him what I wanted, that I wanted to be a cabin boy on board the Morning Star.
He didn't even reply, and with a gesture merely showed me the deck where I had entered.
- But, sir...
He raised his hand; I didn't insist and left the restaurant feeling very humiliated and, to tell the truth, a little worried too.
Wouldn't they want me?
I wasn't in a position to be easily put off. This time I chose a black and dirty brig bound for Tampico, called the Congre. I was simply told that no one was needed. In a third case, instead of asking a captain, I asked a sailor; when I made my request, he shrugged his shoulders, and all I could get out of him was that I was a strange little fellow. Finally, on a schooner bound for the coast of Africa, the captain, whose face was not at all reassuring, was willing to accept me; but when he learned that I had no father to sign my enlistment, no registration with the navy, no bag for my trousseau, and above all no trousseau, he urged me to leave faster than I had entered, if I did not want to make the acquaintance of his boots.
It was an unpleasant situation and I was beginning to feel uneasy. Would I have to go back to Port-Dieu? If I had been able to think only of my mother and Diélette, this necessity would have been all joy; but my uncle, and the commitments that bound me to him... could I forget them? So I continued my search.
As I circled the basins, I came back to the outer harbour; the sea was beginning to rise, and already a few small fishing boats were setting sail. I went down to the jetty to watch the ships come and go; It had been a long time since I had seen this spectacle, and the movement of the tide, the horizon that my eyes could see, the coming and going of the boats from Caen, Rouen and Honfleur, the departure of the big ships for distant voyages with their farewells, the fluttering handkerchiefs of the passengers, the shouts of the sailors, the creaking of the pulleys and the manoeuvres, the mingling of all those white sails in the roadstead from the coast to the extreme curve of the sea made me forget my preoccupation. 
I had been leaning on the parapet for more than two hours when I felt myself being pulled by the hair. Surprised, I turned round and found myself face to face with one of the musicians in Lapolade's troupe, Hermann.
- Is Lapolade in Le Havre?
I asked this question with such a frightened expression that Hermann took more than a minute to answer, laughing so hard. Finally he recovered a little and told me that he too had left Lapolade to go and see one of his brothers who lived in the Republic of Ecuador. As for Lapolade, I could rest easy with him; he had made a considerable inheritance and had sold his menagerie, or rather the remains of it, for a fortnight after our escape, Mouton, poor Mouton, had died of hunger and grief. After Diélette's departure, he had become both terrible and gloomy. He had stubbornly refused all food. It seemed that he was only hungry for Lapolade, whom he threw himself at with fury as soon as he saw him. But as Lapolade had not decided to save his lion's life at the expense of his own, the unfortunate Mouton had finally succumbed, a victim of his attachment and loyalty to Diélette.
Hermann asked me if I was finally a sailor; I told him about the difficulties I was having.
He had been in banking long enough to have a fertile mind for expedients.
- If you like," he said, "I'll hire you as if you were my brother.
And the trousseau?
That was an impossibility, Hermann wasn't much richer than I was. His journey to Guayaquil had been paid for in advance by his brother, and we couldn't afford such an expense with our combined resources.
To console me, he took me to dinner and then to the theatre, where one of his compatriots, a musician in the orchestra, gave us two seats. The first play was a comedy entitled Open Warfare, in which characters are brought in a crate.
- That's your business," he said; "at the interval, I'll explain my idea to you.
His idea was to buy a large crate: I'd hide in it; an hour before departure, he'd take it aboard, tightly closed and roped up. When we were off, he would open it, and the captain, unable to disembark me unless he threw me overboard, would be forced to keep me; once under way, it would be up to me to find a way to get myself employed.
It was insane, but it had a certain adventurous twist to it that appealed to me.
The next day, we visited all the second-hand shops in town and, for ten francs, we found a large box with iron straps, which was just my size, as if it had been made to measure. Hermann took it home, where he had given me hospitality, and he drilled several holes in it to allow me to breathe; I placed myself inside, he closed it and I stayed there for two hours perfectly at ease; I could move my arms and legs, and place myself on my side or on my back, when I wanted to change position.
I occupied my time until then visiting this ship, which was called the Orinoco, and writing a long letter to my mother to tell her that I had finally embarked and that I begged her forgiveness for acting against her wishes, but that I hoped it was for the happiness of us all; To this letter I enclosed one for Diélette; I had to tell her everything I had learnt from Hermann; I also had to recommend that she be very gentle with Mum. 
Two hours before high tide, that is to say at midday, Hermann took me into the cashier's office and gave me a piece of bread:
- If you're too hungry, you can eat.
I had to stay in that box for twenty hours, as we had considered that in the vicinity of Le Havre we were exposed, if I showed up too early, to the risk of the captain landing me on a fishing boat or a pilot boat, whereas out at sea the danger of an encounter was much less to be feared. For several days the southerly winds had been blowing quite strongly; in twenty hours we should have been well beyond Cherbourg, in the middle of the English Channel.
We had fastened two leather handles to the inside of the boat, and I put my arms through them so as not to be tossed about in the jolts of transport. Hermann locked the two locks, made several turns on the rope and loaded me onto his back. He laughed so hard that I was shaken as if on a horse.
When he arrived on board the Orinoco, this merriment was suddenly cut short.
- What have you got there?" shouted the captain.
- My trunk.
- It's too late: the hatches are closed.
It was this closing that we had counted on, because with the hatches open I was lowered into the hold, other crates were piled on top of mine and I was in my box until Guayaquil; while with the hatches closed, I was deposited on deck or in Hermann's cabin.
But things didn't work out so easily; for a long time the captain refused to accept the box, and I thought I was going to be taken ashore; finally I was lowered into steerage with other boxes that had arrived at the last moment.
- We'll stow it en route," said a sailor.
On the way, I didn't care; I hoped I wouldn't be in the crate for long.
Soon I heard the mooring ropes fall into the water, at the same time the capstan was turned, and over my head sounded the cadenced tread of the sailors hauling the ship out of the dock.
By the sounds of the manoeuvre I could follow her in my box, as if with my own eyes I had seen her on deck.
When I heard the rolling of cars and the confusion of voices, I knew we were in the lock. The ship remained motionless for a few minutes, then I felt that she was being gently dragged forward -- it was the tug that had just picked her up; a slight rocking tilted me back and forth, we were in the outer harbour. The rocking became more noticeable, we were between the piers; the pulleys squeaked, the sails were being hoisted: the ship tilted to one side, the tow fell into the water, the rudder groaned, - we were setting sail.
That was it, my life as a sailor was beginning! This long-awaited moment, which I had bought at the cost of so much toil, and which I thought would give me such great joy, left me sad and worried. It is true that the situation was not conducive to gaiety.
Perhaps on deck, mingling with the sailors, busy with the manoeuvres, seeing the open sea before me and the land and port behind, I would have thrown myself happily into the unknown; locked between the four planks of a trunk, I could not help feeling frightened.
I* *was roused from my sad reflections by three or four little knocks against my box; but as no one was speaking, I didn't dare reply for fear that it might be a sailor; the knocks having resumed in such a way as to make it clear to me that it was Hermann, I in turn knocked with my knife.
This warning calmed my nerves; after all,* * I wasn't abandoned, I only had a few hours to spend in this box; when I got out I'd be on the open sea and the world would be mine.
The wind was fresh and the ship, which was broadside to the waves, was rolling a lot. Used as a child to going fishing and being swung around in boats at anchor, I had never experienced seasickness; I thought I was quite safe from this indisposition; I was very unpleasantly surprised to soon feel my heart in knots.
At first I* *thought that this discomfort was caused by the difficulty I had in breathing; for, in spite of the holes we had taken the precaution of drilling in the planks, it was difficult for the air to penetrate the box, and even more difficult for it to get out, so that it was very hot in there; but my discomfort became clearer. The dizziness and the indefinable feeling of spinning that I experienced when the ship sank into a pitching motion left me in no doubt. This worried me a great deal, as I had seen people suffering from this silly disease bellow their lungs out; what if I were to do the same, and a sailor passing by my box during one of these attacks were to hear me!
I had often heard that the best remedy against this illness was sleep; as it was the only one available to me, I buried my head in my hands and, with all my strength, tried to fall asleep. For quite a long time it was in vain; the bed was not soft. If only I'd taken the precaution of stuffing my prison with a bit of straw! My heart followed the movements of the ship, rising and falling with it, but finally I dozed off.
How long I slept, I don't know, for, with no light penetrating my box, I was plunged into an absolute darkness, which didn't allow me to know whether it was day or night; only, from the silence that reigned over the ship, I understood that it must be night; all I could hear on deck was the regular footsteps of the men on watch, and at intervals the creaking of the rudder. The roll had increased: there was creaking in the masts, whistling and humming in the gear; the heavy pounding of the seas against the planking indicated that the wind was blowing harder.
Either the coolness of the night had made the air in the trunk more breathable, or I had got used to the roll, I no longer felt seasick, and soon went back to sleep, lulled by the low music that brought me back to my little room in my father's house during the nights of heavy weather.
This time I was awakened by a frightful crash, a cracking, a tearing of the whole ship, followed immediately by a collapse on deck as if the whole mast were collapsing; the ropes snapped with a noise like detonation, the masts burst.
- Stop!" shouted a voice in English.
- All hands on deck," shouted a voice in French.
Amid the confusion of shouts and noises came a hoarse roar that I recognised at once; it was the exhaust of steam. We must have been boarded by an English steamer which had thrown itself on top of us, and our ship had fallen on its side, because I had rolled against one of the sides of the trunk.
Before I had recovered from my shock, the roar of the steamer ceased, there was a new crack, and a tremendous clamour arose from our side; almost immediately our ship rose again; had the English steamer sunk low, or had it gone away?
I cried out in despair for a crewman to come and rescue me, and I listened: on deck, a murmur of voices and hurried footsteps coming and going on all sides; against the ship's side, the waves breaking with force; above everything, the roar of the wind blowing like a storm.
Were we going to sink? Was Hermann going to leave me in this box? I can't tell you what horrible feeling of anguish gripped my heart. My blood stopped, my hands became wet with sweat as if they had been dipped in water. Instinctively I wanted to get up, but my head hit the lid of the trunk. I knelt down to push with all my strength; the two locks were solid, the lid was grouted and assembled with oak crosspieces; nothing moved. I fell back dead with fear and horror.
After a few moments, I began to shout again and to call out for Hermann, but a loud noise arose on deck, which prevented me from hearing my own voice; the masts were being cut with axes.
And Hermann didn't come to rescue me; what was he doing?
At the same time as the men were clearing the mast, others were working on the pumps, and I could hear the regular ticking of the pendulum.
We were sinking; I rushed desperately against the cover; it was not shaken and I fell back, devastated by my powerlessness, mad with rage and fear.
- Hermann! Hermann!
Still the same noises above my head, i.e. on the deck, but nothing on the side where I was locked in. My voice was lost in this box. And if a few cries erupted outside, they were muffled, carried away by the powerful blast of the storm.
Had Hermann fallen into the sea? had he been swept away by a wave? had he been crushed by a mast? or would he be thinking of his own salvation and not of mine? So I was going to drown in this box!
And no rescue to look forward to?
When you are free, at least you can defend yourself, and the struggle sustains you; but locked up as I was between four planks, barely able to lift myself and breathe, that seemed to me both miserable and monstrous!
I threw myself furiously against the walls of my prison; they held firm and did not even bend. I wanted to scream again, but my parched throat wouldn't let out a sound. I don't know how a man could have endured such a situation; I was only a child and I fainted.
When I came to, after how long I don't know, I had a strange sensation; it seemed to me that I was dead and at the bottom of the water, being tossed about by the eddy. But the noise from the bridge brought me back to reality. They were still pumping, and at times I could hear the sinister gurgling of the water in the valves. The wind was howling in the ship, and the waves were striking against her with dull blows that shook her; she was rolling so frightfully that I was sometimes hitting the right side, sometimes the left side of my body. I started screaming again, stopping from time to time to listen: nothing but the deafening tumult of the storm.
I was suffocating and my clothes were coming off. When I took off my waistcoat, one of my hands met my knife, which I had forgotten: it was a sturdy peasant knife with a horn handle and a strong, sharp blade.
Since no one was coming to help me, it was up to me to help myself.
I opened my knife and attacked one of the locks on the trunk, not to blow it open - I would have broken my knife - but by cutting into the wood around it. The wood was beech dried out by twenty or thirty years of service, it was as hard as iron and my knife could hardly cut into it.
The knife slipped through my fingers and I had to wipe my hands every now and then.
I wasn't making much progress, because the rolling and pitching made me lose my grip every moment; the moment I pressed my knife hardest, I was thrown against the opposite wall.
At last the lock was shaken and I counted on a jolt to loosen it completely. I attacked the second one, but my knife had become so hot that I burnt my tongue cooling the tip in my mouth.
There was no more pumping, but the movement on deck had not stopped; the footsteps were more hurried; they were obviously working hard. At what? I couldn't guess.
There were muffled rumblings as if something very heavy were being * * dragged along, a large box, a boat. Why was this? What did it mean?
I didn't have the time to look for it, nor the time to listen; I went back to work.
My knife was no longer cutting, and I was even less able to cut into the wood around this second lock than around the first. Nevertheless, I put all my strength and energy into it; but at times my arm went numb, my back was broken by the awkward position in which I was standing, and I was forced to stop for a while.
Then I could hear the blast of the hurricane, the crash of the waves, the groaning of the ship as it creaked.
My work certainly lasted more than half an hour. How long it seemed to me, you can't imagine. Finally the second lock, like the first, was shaken.
I got down on my knees and, leaning on my hands, pushed with my back with all my strength against the lid to make it jump: the two locks came off, but the lid didn't open.
It was firmly attached at each end by a rope, which I had forgotten.
Now I had to cut the rope. At first I thought it would be very easy, but I was wrong, because the lid, although it lifted a little, didn't come out of the rabbet, and I had to remove the rabbet before I could get to the rope. It was a new job to undertake.
I wasn't discouraged and set to work straight away: fortunately I was now cutting into the wood grain. Finally I got to the ropes, cut them, and I was free.
I pushed the lid hard, it lifted a little and fell back; I pushed it harder, but it didn't open any more.
My anguish was so cruel that I let myself fall back to the bottom of the trunk, devastated.
But I had done too much not to fight to the end. The lid opened wide enough for me to put my hand through, and when I reached that height, it stopped without anything being able to shake it. I put my hand through the opening and felt around, because it was dark and all I could see was a faint, almost insensitive white glow.
By dint of feeling and searching, I realised what I was up against: it was a big, enormous box! Placed on top of another, it was half covered, and although it wasn't pressed down absolutely, it didn't let the lid work. I tried to push it; it was too heavy, it didn't move; besides, in the position I was in, I had no strength; my arm couldn't extend, so to speak; to try to lift it or even to disturb it was madness.
I had only gone to so much trouble to get to this point; what could I do now? I was trembling with impatience and anguish, and it seemed to me that my blood was boiling in my head like in a furnace.
Perhaps it was the trunk that had muffled my voice; now that I could open the door, they would hear me.
I cried out in despair. Then I listened. There was a great commotion on deck and it seemed to me that something was falling overboard. If I could hear them, they must hear me too. I shouted again. Listening again, I heard no more rolling, no more footsteps, nothing but the roar of the wind; but strangely enough, it seemed to me that cries were coming from the sea against the planking where my box was leaning.
I was definitely not going to be heard. I resolved to dismantle the hinges of the lid; by this means, if I succeeded, I would not need to open it, I would only have to slide it open to be free.
I set to work with even greater haste; the silence frightened me horribly; had the crew been taken out to sea? It was possible, because the violent rolling and pitching and the howling of the wind told me that we were in the middle of a storm.
The hinges weren't as strong as the locks, so I didn't need to cut into the wood; I should have started there and not with the locks, which were only nailed down; with the tip of my knife I managed to detach one of them, and when I'd done that, shaking the lid vigorously, I knocked the nails out of the other.
I pushed the lid, and it slid free. I jumped out of that horrible prison. With what joy I found myself free to move at last! To die in that box would have been to die ten times over!
This relative success had almost given me hope. But my trials were not yet over. Guided by a trickle of light, I groped my way towards the staircase; the bonnet was down, fortunately it wasn't closed, so I pushed it open and found myself on deck.
It was barely daylight, but my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness in my crate; with one glance I took in the whole deck, but I saw no one; no one at the helm either. The ship had been abandoned by the crew.
I jumped onto the poop, and looking into the distance, I saw in the pale morning light a black spot on the sea; it was the big longboat.
I shouted as loud as I could, but the boat was much too far away and the gust of wind was much too violent for my feeble voice to be heard.
I was alone on this ship abandoned in the middle of the sea, helpless, sinking low; and yet such had been my anguish in this wretched trunk, that I felt less terrified.
Looking around me, I saw that the Orinoco had been tackled abeam in the middle of the hull; it was a miracle that she had not been cut in two; but the English steamer had struck her obliquely; In the process it had broken the shrouds of the mainmast and the mizzenmast, and these two masts, not being supported precisely on the side from which the wind came to load the sails, had shattered like matchsticks; all that remained of the masting was half the foremast and the bowsprit intact; all that was left of the sails was the jib and the main topsail, torn to shreds. 
Day was breaking: to the east, the clouds were illuminated by a tawny, fleeting glow, changing like lightning and quickly lost in the black sky. The sea was white with foam as far as the eye could see and, in this pale light, it had a sinister appearance; the wind blowing like a storm flattened the waves.
The crew had abandoned the ship because it was in danger; it didn't take long to work that out.
Left to the whim of the wind and the waves, with no rudder and no sails, she was rolling terribly, and the waves were pounding against the hull as if they were going to sink it. In order to stand up on deck, I had to hold on to a manoeuvre and I was already as wet as if I had fallen into the water.
I wanted to see exactly what damage had resulted from the collision, and I saw that the whole side of the ship was torn. Did this tear extend below the waterline? How much water was in the hold? I couldn't find out either, as I couldn't operate the pumps, which were too heavy for me.
How much longer could the Orinoco, in this state, withstand the wind and the sea? That was the question.
There was no doubt in my mind that she would sink low, but perhaps she wouldn't sink immediately; a ship might see her and save me. I did not lose all hope and, thinking that it was by fighting that I had been able to get out of my horrible box, I resolved to fight again and not give up.
I had enough knowledge of marine affairs to know that if the ship remained without direction, she would soon break up or sink in a gale. So I had to take the helm and, without worrying about direction, try to take advantage of the jib to lean the ship against the waves.
But I had never steered anything but small boats; no sooner had I taken the wheel of this big ship than a gust of sea gave her an irresistible turning movement that made me let go and sent me falling four or five paces.
Fortunately everything on board had been prepared to withstand this storm: the tiller was rigged with its hoists, which meant I could steer without danger; as I had no direction to follow, since I didn't know where I was, I attached the tiller so as to simply have the wind astern.
My great hope was that I would come across a ship, so I did my best to get on the dock so that I could look out to sea and see all points of the horizon.
It seemed to me that the wind was less violent, the day had dawned and the sky was less full of clouds; there were little holes where pale blue gleams were visible; and, although the sea was still as stormy as ever, hope returned to me. So close to the coast, it was impossible for a ship not to appear.
For at least three hours, I stared at the horizon without seeing anything. The wind dropped noticeably; the sea became calmer, meaning that the waves, no longer colliding in disorderly confusion, took on a breadth that tired the ship much less, giving it time to rise and fall.
Suddenly I seemed to see a white dot against the black background of a large cloud trailing in the sea. The dot got bigger, it was a ship; it got bigger still; it was sailing downwind, in other words in the same direction as the Orinoco.
I rushed to the helm to steer in such a way as to cut her off, but while she had all her big sails out, I had only one small one, which offered almost no leeway to the wind.
For half an hour, I saw her grow to the point where I could count her sails, then it seemed to me that she was diminishing.
I ran to the bell, rang it furiously, then jumped onto the rail and looked. It had grown even smaller, and was still going! Decidedly he had neither seen nor heard me...
It was a cruel disappointment: for an hour, I followed him with my eyes; he diminished, diminished, became a dot, became nothing; and I found myself alone in the immensity.
It wasn't enough for ships to pass by, they had to see the Orinoco themselves; it wasn't enough to wait for their help, I had to facilitate it, prepare it, bring it to me.
I took the largest flag I could find from the signal box; then, as the halyards were broken, I climbed up to attach it to the top of the jib mast. It was a tough climb because of the roll, but fortunately I was used to this job and I came back down safely, full of hope in this large flag which was flying in the wind; it would tell those who saw it that there was a ship in distress.
My greatest fear, now that the sea was calming down, was the ingress of water; but there was nothing to indicate that it was increasing; the ship didn't seem to be sinking. However, so as not to leave anything to chance if the Orinoco were to sink beneath me, I gathered together the planks and chests I could find, and tying everything together solidly, I made a sort of raft.
The hours crept towards midday, and since the day before I hadn't eaten; hunger began to speak. The cook's lazarette had been washed out to sea when the ship was dismasted, so I decided to go down to get my food.
But it wasn't without a great deal of hesitation that I made this resolution: what if the ship sank while I was in steerage? Hunger won out over fear.
I went down; I hadn't taken two steps when I heard a growl. I recoiled in horror. With a sudden, violent leap, the animal that had made the growl pushed me aside. It was the captain's dog who had been forgotten. He was getting out of his trunk too, and in his own way. He got to the deck faster than I did. Once there, he turned round and looked at me suspiciously for quite a long time; but no doubt his examination reassured him, for he soon approached me and held out his muzzle. We became good friends straight away; he followed me; like me, he was hungry.
I found everything I could want: bread, cold meat and wine. I grabbed what I could and quickly went back upstairs.
I was two steps from death, but I ate with appetite; the dog, sitting in front of me, ran after the morsels I threw him. When the meal was over, he lay down at my feet and stayed close to me. He looked at me with such kind eyes that I kissed him.
As I passed into the captain's cabin, I saw some pistols on a table; I went to look for them: if I saw a ship, I might be able to use them to attract his attention.
The day passed without a single sail being seen; the sea was only slightly choppy and the wind was barely noticeable: the Orinoco was still behaving well and the waterway must have been blind. It was without too much fear that I saw night approaching. It seemed to me that Turk and I should not be far from the coast; perhaps in the darkness I would see a lighthouse; then I would only have to steer over it to be saved.
Evening fell completely; my hope was not fulfilled. One by one the stars lit up in the depths of the sky; I saw no lighthouse.
At the same time as the pistols, I had taken a heap of clothes from the cabin: I made myself a warm mattress and sat on it, determined not to close my eyes for the whole night and to keep looking at the horizon.
For a long time I remained like this, my eyes lost in the darkness, which they tried in vain to pierce. Turc, who was lying next to me, fell asleep; the wind died down and the ship only rocked regularly, which was nothing to worry about. Around ten or eleven o'clock, the moon rose and showed me a calm sea all around, gently lapping at the light. I gradually became calmer, the dog's snoring numbed me and, despite my efforts to stay awake, I fell asleep.
But this calm on the sea was not the end of the bad weather; towards morning, I was awoken by the freshness of the wind; clouds were running low, and the sea was beginning to cloud over.
The wind freshened quickly; I went to check the compass: it indicated that it was north-westerly. I put the helm to windward because, although I didn't know where I was, it seemed like a good direction to find the coast of Normandy or Brittany.
In less than an hour, the sea became as stormy as it had been the day before, and the Orinoco began to take on water again, which was difficult to lift off the waves, or rather was not lifted off at all, so that bundles of water swept across the deck from one end to the other.
Under the force of the wind, the foremast, already shaken, creaked with sinister noises; the shrouds and ropes had weakened, and I feared, with each new gust, to see it come down. That was it, the Orinoco was sinking.
I wasn't taking my eyes off the mast when it seemed to me that I could see a dark line ahead that continued into the distance. Despite the danger, I leapt into the shrouds. It was land!
I ran to the rudder and put the helm right on that line: my legs were shaking and, by a strange effect of joy, my eyes were full of tears. Saved! Was I saved?
The line soon became quite clear. Would the Orinoco make it that far? Would the mast hold?
I spent an hour of cruel anguish there, as the wind grew ever more violent and the mast shook with creaks that gripped my heart. Turc, sitting in front of me, never took his eyes off me. He seemed to be trying to read my eyes.
The coast towards which the ship was running was low: at a certain distance from the shore, it rose gently to form hills; I could see neither villages nor harbours.
My hope, as you can well imagine, was not to get the Orinoco into a port, even if one were in front of me; that was a task beyond my strength, and even, I believe, beyond that of real sailors, with a ship in this state: I only wanted to run aground on the coast and swim away.
But would it be possible to reach the coast? Was it not defended by underwater rocks that would not let the ship pass?
In this terrible doubt, I detached the various pieces of the raft I had formed the day before, and placed them around me, to find at least one within my reach if the ship sank: I undressed, keeping only my trousers, and I waited.
The coast was now clearly visible in every detail, and I could see the waves breaking in a long line of foam on the shore: the tide was out.
Another quarter of an hour, another ten minutes, another five, and my fate would be fulfilled. Oh mother! Oh Diélette!
Just as I was allowing myself to be moved by this thought, the ship was irresistibly lifted, I heard a creak, the rudder was torn from the helm, the bell tinkled a few times, the mast wobbled, fell forward, and I was thrown flat on my stomach on the deck: the Orinoco had hit.
I got up; a second jolt made me fall again. The ship creaked from bow to stern: with a frightful shock it came to a sudden halt and lay on its side.
I wanted to get up and hold on, but I didn't have the time. A wave crashed over the poor ship, which had become an obstacle, and I felt myself being dragged into a whirlpool of water.
When I managed to get out of the whirlpool, I was already fifteen or twenty metres from the ship; a few paces away from me the dog was swimming and looking at me desperately. I encouraged him with my voice.
We were no more than two hundred metres from the beach. In normal circumstances, this distance would have been nothing to me, but with the mountains of water rushing over the shore, it was a terrible affair.
Without losing courage, I swam gently, trying above all to rise above the waves; but in the midst of these swirls of foam, it was almost impossible, and I could hardly breathe between two waves.
I couldn't see anyone on the beach, and obviously I had no hope of help. Fortunately, the wind and the sea were pushing me towards the shore. In the hollow of a wave, I felt the earth with my foot; that was the decisive moment. The wave that followed threw me against the shore like it would a bundle of kelp. I tried to dig my fingers into the sand, but the surf caught me again and I couldn't hold on.
I realised that if I wanted to continue this struggle, I would soon be drowned. I returned to the open sea: I could only save myself by a means that my father had once told me about. In a moment of rest between two waves, I reached my knife and opened it. Then I swam towards the shore, and when the wave had thrown me onto the beach, I stuck my knife into the sand, and the surf pulled me back, but I had something to hold on to and I was able to resist. When the wave receded, I got up and ran forward; the wave that came up only covered me up to my legs; I took a few more steps and fell onto the sand.
I was saved, but so exhausted that I lost consciousness. It was my Turkish friend who brought me to my senses by licking my face. His eyes were shining and he seemed to be saying to me: "Be happy, we're out of the woods". I sat down and, on the shore, I saw a customs officer and some peasants running towards me.
XIII
It was to the east of Cape Levi, four or five leagues from Cherbourg, that the Orinoco had been washed ashore.
The peasants who had come to my rescue took me to Fermanville, the nearest village, and I was put up with the priest.
I had been so badly shaken by emotions and fatigue that I slept for more than twenty hours without waking up; I even think that Turc and I would have slept for a hundred years, like in Sleeping Beauty, if the naval commissioner and the insurance agents hadn't come to disturb us.
I had to appear before them and tell them everything that had happened from the time we left Le Havre until the moment the Orinoco made landfall; I also had to tell them how I found myself in the box, and it was not without fear that I decided to do so. I had to admit the truth, however implausible it was and whatever the outcome.
The result was that I was sent to Le Havre, to the owner of the Orinoco. I embarked three days later at Cherbourg, on the Colibri, and arrived in Le Havre that same evening.
My story was already known there; the newspapers had published it and I was almost a hero, or at least a subject of curiosity. When I appeared at the top of the Colibri's ladder, there was a crowd on the quayside, and people were pointing at me and Turc, saying: "There they are!
- There they are! There they are!
I learned in Le Havre that the crew of the Orinoco had not perished; they had been picked up at sea by an English ship, and the Southampton boat had repatriated them. As for poor Hermann, he had been thrown into the sea during the collision, and either he couldn't swim, or he had been killed or injured by the pieces of the mast that had dragged him along, he had not reappeared. That explained why he hadn't come to rescue me.
My story was apparently very serious evidence against the captain: the insurers said that if he hadn't abandoned his ship, he could have saved it: since a child had been able to lead it to the shore, a crew would certainly have brought it into port. There was a lot of talk about this in Le Havre; I was questioned on all sides.
The Naufrage de la Méduse was being performed at the theatre at the time, and the director had the idea of including me in the play by giving the first performance for my benefit. People were turned away at the door. I had been given the mute role, of course, of a sailor; when I entered the stage with Turc, the actors were obliged to stop because of the applause. All the spyglasses were pointed at me and I foolishly began to believe that I was really a character. Turc might have thought the same.
The director's expenses deducted, and he must have deducted a lot, that performance brought me two hundred francs; the play was performed eight more times, and each time he gave me five francs; that made a total of two hundred and forty francs, in other words a fortune.
I resolved to use most of it to buy myself a trousseau, because my passion for the sea and my uncle's terror had withstood everything. Abandoned on the Orinoco, tossed about by the storm, thrown ashore, that is to say almost certainly to my death, I must admit that I had made some sad reflections; and the fate of those who live quietly under their roof had seemed to me more enviable than that of sailors; but when I got back on my feet, these fears had been like the water that wet my clothes: They vanished under the first ray of sunlight, and when I arrived in Le Havre, all I could think about was finding a ship on which they would be willing to take me on as a cabin boy. The owner of the Orinoco had hired me on another of his ships, the Amazon, and this money was just in time for me to buy the things I needed for my embarkation.
When I met poor Hermann, he - you remember him, don't you? - took me to stay with him. His home was a small dark room at the end of a courtyard on the Quai des Casernes. I went back there. The landlady was kind enough to rent it to me, only she warned me that she would not be able to feed me because she was ill; but that didn't worry me much, the question of food being for me completely secondary and not even existing, as soon as I was sure of having a piece of bread.
She was an excellent woman, this landlady; although she could hardly drag herself about, I found in her all sorts of thoughtfulness and kindness that reminded me of my mother's house.
She was a widow, still young, and she had a son, two years older than me, who was sailing; he had been away for eight months on a voyage to the Indies, and we were expecting the return of his ship, the Neustrie, at any moment.
There were not only these distant analogies between her and my mother in terms of position, but, like my mother too, she hated the navy. Her husband had died far from her of yellow fever in Saint-Domingue, and it was a source of constant despair to her that her son should want to go to sea. Her only consolation was to hope that this first voyage, which had been very painful on the outward journey, would have disgusted him with the trade, and that he would return prepared to stay ashore.
How impatiently she waited for him! Every time I came back from the jetty, where I spent most of my days, she wanted to know what the weather was like, where the wind was and whether many ships had come in. The voyage to India is very long, uncertain and capricious, and Neustria could arrive today, tomorrow, in a fortnight, in a month, any day.
I had been staying with her for just over a week when her illness took a worrying turn for the worse. I heard from the neighbours who came to see her or treat her that she was in danger and that the doctor no longer cared for her. In fact, she was getting weaker and weaker, very pale, almost speechless, and when I went into her room to tell her what the weather was like at sea, looking at her in bed gave me a feeling of fear.
After the gusts of wind we'd had, which had lost the Orinoco, the weather had turned fine. The sea was continually calm, as in the best days of summer, and there was even a flat calm that is unusual at this time of year.
This calm made her despair, and every time I came home and repeated what I had told her the day before: "No wind, light easterly breeze", she would shake her head gently and say:
- The good Lord is hard on me: I'll die without kissing him.
Then the neighbours or friends who were in her room would scold her for thinking about death in this way, and try to reassure her by telling her all those lies they invent for sick people who are in danger. But they didn't persuade her, and she kept repeating:
- Of course I won't see him again.
Her eyes filled with tears, and it made you want to cry like her. I wasn't quite sure what state she was in, but from what I heard I knew it was quite desperate, and I never dared go home without first asking how she was.
One morning, it was a Tuesday, I had been to see the ships come in, and I was coming back for lunch; as I arrived in front of the neighbour I used to ask, she beckoned me in.
- The doctor has come," she said.
- Well, has he?
- He says she won't make it through the day.
I didn't dare go up the stairs, but in the end I made up my mind and took off my shoes so as not to make any noise. But when I passed her door, she recognised my footsteps.
- Romain!" she said in a faint voice.
I went in; one of her sisters, who had never left her, was beside her; she beckoned me to sit down, but the sick woman called me over to her bed. She looked at me without speaking, but I understood her.
- The weather was still the same.
- No wind?
- No wind.
- What ships?
- Fishing boats, the ships of the Seine and the Lisbon steamer.
I had scarcely finished these words when the door was pushed open and her sister's husband, who worked in the port, entered. He seemed moved.
- The Lisbon steamer has arrived," he said.
- Yes, Romain has just told us.
She said this carelessly, but at the same time her eyes met those of her brother-in-law; she saw that there was something unusual about him.
- My God!" she said.
-- Well, yes, there's news; he met the Neustrie in the bay of the Isle of Sein; all is well on board.
She was lying on her bed, so pale and weak that one could almost say she was dead; she raised herself on her arm.
- My God! my God!" she said, and her extinguished eyes came back to life; the blood reddened her face.
She wanted someone to explain to her how long it would take the Neustria to get from the Ile de Sein to Le Havre. It was rather difficult: two days, if the wind was favourable; six days, eight days, if it was bad. The Lisbon steamer had taken about thirty hours, so the Neustrie could arrive the next day.
She sent for the doctor.
- I must live until then, she said; the good Lord won't let me die before I've kissed him.
When the doctor saw her, he didn't want to believe in this miracle.
It was a poor people's house; the room in which she was lying served as both kitchen and bedroom: after a fortnight's illness, it was not unusual for it to be in disarray, cluttered with a thousand objects, vases, teacups and vials lying in the dust. Strictly speaking, the patient had no-one to look after her, only friends, neighbours and her sister, who came to spend a few hours, and who soon returned home, called away by their work or their children.
She also wanted us to open the window, and when her sister refused, fearing that the air would harm her, she insisted:
- It doesn't matter to me, but I don't want it to smell sick when he arrives.
When would it arrive? The weather did not change, it was always calm, flat, without the slightest breeze that could push Neustria.
In commercial ports, it is customary to signal when a ship is in sight; in Le Havre, these signals are made at the Pointe de La Hève, repeated in Le Havre and immediately posted. She asked me if I would do her the favour of going to read these posters; I don't think I thought of apologising, and, hour after hour, I went from the Quai des Casernes to the Rue d'Orléans, where the office of the Chambre des assureurs, which received these signals, was located at the time.
But, in this dead calm, there was not a single ship in sight, all were held up at the entrance to the Channel.
However, she was not discouraged, and when evening came, she had us roll her bed to the window. There was a large weather vane on the roof of the house opposite, and she told us that she wanted to see it every moment, because she could feel that the wind was about to change. At any other time, this would have made us laugh, because against the background of the blue sky, lit by the full moon, we could see the weathervane standing out in black, motionless as if it had been welded to the pivot.
Her sister, who had stayed behind to look after her, sent me to bed. During the night, I was woken by a noise I hadn't heard since I moved into my study: a sort of creaking. I got up; it was the weathervane whirling and screaming on the iron rod; the wind had risen.
I went down the street to the pier. The sea was beginning to splash; the wind was blowing freshly from the north: a customs officer I spoke to told me that it would freshen again and probably shift to the west.
I went home to deliver this good news, because a westerly wind meant Neustria at Le Havre during the day or at the evening tide.
- You see," she said, "I was right; I knew the wind would change; ah! the good Lord is good.
Her sister told me that she hadn't slept all night, and that she had remained motionless, her eyes fixed on the weather vane, saying only one word, always the same:
- What time is high tide?
She wanted to drink a little wine; the doctor had said that she could have as much as she wanted; she barely took a sip, as she was very weak, breathing heavily and high.
- This will keep me going until then," she said.
Then her eyes turned to the weather vane and she said nothing more. Only from time to time she murmured:
- Poor Jean, poor Jean!
Jean was her son.
When the sky began to turn white, she called me to her bed:
- You're going to go to the butcher," she said, "and ask him for three pounds for the best stew; you'll also buy a cabbage.
- The cabbage will hurt," said the sister.
- It's for Jean; he loves it, and it's been so long since he's eaten it. Here's some money.
And with difficulty she pulled a penny from under her pillow.
The doctor came in the morning; he told us that he had never seen such energy against death, that she lived only by will and hope, but that, since she had made it this far, it was likely that she would now make it to the evening, and that she would not die until low tide.
When the time came for the office to open, I ran to the rue d'Orléans; the ships were starting to show up, but Neustria was not among those displayed. From eight in the morning to three in the afternoon, I made twenty trips to the rue d'Orléans; finally, at three o'clock, I read on the poster: "The Neustria, coming from Calcutta".
It was time to report this good news, because the patient was getting worse and worse, and the disappointment of not seeing her son arrive at the morning tide had dealt her a fatal blow. On hearing that Neustria had been reported, she was revitalised.
- What time is the high tide?
- At six o'clock.
- I think I'll live until then; a little wine.
I went out to the pier; there were more than twenty large ships in the roadstead, putting in broadsides as they waited for high tide. At four o'clock, the ones that weren't making much headway started to come in, but the Neustria was a very large ship and didn't enter the channel until about five o'clock.
I ran to the house; I didn't need to say anything.
- Did she get in?
- She's going in.
- Fix me up," she said to her sister, and propped herself up with pillows; only her eyes were still alive; her lips were discoloured.
A quarter of an hour later, the banister of the staircase shook as if it were being torn off: it was her son; she had the strength to lift herself up to take him in her arms.
She died that evening at eleven o'clock, at low tide, as the doctor had said.
This death, this mother's love for her son, this struggle against agony, this despair did to my mind and my heart what neither Diélette's pleas nor the wreck of the Orinoco had done.
My mother too could die while I was far from her: for the first time I saw it, I felt it.
I didn't sleep all night: the thought gripped me, strangled me. The Amazon was leaving in a fortnight, and the boat from Honfleur was leaving at five in the morning. The spirit of adventure and my uncle's fear drove me to embark; the thought of my mother kept me at the Port-Dieu. After all, my uncle wouldn't eat me. I had defended myself well against hunger, against the cold, against the storm; with courage, I could also defend myself against my uncle. If my mother didn't want me to be a sailor, she had the right to do so: did I have the right to run away without her consent? Wouldn't she be angry with me when I came back? And if I didn't come back, who would take care of her when she could no longer work?
At half past four, I boarded the boat for Honfleur; at five, I left Le Havre, and thirty-six hours later, at six o'clock in the evening, in the setting sun, I saw the first houses of Port-Dieu.
I had taken the moor, in other words the same path I had followed with Diélette; but the season had advanced since that day, and it was no longer the same path. The grass had turned green, the gorse was in flower, and in the moss of the ditches you could see the violets beginning to bloom; after a hot day, the earth and the plants exhaled a scent that expanded the lungs and exhilarated the heart.
I had never felt so happy, so joyful. My mother was going to kiss me!
When I reached our hedge, I jumped onto the embankment; twenty paces ahead of me, Diélette was picking up handkerchiefs spread out on a string.
- Diélette!
She turned towards the side where my voice was coming from; but she didn't see me, because I was hidden by the hedge.
Then I noticed that she was dressed in black, in great mourning. Mourning for what? For whom? A single cry escaped me:
- Mummy!
But before Diélette could answer me, my mother appeared on the threshold of the house and I was reassured.
A tall old man with a white beard, M. de Bihorel, appeared behind her at the same time. Him standing next to my mother! I don't know what happened to me. I thought I saw two ghosts.
Fortunately it was only a flash.
- Well, Diélette, what's the matter?" asked M. de Bihorel.
He was talking, he was alive. I wasn't mistaken. I broke through the hedge and passed through the gorse. What joy!
But I was so anxious to know how, by what miracle, the dead M. de Bihorel could be here alive before us, perfectly alive, that I gave my account in a few words.
Mr de Bihorel's story was very simple.
On his way back from Ile des Grunes, his longboat had capsized in a gust of wind; he had been able to straddle the keel, and had been picked up in that position by a three-masted ship bound from Le Havre to San Francisco. The captain of this ship, who had had the humanity to launch a dinghy to save him, had not wanted to put him ashore in a port, and Mr de Bihorel had found himself willy-nilly on his way to California: a journey of five to six months, if no ship could be found to repatriate him. This lucky chance did not materialise. At Cape Horn, he had left a letter for us in the box that navigators have established on the Isle of Fire; but this letter had never reached France. On arriving in San Francisco, he had crossed America by way of the prairies, and had only been back in France for two months.
I was not a sailor.
My uncle the Indian had died; he was mourned; he had left a large fortune which made each of his heirs rich.
Mr de Bihorel was kind enough to take me in and complete my education. As for Diélette, she entered a boarding school. If she has benefited from the lessons she received there, if she has become a worthy wife, a good mother, you'll be the judge when she comes home with her children, with our two babies, a boy and a girl, who love Mr de Bihorel as if he were their grandfather. Every day, they go to the Pierre-Gante to visit him.
I didn't sail myself, but I still had a passion for everything to do with the sea; of the thirty ships that the Port-Dieu commissions every year for the Newfoundland fishery, six belong to me.
My mother has never left Port-Dieu, and she still lives in our house; I've already had the deckhouse rebuilt twice so that nothing has changed. Every year he comes to spend two months with us and, despite his best efforts, he can't find a policeman in the area to stop him.
Mr de Bihorel, who is still alive, is now ninety-two years old. Age has weakened neither his health nor his intelligence; his tall stature is bent, but his heart remains young and good. The trees he planted have grown, and the island, in the part sheltered from the wind, is as thick as a wood; on the western side, there are still black sheep, the same family of cows and rabbits.
The gulls are always swirling around the rocks, and when they make their racket, Samedi, still as healthy and as vigorous as when he was trying to make me drink gout, never fails to ask me:
-- Romain, tscouc, couac, couac, what does that mean?
And he laughs, holding his ribs; then, if M. de Bihorel, who has been a bit hard of hearing for a few months, looks at us intrigued, he takes off his woollen cap and taking a serious look:
- If you're a man, don't forget that you owe it to him.
And that's true.
No doubt my uncle the Indian's fortune came to me at the right time; but it is no less certain that, without M. de Bihorel, without his lessons, without his examples, without the care he took over my education, without his guidance, I would hardly be anything today other than an enriched peasant, for it is not fortune that makes a man.
If this truth needed supporting, the life of my uncle Simon would be there to bear witness to it.
His brother's inheritance, added to the fortune he already had, gave him money fever. Finding himself too rich to exploit the poor peasants who didn't make enough for him, he threw himself into large-scale speculation. But there he found others more cunning and devious than he, and in a few years his partners had ruined him, so completely ruined that when everything he owned had been sold, his law firm, his house in Dol, his estate which had cost him so much pain and sweat, he was about ten thousand francs short of paying off his debts.
Precisely at that moment I had just turned eighteen and had been emancipated, which gave me free disposal of my uncle the Indian's fortune. Following the advice of my mother and Mr de Bihorel, I wanted to help Uncle Simon. But he didn't take kindly to my proposal, and we had to pay off his creditors in spite of himself and in secret: he came to our house and made a terrible scene: "We were fools, money-grubbers.
He now lives on a pension that we give him. But for that to happen we had to go about it the wrong way.
At first it was agreed that he would receive a certain sum every year. But we soon learned that instead of using this sum for his own needs, he was using most of it to make small loans and to continue his bric-a-brac business. Now we pay his board with good people, who house and feed him. But, in spite of this precaution, he still finds ways of depriving himself of the necessities in order to make a few pennies: he sells his new clothes when we give them to him.
When we reproach him, he replies that our profligacy will ruin us one day, and that we will then be happy to find the money he has wisely put aside.
