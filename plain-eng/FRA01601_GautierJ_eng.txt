I
THE LEMON WOOD
The night was drawing to a close. All was asleep in beautiful, happy Osaka. Only the strident cry of the sentries, calling out to each other on the ramparts, occasionally pierced the silence, which was no longer disturbed by anything except the distant rumour of the sea in the gulf.
Above the great dark mass formed by the palaces and gardens of the siogoun
[1] , a star was slowly fading. The morning twilight shivered in the air. The tops of the woods began to cut their waves more clearly against the bluish sky.
Soon a pale glow touched the tallest trees, then crept through the branches and foliage and filtered down to the ground.
Then, in the prince's gardens, alleys cluttered with flowering brambles took on a hazy perspective; the grass regained its emerald hue; a clump of peonies saw the brilliance of their sumptuous flowers return, and a white staircase was half revealed from the mist in the distance of an avenue.
At last, suddenly, the sky turned red; arrows of light shot through the bushes, causing drops of water to sparkle on the leaves. A pheasant shot down; a crane shook its snowy wings heavily and, with a long cry, slowly flew away into the light, while the earth smoked like a cassolette and the birds, in full voice, cheered the rising sun.
As soon as the divine star had risen from the horizon, the vibrations of a gong were heard. It was struck in a monotonous, hauntingly melancholy rhythm: four loud strokes, four soft strokes, four loud strokes, and so on and so on. It was to greet the day and announce the morning prayers.
A sudden burst of young, sonorous laughter overcame this pious noise for a moment, and two men appeared, dark against the clear sky, at the top of the white staircase.
They paused for a moment on the highest step, admiring the charming thicket of scrub, ferns and flowering shrubs that formed the banisters of the staircase.
Then they descended slowly through the whimsical shadows cast by the branches on the steps.
When they reached the foot of the stairs, they stepped aside quickly to avoid knocking over a tortoise that was walking on the last step: the tortoise's shell had been gilded, but the gilding had faded slightly in the dampness of the grass.
The two men made their way along the avenue.
The youngest of the walkers was barely twenty years old, but you would have thought he was more if you had seen the proud expression on his face and the assurance in his eyes; however, when he laughed, he seemed like a child; but he laughed little and a sort of haughty sadness clouded his charming forehead.
His costume was very simple, a grey crepe dress, a blue satin coat with no embroidery, and an open fan in his hand.
His companion's toilette, on the other hand, was extremely elaborate. The dress was made of soft white silk, tinged faintly with blue, as if it had retained a moonlight sheen; it fell in fine pleats to the feet and was cinched at the waist by a black velvet belt. The man wearing it was twenty-four years old; he was perfectly handsome; a strange charm emanated from the warm pallor of his face, from his mockingly gentle eyes and, above all, from the contemptuous nonchalance of his whole person; he rested his hand on the rich hilt of one of his two sabres, the points of which raised the folds of his black velvet coat, thrown over his shoulders with the sleeves hanging down.
The two walkers were bare-headed, their hair twisted into a rope and knotted at the top of their heads.
- Where are you taking me, gracious master?" suddenly exclaimed the elder of the two young men.
- You've asked me that question three times now, Ivakura.
- But you haven't answered me, glory of my eyes!
- Well, I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes and give me your hand.
Ivakoura obeyed, and his companion led him a few steps across the grass.
- Now look," he said.
Ivakoura opened his eyes and let out a faint cry of astonishment.
In front of him was a wood of lemon trees in full bloom.
Every tree and shrub looked as if they were covered in frost; on the tallest stems, the dawning day cast shades of pink and gold. All the branches bent under their fragrant load, the flowering bunches tumbled to the ground, on which a few too heavy twigs dragged.
Tender foliage appeared here and there in sprigs, amidst this white blossom emanating a delicious freshness.
You see," said the younger man with a smile, "I wanted to share with you, my favourite, the pleasure of seeing this marvellous blossoming before anyone else. Yesterday, when I came, the wood was like a pearl bush; today, all the flowers are open.
- When I look at this wood, I think of a saying by the poet of peach blossom, Ivakoura: "It snowed on this tree butterfly wings that, as they crossed the morning sky, were tinted pink".
- Ah," exclaimed the younger man, sighing, "I'd like to immerse myself in these flowers as if in a bath and be intoxicated to death by their violent perfume!
After admiring the flowers, Ivakoura looked a little disappointed.
- Even more beautiful flowers were about to bloom in my dream," he said, stifling a yawn. Master, why did you get me up so early?
- Come now, Prince of Nagato," said the young man, placing his hand on his companion's shoulder, "I didn't get you up; you didn't go to bed last night!
- What are you saying?" cried Ivakoura; "what makes you think that?
- Your pallor, friend, and your weary eyes.
- Am I not always like this?
- The gown you're wearing would still be too sumptuous at cock-crowing time [2]; and look! the sun is just rising, it's rabbit time
[3] .
- There is no hour too early to honour a master like you.
- Is it also to honour me, unfaithful subject, that you appear before me armed? These two swords, forgotten on your belt, condemn you; you had just returned to the palace when I summoned you.
The guilty party lowered his head, giving up his defence.
- But what's wrong with your arm?" suddenly exclaimed the younger man when he saw a thin white band protruding from Ivakoura's sleeve.
Ivakoura hid his arm behind his back and showed his other hand.
- I've got nothing," he said.
But his companion grabbed the arm he was hiding. The Prince of Nagato let out a cry of pain.
- You're hurt, aren't you! One day they'll come and tell me that Nagato was killed in a futile quarrel. What have you done now, you reckless incorrigible?
- When the Regent Hiéyas is in your presence, you will know only too well," said the Prince; "you will learn great things, O illustrious friend, about your unworthy favourite. It seems to me that I can already hear the terrible voice of this man to whom nothing is hidden: Fide-Yori, ruler of Japan, son of the great Taïko-Sama, whose memory I venerate, serious disorders have disturbed Osaka this night!...
The Prince of Nagato sounded so much like Hiéyas that the young Siogoun could not help but smile.
- And what are these disturbances? - Broken doors, beatings, uproar, scandals. - Do we know who is responsible for these misdeeds? - The one who leads the others is the only culprit and I know who that culprit is. - But who is it? - Who, if not the one you find in every adventure, in every night battle; who, if not the Prince of Nagato, the terror of honest families, the terror of peaceful people? And as you forgive me, O too merciful one, Hiéyas will reproach you for your weakness, sounding it loud and clear, so that this weakness may harm the siogoun and benefit the regent.
- But what if I were finally incensed by your conduct, Nagato," said the Siogun, "what if I sent you to spend a year in your province?
- I would go, master, without a murmur.
- Yes, and who would love me here?" said Fidé-Yori sadly. I see great devotion around me, but not an affection like yours, but perhaps I am being unfair," he added, "you are the only one I love, and it is no doubt because of that that I seem to be loved only by you.
Nagato looked at the prince with a look of gratitude.
- You feel forgiven by me, don't you?" said Fide-Yori, smiling, "but try to avoid the Regent's reproaches; you know how painful they are for me. Go and greet him, it's nearly time for him to rise; we'll meet again at the council.
- So you'll have to smile at that ugly face," grumbled Nagato.
But he had his leave. He saluted the siogun and sulked away.
Fidé-Yori continued to stroll along the avenue, but soon returned to the lemon grove. He stopped in front of it to admire it once more, and plucked a thin branch laden with flowers. But then the foliage began to rustle as if in a strong wind; a sudden movement stirred the branches and, between the blossoms, a young girl appeared.
The prince stepped back quickly and almost screamed; he thought he was the victim of a vision.
Who are you?" he exclaimed, "perhaps the genie of this wood?
- Oh no," said the young girl in a trembling voice, "but I'm a very daring woman.
She came out of the wood, amid a shower of white petals, and knelt on the grass, holding out her hands to the king.
Fidé-Yori lowered his head and looked at her curiously.
She was exquisitely beautiful: small, graceful, as if crushed beneath the fullness of her robes. It was as if their silky weight had brought her to her knees. Her large, pure eyes, like those of a child, were fearful and pleading, her cheeks, velvety like the wings of butterflies, flushed a little, and her little mouth, half-open in admiration, let her milk-white teeth shine.
- Forgive me," she said, "forgive me for being in your presence without your will.
- I forgive you, poor trembling bird," said Fidé-Yori, "for if I had known you and if I had known what you wanted, I would have wanted to see you. What do you want from me? Is it in my power to make you happy?
- O master!" cried the young girl enthusiastically, "with one word you can make me more radiant than TenSio-Daï-Tsin, the daughter of the sun.
- And what word is that?
- Swear to me that you won't go to the festival of the Sea Genie tomorrow.
- Why this oath?" said the siogun, astonished by this strange plea.
- Because," said the young girl, shivering under the king's feet, "suddenly a bridge will collapse and by evening Japan will no longer have a master.
- You must have discovered a conspiracy," said Fidé-Yori, smiling.
Faced with this smile of disbelief, the young girl paled and her eyes filled with tears.
- O pure disc of light," she cried, "he doesn't believe me! All that I have done so far is nothing. Here is the terrible obstacle and I hadn't thought of it. You listen to the voice of the cricket that announces heat, you listen to the frog that croaks a promise of rain; but a young girl who cries out to you: Beware! I have seen the trap, death is in your path, you don't listen to her and you walk straight into the trap. But that's impossible, you've got to believe me. Do you want me to kill myself at your feet? My death would be a token of my sincerity. Besides, even if I was wrong, what does it matter to you? You can always skip the party. Listen, I've come a long way, from a remote province; alone, under the heavy anguish of my secret, I've outwitted the most subtle spies, I've conquered my fears and overcome my weakness. My father thinks I'm on a pilgrimage to Kioto, and you see: I'm in your city, within the walls of your palaces.
Yet the sentries are vigilant, the moats wide, the walls high. Look, my hands are bleeding, I'm burning with fever. Just now I thought I would never be able to speak, my weakened heart trembling with the joy of your presence and the joy of saving you.
But now I'm dizzy, my blood is frozen: you don't believe me!
- I believe you and I swear to obey you," said the king, moved by this desperate accent; "I will not go to the festival of the Genie of the Sea.
The young girl let out a cry of joy and looked gratefully at the sun rising above the trees.
- But tell me how you discovered this plot," continued the siogun, "and who the perpetrators are.
Oh, don't order me to tell you. This whole edifice of infamy that I am bringing down is crumbling on myself.
So be it, young lady, keep your secret; but tell me at least where this great devotion comes from and why my life is so precious to you?
The young girl slowly raised her eyes to the king, then lowered them and blushed, but answered nothing. A vague emotion troubled the prince's heart. He remained silent and let himself be overwhelmed by this gentle impression. He would have liked to remain like this for a long time, in silence, amidst the birdsong and the perfumes, close to this kneeling child.
- Teach me who you are, you who saved me from death," he said at last, "and show me the reward worthy of your courage.
- My name is Omiti," said the young girl, "I can tell you nothing more. Give me the flower in your hand, that's all I want from you.
Fidé-Yori handed her the lemon branch; Omiti seized it and fled through the wood.
The siogun remained motionless for a long time in the same place, worried, looking at the grass trodden by Omiti's light weight.
II
NAGATO'S WOUND
The Prince of Nagato had returned to his palace.
He was asleep, stretched out on a pile of fine mats. All around him was almost complete darkness, for the blinds had been lowered and large screens put up in front of the windows.
A few walls of black lacquer glimmered in the shadows, however, and vaguely reflected, like cloudy mirrors, the prince's pale head lying back on the cushions.
Nagato had been unable to see Hiéyas: the regent was absorbed in a very urgent matter, he had been told. The young prince was delighted at this circumstance and hurried off to rest in the few hours he had to himself before the council.
In the rooms next to the one where he was sleeping, the servants came and went silently, preparing the master's toilet. They walked carefully so as not to creak the wooden floor and chatted amongst themselves in low voices.
- Our poor master has no sense," said an elderly woman, shaking drops of perfume onto a ceremonial coat. Always partying, going out at night, never resting; he'll kill himself.
- Oh no, pleasure doesn't kill you," said an insolent-looking young boy in brightly coloured clothes.
- What do you know, aphid?" said the maid. Doesn't it seem that he spends his life revelling like a lord? Don't talk so brazenly about things you don't know!
- Perhaps I know them better than you do," said the child with a grimace, "you who are not yet married, despite your great age and beauty.
The maid threw the contents of her bottle in the boy's face, but he hid behind the silver disc of a mirror that he was rubbing to make it clear, and the perfume scattered on the floor. The valet put his head forward when the danger had passed.
- Do you want me for a husband?" he said, "you'll give me some of your years, and between us we'll make a young couple!
The maid, in her anger, let out a burst of voice.
- Will you keep quiet?" said another servant, threatening her with his fist.
- But it's impossible to listen to this young rascal without getting irritated and blushing!
- Blush all you like," said the child, "it doesn't make any noise.
- Shut up, Loo!" said the servant.
Loo shrugged his shoulders and pouted, then went back to rubbing the mirror nonchalantly.
Just then, a man entered the room:
- I wish to speak to Ivakoura, Prince of Nagato," he said loudly.
All the servants waved their hands and arms to silence the newcomer. Loo rushed over to him and put the cloth he used to rub the mirror over his mouth, but the man pushed him away violently.
- What is the meaning of this? Are you fools? I want to speak to the lord you serve, the most illustrious daimio who reigns over the province of Nagato. Warn him and stop making faces.
- He's asleep," a servant said quietly.
- We can't wake him up," said another.
- He's terribly tired," said Loo, putting a finger to his mouth.
- Despite his tiredness, he'll be happy that I've come," said the stranger.
- We have orders not to wake him up until a few moments before council time," said the servant.
- I'm not the one who would risk waking him from his sleep," said Loo, pushing his mouth towards his ear.
- Nor I," said the old woman.
- I'll go myself, if you like," said the messenger; "besides, the hour of the council is near: I've just seen the Prince of Arima heading towards the Hall of the Thousand Nats.
- The Prince of Arima!" exclaimed Loo, "He's always late!
- Alas!" said the maid, "will we have time to dress the master?
Loo slid a partition into its groove and opened a narrow passageway; he then gently entered Nagato's room.
It was cool in the room, and a smell of camphor and musk filled the air.
- Master! Master!" said Loo in a low voice, "it's time, and there's a messenger here.
- A messenger!" exclaimed Nagato, rising on one elbow.
- He's dressed like a samurai
[1]: there are swords at his belt.
- Tell him to come in quickly," said the prince with a tremor in his voice.
Loo waved to the messenger, who bowed at the threshold of the room.
- Come here!" said Nagato.
But the messenger couldn't find his way in this dark room, so Loo folded a sheet of a screen that was blocking the light. A strip of light entered the room; it illuminated the delicate texture of the mat covering the floor and made a silver stork, with its undulating neck and open wings, shine on the wall.
The messenger approached the prince and handed him a thin roll of paper, wrapped in a piece of silk, then left the room backwards.
Nagato quickly unrolled the paper and read the following:
"You have come, illustrious one, I know, but why this madness and why this mystery? I cannot understand your actions. I have been severely reprimanded by my sovereign because of you. You know, I was crossing the gardens to follow her to her palace when I suddenly saw you leaning against a tree. I couldn't hold back a scream, and at this she turned towards me and followed the direction of my gaze.
Ah," she said, "it's the sight of Nagato that's making you cry out like that. Couldn't you at least hold them back and hide the spectacle of your shamelessness from me?
"Then she turned back to you several times. The wrath in her eyes frightened me. I dare not appear before her tomorrow, and I am sending you this message to beg you not to repeat these strange apparitions which have such disastrous consequences for me.
"Alas, don't you know that I love you, and must I tell you that I will be your wife whenever you want me to be? But you enjoy worshipping me like a goddess from the pagoda of the Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-Three
[2] . If you hadn't risked your life several times just to catch a glimpse of me, I'd think you were playing me.
I implore you, don't expose me to such reprimands again, and don't forget that I'm ready to acknowledge you as my lord, and that living close to you is my dearest desire."
Nagato smiled and slowly closed the scroll; he fixed his gaze on the light strip that the window threw on the floor and dreamed deeply.
The young Loo was very disappointed; he had tried to read behind his master, but the scroll was written in Chinese characters and his science was at fault; he knew the kata-kana fairly well and even had some knowledge of the hira-kana, but he was unfortunately ignorant of Chinese writing. To hide his disappointment, he approached a window and, lifting a corner of the blind, looked out.
- Ah!" he said, "the Prince of Satsouma and the Prince of Aki are arriving at the same time; the people in their retinue are looking at each other sideways. Ah! Satsouma goes in front. Oh, oh, here's the Regent crossing the avenue; he's looking this way and he laughs to see that the Prince of Nagato's retinue is still outside his door; he'd laugh a lot more if he knew where my master's toilet was.
- Let him laugh, Loo, and come here," said the prince, who had untied a brush and a roll of paper from his belt and was hastily writing a few words. Run to the king and give him this paper.
Loo ran off at full speed, jostling and knocking over anyone in his path.
- And now," said Ivakoura, "dress me quickly!
The servants hurried off, and the prince was soon dressed in the large, shaggy trousers that make the wearer look like he's walking on his knees, and the stiff ceremonial cloak, made even heavier by the insignia embroidered on the sleeves. Nagato's insignia consisted of a black line above three balls, forming a pyramid.
The young man, usually so careful with his finery, paid no attention to the work of the servants, not even glancing at the mirror, so well polished by Loo, when the high pointed cap, tied with golden ribbons, was placed on his head.
As soon as he had finished dressing, he left the palace, but his preoccupation was so great that instead of getting into the norimono, which was waiting for him in the midst of his escort, he walked away, dragging his huge trousers across the sand and exposing himself to the sun's rays. The procession, appalled by this outrage against etiquette, followed him in inexpressible disorder, while the spies, charged with monitoring the prince's actions, hastened to report to their various masters on this extraordinary event.
The ramparts of the Osaka residence, wide and high walls flanked by a semicircular bastion, form an immense square enclosing several palaces and vast gardens. To the south and west, the fortress backs onto the city; to the north, the river that flows through Osaka widens and forms a colossal moat at the foot of the rampart; to the east, a narrower river borders it. On the median of the walls, you can see a row of hundred-year-old cedars, with their dark greenery projecting their flat, horizontal branches over the battlements. Inside, a second wall, preceded by a moat, encloses the parks and palaces reserved for the princes and their families.
Between this wall and the ramparts are the dwellings of the civil servants and soldiers. A third wall surrounds the siogun's palace itself, which stands on a hill. This building was built in a simple and noble architectural style. Square towers with several roofs tower above it here and there. Marble staircases, bordered by a light lacquered balustrade and flanked at the base by two bronze monsters or two large earthenware vases, lead up to the outside galleries; the terrace in front of the palace is covered with gravel and white sand that reflects the sun's rays.
At the centre of the building stands a square tower, wide, very high and magnificently decorated. It supports seven roofs, the corners of which curve towards the sky; on the highest roof are two monstrous golden fish, which shine brightly and can be seen from all parts of the city.
In the part of the palace next to this tower is the Salle des Mille-Nattes, where the council meets.
The lords arrive from all sides; they climb the ramps of the hill and head towards the central portico of the palace, which opens onto a long gallery leading directly to the Hall of the Thousand Nats.
This vast, very high room is completely devoid of furniture. Mobile partitions, sliding in grooves, intersect it and form compartments of various sizes when they are brought together. But the partitions are always set wide apart to produce a pleasing effect of perspective. In one compartment, the panels are covered in black lacquer with gold flowers, in another in red lacquer or Jeseri wood, the veins of which naturally form pleasing patterns. Here, the wall, painted by an illustrious artist, has its reverse side stretched out in white satin embroidered with heavy flowers; elsewhere, against a background of dull gold, a peach tree, covered in pink flowers, stretches out its gnarled branches, or simply, on dark wood, an uneven pattern of white, red and black dots flickers in the eyes. The mats covering the floor are the colour of snow and fringed with silver.
The lords, with their wide trousers reaching beyond their feet, seem to be kneeling down, and the cloth ruffles the mats with a continuous noise, like the distant murmur of a waterfall. Those present remain religiously silent.
The hattamotos, people of recent nobility instituted by the regent, crouched in the furthest corners, while the samurai of ancient nobility, owners of fiefs and vassals of the princes, passed by these newly ennobled people, glancing at them with contempt, and moved closer to the large blind that had been lowered to veil the platform reserved for the siogoun. The Lords of the Land, sovereign princes in their own provinces, form a large circle in front of the throne, leaving a clear space for the thirteen members of the council.
The councillors soon arrive; they greet each other and exchange a few words in a low voice, then take their places.
On the left, with their profiles to the lowered blinds, line up the senior councillors. There are five of them, but only four are present. The closest to the throne is the Prince of Satsouma, a venerable old man with a long, kind face. Next to him lies the absent man's mat. Then comes the Prince of Sataké, nibbling his lips as he carefully arranges the folds of his toilet. He is young, dark-skinned; his eyes, very black, are extraordinarily lively. Next to him sits the Prince of Ouésougui, a slightly fat and nonchalant man. The last is the Prince of Isida, short of stature and ugly of face.
The eight lower councillors, crouching in front of the throne, are the princes of Arima, Figo, Vakasa, Aki, Tosa, Issé and Couroda.
There is a movement towards the entrance and all the foreheads bow to the ground. The regent enters the room. He moves forward quickly, unencumbered like the princes by the folds of his trousers, and sits cross-legged on a pile of mats to the right of the throne.
At the time, Hieyas was an old man. His waist arched slightly; he was broad-shouldered, however, and muscular. His half-shaven head showed a broad forehead, dented by prominent superciliary arches. His thin mouth, with its cruel, wilful expression, lowered its deeply sunken corners; his cheekbones were extremely prominent, and his slanting eyes, level with his head, glared sharply and frankly.
As he entered, he cast an evil glance, accompanied by a half-smile, towards the seat left empty by the Prince of Nagato.
But when the blind was raised, the siogun appeared, leaning with one hand on the young adviser's shoulder.
The regent frowned.
All those present prostrated themselves, resting their foreheads on the ground. When they stood up again, the Prince of Nagato was in his place like the others.
Fidé-Yori sat down and signalled to Hiéyas that he could speak.
The regent then read out a number of unimportant reports: magistrate appointments, troop movements on the border, and the change of residence of a governor after his reign had expired.
Hiéyas briefly and volubly explained the reasons for his actions. The councillors looked over the manuscripts with their eyes and, having no objections to make, nodded in agreement. But soon the regent folded up all the papers and handed them to a secretary standing next to him; then he spoke again after coughing.
- I have called this extraordinary assembly today," he said, "in order to inform it of the fears I have for the tranquillity of the kingdom on learning that the strict surveillance ordered against the monks of Europe and the Japanese who have embraced foreign doctrine is being singularly relaxed, and that they are resuming their activities, which are dangerous for public safety. I have therefore come to ask that the law ordering the extermination of all Christians be reinstated.
A strange hubbub arose in the assembly, a mixture of approval, surprise, cries of horror and anger.
- Do you want to see a return to the bloody and hideous scenes whose horror is in everyone's memories?" exclaimed the Prince of Sataké with his usual vivacity.
- It's strange to say that poor people who preach nothing but virtue and harmony can disturb the peace of a country," said Nagato.
- The daimio speaks well," said the Prince of Satsouma; "it is impossible for the monks of Europe to have any influence on the tranquillity of the kingdom. So there's no point in worrying them.
But Hiéyas spoke directly to Fidé-Yori.
- Master," he said, "since they don't want to share my concerns, I must tell you that a terrible rumour is beginning to circulate among the nobles and the people...
He was silent for a moment to give more solemnity to his words.
-... It is said that he who is still under my tutelage, that the future ruler of Japan, our gracious lord Fide-Yori, has embraced the Christian faith.
A great silence followed these words. Those present exchanged glances which clearly showed that they were aware of this rumour, which was perhaps well-founded.
Fidé-Yori spoke up.
- Is it necessary to take revenge on innocent people for a slander spread by ill-intentioned people?
I order that the Christians should not be troubled in any way.
My father, I regret to say, thought he had to pursue his anger and exterminate these unfortunate people, but I swear, as long as I live, not a single drop of their blood will be shed.
Hiéyas was stunned by the young Siogoun's resolute accent. For the first time he had spoken like a master and given orders. He bowed in submission and said nothing. Fidé-Yori had reached his majority, and if he had not yet been proclaimed siogun, it was because Hiéyas was in no hurry to deposit his powers.
The latter therefore did not want to enter into an open battle with his ward; he temporarily abandoned the question and moved on to other matters.
- I have been told," he said, "that a lord was attacked and wounded last night on the road to Kioto. I don't yet know the name of this lord; but perhaps the Prince of Nagato, who was in Kioto last night, has heard of this adventure?
- Ah, you know I was in Kioto," murmured the prince, "so I understand why there were murderers on my route.
- How could Nagato have been in Osaka and Kioto at the same time?" said the Prince of Sataké. "This morning there is nothing but talk of the water festival he gave there last night, which ended so joyously with a battle between the lords and sailors of the shores.
- I even caught a scratch in the melee," said Nagato with a smile.
- The prince crosses roads in a few hours that others would take a day to cover," says Hiéyas, "that's all.
The only thing is, he doesn't spare his horses: every time he goes back to the palace, his mount falls over and dies. The Prince of Nagato turned pale and looked for the sword missing from his belt.
- I didn't think your concern extended to the beasts of the kingdom," he said with outrageous irony. I thank you in the name of my dead horses.
The siogun, full of concern, cast pleading glances at Nagato. But it seemed that on this particular day, the regent's patience was tried and tested. He smiled and said nothing.
However, Fide-Yori could see that anger was rumbling in his friend's soul and, fearing some new outburst, he ended the session by withdrawing.
Almost immediately a palace guard came to warn the Prince of Nagato that the Siogun was asking for him. The prince greeted several lords in a friendly manner, bowed to the others and left without turning his head towards Hiéyas.
When he reached the siogun's flats, he heard a woman's voice, irritated and moaning at the same time.
It was about him.
- I have heard it all," said the voice: "your refusal to accede to the wishes of the regent, whom you allowed to be insulted before your very eyes by the prince of Nagato, whose insolence is truly incomparable; and the marvellous patience of Hiéyas, who did not take up the insult out of consideration for you, out of pity for the man you believe to be your friend, in your ignorance of men.
Nagato recognised that the speaker was the siogun's mother, the beautiful and imperious Yodogimi.
- Mother," said the siogun, "look after embroidery and ornaments; that's a woman's domain.
Nagato entered quickly, so as not to pry any longer.
Yodogimi turned round and blushed slightly as she saw the prince bowing deeply to her.
- I need to talk to you," said the siogun.
- I'll be off then," said Yodogimi bitterly, "and back to my embroidery.
She crossed the room slowly, rustling her long silky dresses, and left, giving Nagato a strange look that was both provocative and hateful.
- Did you hear my mother?" said Fidé-Yori.
- Yes," said Nagato.
- Everyone wants to take me away from you, friend; what could be their motive?
- Your mother is blinded by some calumny," said the prince; "the others see in me a clear-sighted enemy who knows how to foil the plots hatched against you.
- I wanted to talk to you about a plot.
- Against your life?
- That's exactly it. It was revealed to me in a peculiar way, and I find it hard to believe. However, I can't help worrying. Tomorrow, at the celebration of the Genius of the Sea, a bridge is due to collapse beneath my feet.
- How horrible!" exclaimed Nagato. At least don't go to that festival.
- If I don't go," said Fidé-Yori, "I'll never know the truth, because the plot won't come to light. But if I go to the party," he continued, smiling, "if the conspiracy really exists, the truth will be a bit hard to see.
- Of course," said Nagato, "but you have to get beyond the doubt, you have to find a way. Have you decided on the route you're going to take?
- Hiéyas gave it to me.
Fide-Yori took a roll of paper from the shelf. They read
"Quai du Yodo-Gava, Place du Marché-aux-Poissons, Route des Sycomores, Plage de la Mer. Return via Bamboo Hill and the Swallow Bridge...".
- The wretches!" exclaimed Ivakoura, "it's the suspension bridge over the valley!
- The place would indeed be well chosen," said the siogun.
- There's no doubt that it's this bridge; those that cross the innumerable canals of the city wouldn't expose you to death by collapsing under your feet, but at most to an unpleasant bath.
- It's true," says Fidé-Yori, "and from the Swallow Bridge you would be thrown onto the rocks.
- Do you have full confidence in my friendship for you?" said the Prince of Nagato after thinking for a moment.
- Do you doubt it, Ivakoura?" said the siogun.
- Well, don't be afraid, pretend you don't know anything, let yourself be led and walk straight to the bridge. I've found a way to save you while discovering the truth.
- I rely on you, my friend, in complete safety.
- So let me go, I'm running out of time to carry out my plan.
- Go, Prince, I entrust my life to you without trembling," said the Siogun.
Nagato left quickly after greeting the king, who responded with a friendly gesture.
III
THE FESTIVAL OF THE GENIUS OF THE SEA
The next day, from dawn, the streets of Osaka were full of movement and joy. People were preparing for the festival and looking forward to the pleasure to come. Shopkeepers', craftsmen's and common people's houses, wide open to the street, showed off their simple interiors, furnished only by a few colourful screens.
Voices and laughter could be heard, and from time to time a mischievous child would escape from the arms of his mother, who was busy dressing him in her best clothes, and come running and stamping with joy up the wooden steps leading down from the house to the pavement.
It was then with cries of feigned anger that he would be called back from inside, the father's voice would be heard and the child would go back into his mother's hands, quivering with impatience.
Sometimes one of them would cry out:
-Mother! Mother! Here comes the procession!
- You're joking," said the mother, "the priests haven't even finished dressing.
But nevertheless, she advanced towards the façade and, perched over the light balustrade, looked out into the street.
Naked couriers, minus a piece of cloth tied around their loins, run past with a bamboo stalk over their shoulder, bending at the end under the weight of a bundle of letters. They are heading for the siogoun's residence.
In front of the barber's shops, the crowd gathers; the barbers can't shave all the chins and style all the heads that come in. Those waiting their turn chat cheerfully outside the door. Some are already dressed in their brightly coloured, embroidered festive clothes.
Others are more careful, naked to the waist, preferring to finish their grooming once their hair is done. Vegetable and fish merchants walk around, loudly boasting about their wares, which they carry in two tubs suspended from a wooden crossbeam on their shoulder.
Everywhere the houses are adorned with banners, embroidered cloth, covered with Chinese inscriptions in gold on black or purple backgrounds; lanterns and flowering branches are hung.
As the morning progressed, the streets filled with more and more cheerful tumult; the norimono bearers, dressed in light tunics, tight around the waist, wearing large hats like shields, shouted to make room for each other. Samurai pass by on horseback, preceded by a runner who, head bowed, arms outstretched, splits the crowd. Groups stop to chat, sheltered under vast parasols, forming motionless islands amid the tumultuous swell of strollers. A doctor hurried in, fanning himself with gravity, followed by his two assistants carrying the medicine chest.
- Illustrious master, aren't you going to the festival?
- Sick people don't care about festivals," he said with a sigh, "and as there are none for them, there are none for us.
On the banks of the Yodogava, the bustle is even greater; the river literally disappears under thousands of boats; the masts raised, the sails still bent but ready to open like wings, the tents of the cabins covered with silk and satin fabrics, the prows adorned with banners whose gold fringes dip into the water, shine in the sun and stain the azure of the river with multicoloured shivers.
Bands of young women in shining gowns make their way down the white, stepped banks.
They head for elegant camphor-wood boats, embellished with carvings and copper ornaments, and fill them with flowers that waft warm perfumes into the air.
From the top of the Kiobassi, that beautiful bridge that looks like a stretched arch, they unfurl pieces of gauze, crepe or light silk in the freshest colours and covered with inscriptions. A light breeze gently stirs these beautiful fabrics as the boats come and go, pushing them aside as they pass. In the distance, the high tower of the residence and the two monstrous golden fish that adorn its peak shine brightly. At the entrance to the city, to the right and left of the river, the two superb bastions facing the sea have on each tower, at each corner of the walls, the white national standard with a red disc, emblem of the sun as it rises in the morning vapours. A few pagodas, high above the trees, raise their roofs one above the other against the radiant sky, their edges raised in the Chinese fashion.
It is the pagoda of Yébis, the genius of the sea, that attracts particular attention on this day; not that its towers are higher and its sacred doors more numerous than those of the neighbouring temples, but from its gardens the religious procession, so impatiently awaited by the crowd, is due to depart.
At last, in the distance, the drum resounds. We listen to the sacred rhythm, well known to all: a few violent blows, spaced out, then a hurried roll, softening and fading, then sudden blows again.
A huge cheer goes up from the crowd, who immediately line up along the houses on either side of the streets the procession is to follow.
The Kashiras, the guardians of the neighbourhoods, quickly stretched out ropes and attached them to stakes to prevent the crowd from overflowing onto the central thoroughfare. The procession set off; indeed, it crossed the Torié, the sacred portico, which rises in front of the Yébis pagoda, and soon it was denying before the impatient crowd.
Sixteen archers first came forward, one behind the other, in two widely spaced rows. They were dressed in armour made of strips of black horn joined by dots of red wool. Two swords are strapped to their belts; poisoned arrows extend beyond their shoulders and they hold in their hands a large bow of black and gold lacquer.
Behind them comes a troop of servants, wearing silk tassels at the end of long poles. Then the Tartar musicians appear, announcing themselves with a cheerful din. The metallic vibrations of the gong resound from moment to moment, the drums, beaten to excess, the shuddering cymbals, the low-pitched tones of the sea conches, the high-pitched notes of the flutes and the air-shattering blare of the trumpets, creating such an intensity of noise that the nearest spectators blink and are as if blinded.
After the musicians, a gigantic lobster appears on a high platform, ridden by a monk. Standards of all colours, long and narrow, bearing the town's coat of arms, are held by young boys and sway around the enormous crustacean. Then fifty lancers, wearing round lacquered hats, lean their spears, adorned with red tassels, on their shoulders. Two servants then lead a superbly caparisoned horse, whose mane, raised above the collar, is plaited and arranged like a rich trimming. Banner-bearers come forward after this horse; the banners are blue and covered with gold lettering. Then came two large Korean tigers, their mouths open and their eyes bloody.
A few children in the crowd shouted in fright, but the tigers were made of cardboard, and men hidden in each of their paws made them move. A giant cylindrical drum comes next, carried by two monks; a third walks alongside and frequently strikes the drum with his closed fist.
Finally, there are seven young women, splendidly adorned and greeted by a joyful hubbub. They are the most beautiful and illustrious courtesans in the city. They come forward, one after the other, majestically, full of pride, accompanied by a maid and followed by a servant who holds a large silk parasol over them. The people, who know them well, refer to them by name or nickname.
- Here's the woman with the silver teal!
Two of these birds are embroidered on the wide-sleeved cloak she wears over her many dresses, the collars of which are crossed, one below the other, on her chest; the cloak is of green satin, the embroidery of white silk, mixed with silver; the beautiful woman's headdress is pierced by enormous tortoise-shell pins, which form a semi-circle of rays around her face.
- This is the seaweed woman!
These beautiful grasses, with their silken roots embedded in the embroidery of the coat, float out of the fabric and flutter in the wind.
Then come the beautiful girl with the golden dolphin, the beautiful girl with the almond blossom, the beautiful girl with the swan, the peacock and the blue monkey. Their heads are bristling with blonde pins and their faces, skilfully disguised, appear young and charming under the soft shade of the parasol.
Behind the courtesans come men carrying willow branches; then a whole army of priests, carrying on stretchers or under pretty pavilions with gilded roofs, the accessories, ornaments and furniture of the temple, which are being purified as the procession moves along.
Finally appears the shrine of Yébis, the god of the sea, the tireless fisherman, who spends whole days, wrapped in a net, line in hand, standing on a rock half-emerging from the water. It is carried by fifty monks, naked to the waist, and looks like a square house. Its four-sided roof is clad in silver and azure, bordered by a fringe of pearls and topped by a large bird with open wings.
The god Yébis is invisible inside the hermetically sealed shrine.
On a stretcher is carried the magnificent fish consecrated to Yébis, the akame, or red woman, the favourite, moreover, of all those who love good food. Thirty horsemen armed with pikes complete the procession.
The procession makes its way through the town, followed by the crowds moving behind it; it reaches the suburbs and, after a fairly long march, reaches the seashore.
At the same time, thousands of boats arrived at the mouth of the Yodogava, which gently pushed them towards the sea. The sails open, the oars bite the water, the banners flutter in the wind, while the sun casts thousands of sparks on the azure of the stirring waves.
Fidé-Yori also arrived on the beach, along the path that runs alongside the river; he stopped his horse and stood motionless in the middle of his retinue, which was fairly small in number, as the regent had not wanted to overwhelm the religious procession with royal luxury.
As for Hiéyas, he was carried in a norimono like the mother and wife of the siogoun. He said he was ill.
Fifty soldiers, a few standard bearers and two runners formed the entire escort.
The arrival of the young prince divided the attention of the crowd, and Yébis' procession was no longer the only one to attract attention. The royal headdress, a sort of oblong golden cap, placed on Fidé-Yori's head, made him recognisable from afar.
Soon the religious procession slowly marches past the siogoun. Then the priests carrying the shrine leave the line and approach the sea.
Then the fishermen and boatmen from the shore suddenly come running, shouting, jumping and leaping, and pounce on those carrying Yébis. They simulate a battle, shouting louder and louder. The priests pretended to defend themselves, but soon the chàsse passed from their shoulders to those of the sturdy sailors. With howls of joy, the sailors entered the sea and waved their beloved god over the clear waves for a long time, while the orchestras, carried by the junks criss-crossing the sea, blasted out their joyful melodies. Finally, the sailors return to shore to the cheers of the crowd, which soon dissipates and hurries back to the city, where there is much more to do: open-air shows, sales of all kinds, theatrical performances, banquets and sake celebrations.
Fidé-Yori leaves the beach in his turn, preceded by the two runners and followed by his retinue. We enter a small, cool and charming valley, and take the path that leads to the top of the hill on a gentle slope. This path is completely deserted. In fact, since the day before, people have been forbidden to enter.
Fidé-Yori thought about the plot, about the bridge that would collapse and plunge him into an abyss. He had been thinking about it anxiously all night; but under this bright sun, in the midst of this peaceful nature, he could no longer believe in human wickedness.
However, the route he chose to return to the palace was peculiar.
"We'll take this route to avoid the crowds," said Hiéyas; but all he had to do was forbid the people to take another route, and the king could have returned to the castle without making this bizarre diversions.
Fidé-Yori looked around for Nagato. He couldn't find him.
He had asked for him twenty times since the morning. The prince was nowhere to be found.
A painful anguish overcomes the young Siogun. He suddenly wonders why his procession is so small, why there are only two runners ahead of him. He looks behind him and it seems to him that the norimono bearers are slowing down.
They reached the crest of the hill, and soon the Swallow Bridge appeared at the end of the path. On seeing it, Fidé-
Yori, with an involuntary movement, held back her horse; a precipitous beat agitated her heart. This frail bridge is boldly thrown from one hill to the other over the very deep valley. The river, swift as a torrent, leaps over the rocks with a continuous thud. However, the bridge, as usual, seems to rest firmly on the flat rocks jutting out beneath it.
The runners move forward at a steady pace. If the plot exists, they know nothing about it. The young king doesn't dare stop; he thinks he can still hear Nagato's words:
"Walk to the bridge without fear".
But Omiti's pleading voice also vibrates in his ear, and he remembers the oath he took. Nagato's silence above all frightens him. How many things could have stood in the way of the Prince's plan! Surrounded by clever spies watching his every move, he may have been kidnapped and prevented from corresponding with the king. All these thoughts tumultuously filled Fidé-Yori's mind; the last supposition made him turn pale; then, by one of those quirks of thought, frequent in extreme situations, he suddenly remembered a song he had sung as a child to familiarise himself with the main sounds of the Japanese language.
He recites it mechanically:
"Colour and fragrance vanish. What is there in this permanent world? The past day has sunk into the abyss of nothingness. It was like the reflection of a dream. - Its absence caused not the slightest disturbance."
- This is what I learned as a child," said the king to himself, "and today I recoil and hesitate before the possibility of dying.
Ashamed of his weakness, he gave the reins back to his horse.
But then a great noise was heard on the other side of the bridge and, suddenly turning the corner of the road, horses, their manes scattered and their eyes bloody, appeared, dragging after them a cart loaded with tree trunks; they rushed towards the bridge and their furious hooves sounded, with a redoubling of noise, on the wooden floor.
At the sight of these horses coming towards her, the whole of Fidé-Yori's retinue shrieked in horror; the porters abandoned the norimonos, the women got out terrified, and gathering their ample dresses, fled in all haste. The runners, who had already set foot on the bridge, turned round and Fidé-Yori instinctively threw herself aside.
But all of a sudden, like a rope that has been stretched too far that breaks, the bridge burst with a loud crash; first it bent in the middle, then it suddenly raised its two sections, sending a shower of debris everywhere. The carriage and the cart plunged into the river, the foamy water gushing up the hill. For a few moments, a horse hung by its harness, struggling above the abyss, but the ties broke and it fell. The tumultuous river began to push the horses, floating tree trunks and debris from the bridge into the sea.
- O Omiti!" cried the king, motionless with fear, "you did not deceive me! So this is the fate that was in store for me. Without your devotion, sweet young lady, my broken body would be rolling from rock to rock by now.
- Well master, you know what you wanted to know. What do you think of my carriage?" suddenly exclaimed a voice close to the king.
The king turned round; he was alone, all his servants had deserted him, but he saw a head emerge from the valley; he recognised Nagato, who was climbing rapidly up the rugged hill, and was soon close to the king.
- Ah, my friend, my brother!" said Fidé-Yori, who could not hold back his tears. How could I have inspired so much hatred? Who is the wretch who is oppressed by my life and wants to drive me out of the world?
- You want to know who this villain is, you want to know the name of the culprit?
- Do you know, friend? Tell me.
- Hieyas!
IV
THE SISTER OF THE SUN
It was the hottest hour of the day. All the rooms in the palace of Kioto are plunged into a cool darkness, thanks to the blinds drawn and the screens deployed in front of the windows.
Kioto is the capital, the sacred city, the residence of a god exiled on earth, the direct descendant of the celestial founders of Japan, the absolute sovereign, the pontiff of all the religions practised in the kingdom of the rising sun, the mikado at last. The siogun is only the first among the mikado's subjects; but the mikado, overwhelmed by his own majesty, blinded by his superhuman splendour, leaves earthly affairs to the siogun, who reigns in his place, while he absorbs himself in a solitary sense of his own sublimity.
In the middle of the palace grounds, in one of the pavilions reserved for the lords of the court, a woman is lying on the floor covered with fine braids. She raises herself on one elbow and plunges her tiny fingers into the black waves of her hair. Not far from her, a maid crouches on the floor, playing with a pretty dog of a precious breed that looks like two tussocks of black and white silk. A gotto, a thirteen-stringed musical instrument, a writing case, a roll of paper, a fan and a box full of sweets are scattered across the floor, unmasked by any furniture. The walls are lined with cedar wood, either cut to size or covered in brilliant paintings enhanced with gold and silver; half-drawn panels form openings through which you can see other rooms and, further on, still others.
- Mistress, you're sad," says the next woman. Would you like me to pluck the strings of the gotto and sing you a song to soothe you?
The mistress shook her head.
- What's the matter? Fatkoura doesn't like music any more?
Has she forgotten that she owes it to her to see the light of day?
When the Sun Goddess, angered by the gods, withdrew to a cave, it was by letting her hear the divine music for the first time that she was brought back to heaven!
Fatkoura sighed and said nothing.
- Would you like me to grind some ink for you? For a long time now, your paper has remained as intact as the snow on Mount Fousi. If you have a problem, throw it into the worm mould and you'll be rid of it.
- No, Tika, you can't be delivered from love, it's a very burning evil that bites you day and night and never puts you to sleep.
- Unhappy love perhaps, but you are loved, mistress! said Tika, coming closer.
- I don't know what snake hidden deep in my heart is telling me that I'm not.
- How!" said a surprised Tika, "hasn't he, by a thousand follies, revealed his deep passion? Hasn't he come these last few days, risking his life, because the wrath of the Kisaki could be fatal to him, to catch a glimpse of you for a moment?
- Yes, and he ran off without saying a word to me, Tika! added Fatkoura, nervously grabbing the girl's wrists. He didn't even look at me.
- That's impossible!" said Tika, "didn't he tell you that he loved you?
- He told me so, and I believed him, so much I wanted to believe him; but now I don't believe him any more.
- Why not?
- Because if he loved me, he would have married me long ago and taken me to his States.
- But his affection for his master keeps him at the Osaka court!
- That's what he says, but is that how love speaks? What would I not sacrifice for him! ... alas! I thirst for his presence!
His face, so haughty, yet so gentle, passes before my eyes; I want to stare at it, but it slips away. Ah, a few happy months spent close to him, and then I would kill myself, falling asleep in my love, and past happiness would be a soft shroud for me.
Fatkoura burst into tears and threw her face into her hands.
Tika tried to console her, wrapped her arms around her and spoke a thousand sweet words, but she was unable to soothe her.
Suddenly, a noise was heard at the back of the flat.
The little dog began to bark in a high-pitched tone.
Tika got up quickly and leapt out of the room to prevent any servants from entering and seeing her mistress's excitement.
- It's him! It's him!" she cried; "he's here, he wants to see you.
- Don't be silly, Tika," said Fatkoura, rising to her feet.
- Here's his ticket.
And she held out a piece of paper to Fatkoura, who read it at a glance: "Ivakoura Terumoto Mori, Prince of Nagato, requests the honour of being admitted to your presence.
- My mirror!" she cried in panic. I look horrible like this, with swollen eyes, messy hair and a dress without embroidery. Alas! instead of moaning, I should have foreseen his coming and taken care of my grooming since dawn!
Tika had brought the polished metal mirror, as round as the full moon, and the box of make-up and perfumes.
Fatkoura took a brush and lengthened her eyes, but her hand was trembling; she pressed too hard, then, wanting to repair the damage, she only succeeded in smearing her whole cheek with black. She clenched her fists in rage and gritted her teeth. Tika came to her rescue and removed the traces of her clumsiness: she put a little green blush on her lower lip, which turned pink on contact with the skin. To replace the carefully plucked eyebrows, she made two large black patches high on her forehead, designed to make the oval of her face appear more elongated. She spread a little pink powder on her cheekbones, then hurriedly removed all the toiletries and threw a magnificent kirimon over her mistress's shoulders.
Then she ran out of the room.
Fatkoura stood trembling beside the fallen gotto, holding her ornate cloak in one hand and gazing eagerly towards the entrance to the room.
Finally, Nagato appeared. He stepped forward, resting one hand on the golden hilt of one of his two swords, and bowed with noble grace:
- Forgive me," he said, "beautiful Fatkoura, for arriving here like a storm in the sky unheralded by a few precursory clouds.
- You are to me like the sun when it rises over the sea," says Fatkoura, "and you are always expected. Here, I was busy crying because of you. Look, my eyes are still red.
- Your eyes are like the evening star and the morning star," said the prince. But why do they drown their rays in tears? Have I caused you some pain?
- You are here, and I have forgotten the cause of my sorrow," said Fatkoura, smiling; "perhaps I was crying because you were far from me.
- I wish I were still here," exclaimed Nagato, with such an accent of truth that the young woman felt her fears vanish and a flash of happiness light up her face.
Perhaps, however, she had misunderstood the meaning of the prince's words.
- Come and rest on these mats next to me," she said, "and Tika will serve us tea and sweets.
Couldn't I first send the Kisaki a secret request of the utmost importance? said Nagato. I took the pretext of this precious missive to get away from Osaka," he added, seeing a shadow on Fatkoura's forehead.
- The sovereign has been strict with me since your last appearance; I wouldn't dare go near her or send any of my servants to her palace.
- However, this document must be in her hands as soon as possible," said Nagato, with an imperceptible frown.
- What should I do?" said Fatkoura, not unaware of this slight sign of discontent. Would you like to follow me to one of my illustrious friends, the noble Iza-Farou-No-Kami? She is in favour at the moment, perhaps she can be of use to us.
- Let's go to her without further ado," said the prince.
- Let's go," said Fatkoura with a sigh.
The young woman called Tika, who was standing in the next room, and motioned to her to pull open a panel that opened onto a gallery running along the outside of the pavilion.
- You're going out, mistress", said Tika, "should we tell your suite?
- We're going out incognito, Tika, for a walk in the orchard; in reality," she added, putting a finger to her lips, "we're on our way to see the noble Iza-Farou.
The next woman bowed her head in agreement.
Fatkoura bravely set foot on the gallery, but she drew back quickly with a shout.
- It's a furnace! she cried.
Nagato picked up the fan he'd left on the ground.
- Courage," he said, "I'll cool the air next to your face.
Tika took a parasol and opened it over her mistress's forehead, while Nagato waved the large fan. They set off, sheltered at first by the overhanging roof. Fatkoura walked first, touching the exposed cedar balustrade with her fingertips from time to time and squealing as she touched it. The pretty, silky-haired dog, who had felt obliged to join the strollers, followed at a distance, no doubt grumbling some observations about the insanity of a walk at such an hour.
They turned the corner of the house and found themselves on the front landing of a wide staircase leading down to the garden, between two banisters adorned with brass balls; a third banister, placed in the centre of the staircase, separated it in two.
Despite the unbearable heat and the bright light reflecting off the ground, Fatkoura and the Prince of Nagato pretended to be strolling along with no other aim than to pick a few flowers and admire the charming views that opened up at every step. Although the gardens seemed deserted, they knew that the spy's eye never closed. They hurried along a shady path and soon reached a group of sumptuous pavilions, scattered among the trees and linked by covered galleries.
- This is it," said Fatkoura, who, far from looking towards the houses she was pointing at, had bent down towards a small pond full of water so pure it was almost invisible.
- Look at this pretty fish," she said, raising her voice deliberately, "it looks like it's been carved from a piece of amber. And this one, which looks like a ruby powdered with gold; it seems to be suspended in mid-air, so transparent is the water. Look, its fins are like black gauze and its eyes like balls of fire. Decidedly, in all the palace, Iza-Farou has the most beautiful fish.
- I can't believe it! Fatkoura!" cried a woman's voice from inside a pavilion, "are you out at this time of night? Is
Is it because you're a widow that you take so little care of your complexion and are going to let it be devoured by the sun?
A blind was half raised and Iza-Farou stuck out her pretty head bristling with blonde pins.
- Ah!" she said, "the lord of Nagato! You won't pass my house without doing me the honour of entering," she added.
she added.
- We'll be delighted to enter, and we thank chance for bringing us this way," said Fatkoura.
They climbed the stairs to the pavilion and made their way through the flowers that filled the gallery.
Iza-Farou came to meet them.
- What do you have to say to me?" she asked her friend in a low voice, as she greeted the prince graciously.
- I need you," said Fatkoura; "you know I'm in disgrace.
- But can I assure the sovereign that you will never again commit the offence that has so angered her?" said Iza-Farou, casting a mischievous glance at Nagato.
- Fatkoura is not responsible for the actions of a madman like me.
- Prince! I think she's proud to be the cause of what you call madness, and many women are jealous of her.
- Don't mock me," said Nagato, "I've been punished enough for bringing the wrath of the sovereign down on the noble Fatkoura.
- But that's not the point," exclaimed Fatkoura. The lord of Nagato has an important message that he would like to send secretly to the Kisaki; he first approached me; but as I cannot approach the queen at the moment, I thought of your kind friendship.
- Give me this message," said Iza-Farou, turning to the prince; in a few moments it will be in the hands of our illustrious mistress.
- You can see how grateful I am," said Nagato, taking from his chest a white satin envelope containing the missive.
- Wait for me here, I'll be back soon.
Iza-Farou took the letter and ushered her guests into a cool, dark room, where she left them alone.
- These pavilions communicate with the palace of the Kisaki," said Fatkoura, "so my noble friend can visit the sovereign without being seen. May the gods grant that the messenger brings a favourable reply and that I may see the cloud that obscures your forehead disappear.
The prince did indeed appear absorbed and worried; he nibbled on the tip of his fan as he went back and forth in the room.
Fatkoura followed him with her eyes and, in spite of herself, her heart sank; she felt the return of the terrible anguish that had brought tears to her eyes a few moments before, and which the presence of her beloved had suddenly calmed.
presence had suddenly calmed.
- He doesn't love me," she murmured in despair; "when his eyes turn towards me, they frighten me with their icy, almost contemptuous expression.
Nagato seemed to have forgotten the presence of the young woman; he was leaning against a half-drawn panel, and seemed to be savouring a dream that was both sweet and poignant. Iza-Farou returned; she seemed to be hurrying and soon appeared at the bend in the gallery; two young boys, magnificently dressed, followed her.
- These are the words of the divine Kisaki," she said when she was near Nagato: "Let the supplicant himself come and ask for what he wants.
At these words Nagato turned so pale that lza-Farou, frightened and thinking he was going to faint, rushed towards him to prevent him from falling.
- Prince," she cried, "get over yourself; such a favour is indeed capable of causing great emotion, but aren't you used to all the honours?
- It's impossible," Nagato murmured in a voice that was barely distinct, "I can't appear before her.
- How," said Iza-Farou, "do you mean to disobey her order?
- I'm not in court costume," said the prince.
- She is dispensing with the ceremonial this time, as the reception is secret. Don't keep her waiting any longer.
- Let's go, take me with you," suddenly exclaimed Nagato, who seemed to be taming his emotion.
- These two pages will guide you," said Iza-Farou.
Nagato moved off quickly, preceded by the Kisaki's two servants, but he could still hear a muffled cry escaping from Fatkoura's lips.
After walking for some time, passing unseen through the galleries and halls of the palace, Nagato came to a large curtain of white satin embroidered with gold, whose wide, shiny folds, silver in the light, lead-coloured in the half-light, lay thickly on the floor.
The pages pushed aside the drapery, the prince stepped forward and the shivering waves of satin fell behind him.
The walls of the room he entered glowed dully in the half-light, with flashes of gold, the whiteness of pearls and crimson reflections; an exquisite perfume wafted through the air. At the far end of the room, under the curtains draped with gold cords, the radiant sovereign was seated, surrounded by the silky undulations of her red dresses, the three golden blades, the insignia of omnipotence, rising from her forehead. The prince kissed her with an involuntary glance, then, lowering his eyes as if he had been looking at the midday sun, he walked to the middle of the room and threw himself on his knees, then slowly sank face down on the floor.
- Ivakoura," said the Kisaki, after a long silence, "what you are asking of me is serious: I want some explanations from you before I send your request to the sublime master of the world, the son of the gods, my husband.
The prince half rose to his feet and tried to speak, but he could not; he felt as if his chest would burst with the beating of his heart; the word died on his lips and he remained, his eyes downcast, pale as a dying man.
- Is it because you think I'm angry with you that you're so frightened?" said the queen, after looking at the prince with surprise for a moment. I can forgive you, for your crime is a minor one. You love one of my daughters, that's all.
- No, I don't love her!" exclaimed Nagato, who looked up at his sovereign as if he had lost his mind.
- What do I care!" said the Kisaki in a brief voice.
For a second their eyes met, but Nagato closed his guilty eyes and, shuddering at his audacity, awaited his punishment.
But, after a silence, the Kisaki resumed in a calm voice:
- Your letter reveals a terrible secret to me, and if what you suppose is true, the peace of the kingdom may be deeply disturbed.
- This is why, divine sister of the sun, I have had the audacity to ask for your almighty intercession," said the prince, unable to completely control the tremors in his voice. If you grant my prayer, if I obtain what I ask, great misfortunes can be prevented.
- As you know, Ivakoura, the celestial Mikado is in favour of Hiéyas; will he believe in this crime of which you accuse his protégé, and will you publicly support this accusation, which has been secret until now?
- I will support it in front of Hiéyas himself," said Nagato firmly; "he is the author of the odious plot that almost cost my young master his life.
- This statement will put your life in danger. Have you thought about that?
- My life is nothing," said the prince. Besides, the mere fact of my devotion to Fide-Yori is enough to earn me the hatred of the regent. A few days ago, on leaving Kioto, I was almost murdered by people posted by him.
- What prince! Is that really possible? said the Kisaki.
- I only mention this unimportant fact," Nagato continued, "to show you that crime is familiar to this man and that he wants to get rid of those who stand in the way of his ambition.
- But how did you escape the murderers?" asked the queen, who seemed to be taking a keen interest in this adventure.
- The sharp blade of my sword and the strength of my arm saved my life. But is it possible that you stopped your sublime thought on such a futile incident?
- Were there many assassins?
- Ten or twelve perhaps, I killed a few of them, then launched my horse, which soon put enough distance between them and me.
- What!" said the dreamy Kisaki, "this man who has the confidence of my divine husband is so treacherous and ferocious. I share your fears, Ivakoura, and sad forebodings overwhelm me, but will I be able to persuade the mikado that your predictions are not in vain? I will at least try, for the good of my people and the salvation of the kingdom. Go, Prince, be at the reception this evening; I will have seen the master of the world.
After prostrating himself, the prince got up and, with his forehead bowed to the ground, walked backwards, reaching the satin curtain.
Once again, in spite of his will, he looked up at the sovereign who was watching him. But the curtain fell back and the adorable vision disappeared.
The pages led Ivakoura to one of the palaces reserved for sovereign princes visiting Kioto. Happy to be alone, he stretched out on some cushions and, still moved, plunged into a delightful reverie.
- Ah," he murmured, "what strange joy envelops me! I'm drunk. Perhaps it was breathing the air around him? Ah, terrible madness!
terrible madness, hopeless desire that makes me suffer so gently, how much will you not increase as a result of this unexpected meeting! I used to flee from Osaka, distraught, like a diver running out of air, and I would come here to contemplate the palaces that hide her from view, or sometimes to catch a glimpse of her from afar, leaning against a gallery or crossing a garden path among her wives, and then I would take with me a supply of happiness. But now I have breathed in the perfume that emanates from her, her voice has caressed my ear, I have heard my name vibrate on her lips. Will I be able to be content with what once filled my life? I am lost, my existence shattered by this impossible love, and yet I am happy. Soon I will see her again, no longer constrained by a political audience, but able to dazzle myself with her beauty. Will I have the strength to hide my confusion and my criminal love? Yes, divine sovereign, before you alone my proud soul has been able to prostrate itself and my dream rises towards you like mist towards the sun. Goddess, I adore you with awe and respect; but, alas! I also love you with a mad tenderness as if you were only a woman!
V
THE SKY RIDERS
Night has come. The heat of the day has been replaced by a delightful coolness and the flowers in the flowerbeds, wet with dew, give off their fragrance.
The galleries before the palace halls, where the evening's entertainment takes place, are lit up and crowded with guests, who breathe in the delightful evening air. The Prince of Nagato climbed the Great Staircase, lined on either side by a lively banister of pretty pages, each holding a golden rod at the end of which a round lantern was swinging. The prince crosses the galleries slowly, because of the crowds; he bows when he meets a high dignitary of the court, greets the princes who are his equals with a friendly phrase and approaches the throne room.
The throne room glows with the light of lanterns and lamps. A joyful hubbub fills it and the neighbouring flats, which can be seen through the wide gap in the panels.
The ladies-in-waiting are whispering to each other, their voices mingling with the slight rustle of their dresses, whose abundant folds they are arranging. Seated to the right and left of the royal dais, these princesses form groups; each group has its own hierarchical rank and special colours. In one group the women are dressed in light blue gowns with silver trim, in another in green, lilac or pale yellow gowns.
At the top of the dais, covered with soft carpets, the Kisaki shines amidst the streams of satin, gauze and silver brocade that make up her ample red or white dresses, with gems streaming through them. The three vertical blades on top of her tiara look like three rays of gold above her forehead.
Some of the princesses have climbed the steps to the throne and, kneeling on the highest step, talk cheerfully with the sovereign; she sometimes lets out a light laugh that will scandalise some silent old prince, a faithful guardian of the rules of etiquette. But the sovereign is so young, not yet twenty, that it is easy to forgive her for not always feeling the weight of the crown on her forehead, and when she laughs, joy bursts forth from all sides like the songs of birds at the first rays of the sun.
- Praise the high gods!" said a princess in a low voice to her companions, "the worry that saddened our sovereign has finally dissipated: she is happier this evening than ever.
- Is she in a merciful mood! said another. Fatkoura is back in grace. She climbs the steps to the throne. The Kisaki has sent for her.
Fatkoura was indeed standing on the top step of the royal dais; but the gloomy expression of her features, the fixed, bewildered look in her eyes contrasted sharply with the cheerful, serene expression on everyone's face.
She thanked the Kisaki for returning her favours, but she did so in a voice so mournful and strangely troubled that the young queen shuddered and looked up at her former favourite.
- Are you ill?" she said, surprised by the change in the young woman's features.
- The joy of being forgiven, perhaps," stammered Fatkoura.
- I'll excuse you from staying for the party, if you're suffering.
- Thank you," said Fatkoura, who, after bowing deeply, walked away and lost herself in the crowd.
The sounds of a hidden orchestra soon burst forth and the entertainment began.
A curtain rises on the wall facing the throne, revealing a charming landscape.
Mount Fousi rises in the background, its snow-capped peak visible above a collar of clouds; the deep blue sea, dotted with a few white sails, unfurls at the foot of the mountains; a path undulates in the foreground, between trees and flowering groves.
A young man comes forward, bows his head and looks tired and sad. The orchestra falls silent. The young man raises his voice; he tells how misfortune has pursued him; his mother died of grief when she saw the fields, cultivated by her husband, becoming more and more barren; he followed his mother's coffin weeping, then worked himself to death to support his old father; But the father died in his turn, leaving the son so destitute that he did not have the money to have him buried; so he sold himself into slavery and used the price of his freedom to pay his father his last respects; now he is going to his master's house to fulfil the terms of his contract. He is about to set off when a beautiful woman appears on the road. The young man gazed at her in admiration.
- I want to ask you for a favour," said the woman; "I am alone and abandoned, accept me as your wife, I will be devoted and faithful to you.
- Alas!" said the young man, "I own nothing, and even my body does not belong to me. I have sold myself to a master to whom I am going.
I'm skilled in the art of weaving silk," said the stranger; "take me to your master, I'll be useful.
- I consent with all my heart," said the young man, "but how is it that a woman as beautiful as you are wants to take a poor man like me as her husband?
- Beauty is nothing compared to the qualities of the heart," said the woman.
The second part shows the two spouses working in their master's gardens: the man cultivating flowers, the woman embroidering a wonderful fabric she has woven. The master is walking around, watching the slaves; he approaches the young woman and looks at her work.
- Oh, the splendid fabric!" he exclaimed, "it's priceless.
- I wanted to give it to you in exchange for our freedom.
The master agreed to the deal and let them go.
The husband threw himself at his wife's feet and thanked her effusively for having freed him from slavery. But the woman is transformed: she becomes so brilliant that the young man, dazzled, can no longer look at her.
- Your courage at work and your filial piety have touched me, and seeing you unhappy, I have come down from heaven to help you. Everything you undertake from now on will succeed if you never leave the path of virtue.
Having said this, the divine weaver ascended to heaven and resumed her place in the house of the silkworms.
[1] .
The orchestra plays a dance tune. The curtain lowers and soon rises again. It reveals the garden of a pagoda with its bamboo groves and light buildings with vast roofs supported by a tangle of beams of all colours.
Pantomime scenes follow one another without being linked. Religious or warlike legends are staged; fabulous heroes and symbolic characters appear in the costumes of ancient times, some wearing the egg-shaped mitre, others the tunic with long open sleeves, others the ancient helmet without crest, with its gold ornaments protecting the nape of the neck, or a fantastic headdress, wide and high, in the shape of a golden pyramid and all trimmed with fringes and bells; These figures hold branches, swords, mirrors and all sorts of emblematic objects. But often the meaning of the symbol is forgotten, no one understands it any more; it has passed through the ages without losing any of its appearance, but it is like a locked chest whose key has been lost.
Here is the hero who killed a terrible dragon, who lived for many years in the very palace of the Mikados.
Here is Zangou, the royal warrior, who conquered Korea; Yatzizoné the invincible, whose shield is his fan; the illustrious prince who became blind from mourning the death of his beloved, all passing by representing the main event of their lives.
Then the stage empties and, after a prelude from the orchestra, young, charming dancers appear, dressed in resplendent costumes, with bird or butterfly wings on their shoulders and long antennae on their foreheads, trembling gently above their gold crowns, which are cut to size; They perform a slow, limp dance, full of undulations and swaying motions, and when they have finished, they form groups on either side of the stage, while comic dancers with false noses and extravagant costumes make their entrance and end the show with a frenzied dance full of blows and falls. 
Since the performance began, the Prince of Nagato had been leaning against a wall near the theatre and, half-hidden in the folds of a drapery, while all eyes were fixed on the stage, he gazed madly at the sovereign, smiling and radiant.
The queen seemed to feel the weight of this ardent and tenacious gaze upon her, for once she turned her head and locked eyes with the prince.
He did not lower his eyelids, an all-powerful charm prevented him from doing so: that gaze, coming down on him like a ray of sunlight, burned him. For a moment he thought he was mad; it seemed to him that the Kisaki was imperceptibly smiling at him. She immediately lowered her eyes and looked attentively at the flowers embroidered on her sleeve, then, raising her head, she seemed to be following the performance attentively.
When the curtain came down for the last time, amidst the hubbub of conversation, which resumed after a long silence, when agitation succeeded immobility, a woman stopped in front of Nagato.
- I know your secret, Prince," she told him in a low but threatening voice.
- What do you mean?" exclaimed Nagato. I don't understand you, Fatkoura.
- You understand me very well," continued Fatkoura, looking at him fixedly, "and you are right to turn pale, for your life is in my hands.
- My life," murmured the prince, "I will bless him who delivers me from it.
The young woman had moved away, but there was a great movement on the queen's side, all the ladies-in-waiting had risen and silence was restored in the audience.
The Kisaki was descending the steps of her throne. She walked slowly into the hall, dragging streams of satin behind her.
The princesses, in groups according to their rank, followed her at a distance, stopping when she did. All those present bowed deeply as she passed; she said a few words to an illustrious daimio or a woman of high birth, then continued on her way, arriving in front of the Prince of Nagato.
- Ivakoura," she said, pulling from her breast a sealed letter wrapped in a piece of green satin, "give this paper to the mother of the siogun on my behalf. And she added lower down: This is what you asked for. The Mikado orders that you should not use this document until you are certain that Hiéyas wants to perjure himself.
- Your orders will be faithfully carried out," said Nagato, who took the letter trembling. This very night I shall return to Osaka.
- May your journey be a happy one!" said the Kisaki in a voice that was strangely gentle.
Then she passed on, and for a moment the prince heard the whisper of her dresses brushing against the carpets.
An hour later, Nagato left the dairi and set off.
As he rode through the town, he had to keep his horse in step so as not to knock over the joyful crowds that crowded the streets.
Huge lanterns made of glass, paper, gauze or silk were shining on all sides; their multicoloured glow cast strange reflections on the faces of the strollers who, as they moved along, appeared pink, blue, lilac or green. The horse was a little frightened by the deafening noise that reigned in Kioto. It was the bursts of laughter from the women, stopped in front of a puppet theatre; the tambourine whirring incessantly and accompanying the prodigious tricks of a troupe of tightrope walkers; the shouts of an argument that degenerated into a battle, the silver bells struck by fate, answering a sorcerer who was telling the future to an attentive circle ; the high-pitched chants of the priests of Odjigongem, performing a sacred dance in the garden of a pagoda; then the clamour of a whole army of beggars, some mounted on stilts, others dressed in historical costumes or wearing for a hat a vase in which a flowering shrub is blooming. 
There, begging brothers, dressed in red and their heads completely shaven, puff out their cheeks and blow silver whistles that pierce the tumult and pierce the ears; priestesses from the national cult pass by singing and waving a white paper pin, a symbol of purity; A dozen or so young bonzes, playing all sorts of instruments, strain their ears and try to hear each other, so as not to lose the measure of the melody they are playing, despite the general uproar, while further on a tortoise charmer strikes a tom-tom with precipitous blows and blind people, seated at the entrance to a temple, take turns banging on bells, bristling with bronze pustules. 
From time to time, lords of the mikado's court would break through the crowd; they would go incognito to the theatre, or to one of the teahouses that remained open all night, where, freed from the rigours of etiquette, they could drink and enjoy themselves at their leisure.
Nagato, too, was travelling incognito and alone; he didn't even have a runner to keep the crowds at bay. Nevertheless, he managed to get out of the city without harming anyone. He then gave the reins back to his impatient horse, which soon galloped along a magnificent avenue of sycamore trees, lined with pagodas, temples and chapels that the prince could see spinning to right and left, each one throwing a shred of prayer or sacred chant into his ears. Once Ivakoura turned round and looked back for a long time; through the branches he had caught sight of the tomb of Taïko-Sama, the father of Fidé-Yori; he thought that the ashes of this great man must have shuddered with joy as the man who was going to bring salvation to his son passed by them. He passed the suburbs and climbed a small hill.
He took one last look at the city so dear to his heart. It was shrouded in a luminous mist, red amid the blue glow that the moon cast over the surrounding mountains. On the slopes, between the trees, a few pagoda roofs shone like mirrors. The golden chrysanthemum over the gate of the Daïri had caught a ray and seemed like a star hanging over the city. But everything disappeared behind the folds of the ground; the last rumour of Kioto died away.
The prince heaved a sigh, then, urging his horse on, he dashed like an arrow across the countryside.
He passed several villages along the way and, after an hour, reached Yodo. He crossed the town without slowing his pace and passed a castle, its high towers bathed in moonlight and the water in its moat glistening.
This castle belonged to Yodogimi, the mother of the siogun; it was inhabited at the time by a favourite of this princess, General Harounaga.
- I have little confidence in the worth of the handsome warrior who sleeps behind these ramparts," murmured the prince, glancing at the silent castle.
A moment later he was galloping through a rice field.
On all sides the moon was reflected in pools of water from which the thin ears of rice rose. The rice field resembled a vast pond; fine white mists floated here and there in sheets, close to the ground, and a few large black buffalo, lying half in the water, slept peacefully.
Nagato slowed the pace of his horse, which was panting; soon he threw the bridle over its neck and, lowering his head, plunged back into his tyrannical reverie. The horse began to walk, and the prince, absorbed, let it do as it pleased.
Nagato saw again the shining halls of the palace and the sovereign coming towards him; he thought he could still hear the rustle of the fabrics around her.
- Ah!" he suddenly exclaimed, "that letter that touched her breast, it's pressing against my heart now and burning me.
He pulled the letter from his chest.
- Alas, I shall have to part with this priceless relic," he murmured.
Suddenly he pressed his lips to it. The touch of the soft fabric and the familiar scent that emanated from it sent a burning shiver through the prince's veins. He closed his eyes, overcome by a delicious languor.
A worried neigh from his horse drew him out of his ecstasy.
He plunged the royal missive back into his bosom and looked around. About fifty paces ahead, a group of trees cast their shadows across the road. Nagato thought he saw something stirring in the shadows. He grabbed the pike attached to his saddle and urged his horse, which was stumbling and moving forward only reluctantly.
Soon the prince had no more doubts: armed men were waiting for him as he passed.
- What, again!" he exclaimed. The Regent really wants to get rid of me.
- This time he won't miss you," replied one of the assassins, throwing his horse towards the prince.
- You haven't got me yet," said Nagato as his horse swerved.
His opponent, carried away by the momentum, passed close to him without hitting him.
- What a fool I am," murmured the prince, "to expose this precious message to the vagaries of my fortune.
The naked swords shone around him; the attackers were so numerous that they could not all approach the one they were attacking at the same time.
Nagato was the most skilful marksman in the whole kingdom, full of strength, composure and daring. Twirling his pike, he broke several swords around him, the splinters of which fell amid a shower of blood; then, by making sudden jumps with his horse, he escaped for a moment from the blows intended for him.
- I may be able to defend myself for a few minutes yet, he thought
but I am obviously lost.
A buffalo woke up and let out a long, sad roar, then all that could be heard was the clanking of iron and the trampling of horses.
But suddenly, a voice burst through the night.
- Courage, Prince!" it shouted, "we're coming to help you!
Nagato was covered in blood, but he was still fighting. The voice gave him new strength as it paralysed the assassins, who exchanged worried glances.
A hurried gallop sounded and, before they could recognise each other, a large group of horsemen swooped down on the prince's attackers.
Nagato, exhausted, withdrew a little to one side and looked with surprise, without really understanding what was happening, at these defenders who had arrived at such an opportune moment.
These men looked charming in the moonlight, which illuminated the rich embroidery on their robes and shot blue flashes from their light helmets with their cut-out ornaments.
The prince recognised the costume of the Riders of Heaven, the honour guard of the Mikado.
Soon, all that remained of the assassins posted by the regent were the dead. The victors wiped their weapons clean, and the leader of the troop approached Nagato.
- Are you badly hurt, Prince?" he asked.
- I don't know," replied Nagato: in the heat of battle, I didn't feel a thing.
- But your face is covered in blood.
- That's true," said the prince, putting his hand to his cheek.
- Do you want to get off your horse?
- No, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to get back on. But let's not talk about me any more; let me thank you for your miraculous intervention, which saved my life, and ask you how you came to be on this road at this time.
- I'll tell you that later," said the rider, "but not before I've dressed this wound that's going to let all your blood escape.
Water was fetched from a nearby pond and washed over the prince's face: a fairly deep gash appeared on the forehead near the temple. For the time being, all they could do was wrap a tight bandage around his forehead.
- You have other wounds, don't you?
- I think so, but I feel strong enough to get to Osaka.
- Well, off we go!" said the rider, "we'll talk while we walk.
The little troop set off.
- So you're escorting me?" said Nagato.
- We have orders not to leave you, Prince, but it is a pleasure for us to fulfil this duty.
- Will you do me the honour of telling me your glorious name?
said Nagato, bowing.
- You know me, Nagato, I am Farou-So-Chan, lord of Tsusima.
- The husband of the beautiful Iza-Farou whom I had the glory of seeing this very day! cried Nagato. Forgive me, I should have recognised you from the terrible blows you dealt my attackers, but I was blinded by blood.
- I am proud and happy to have been chosen to assist you, and to prevent any unfortunate consequences that might have resulted from your reckless audacity.
- I have indeed acted with unforgivable lightness," said Nagato; "I had the right to risk my life, but not to expose the precious message I carry.
- Let me tell you, dear prince, that the envelope you carry contains nothing but blank paper.
- Could this be?" exclaimed Nagato, "Could I have been fooled?
In that case, I can't survive this insult.
- Calm down, friend," said the Prince of Tsusima, "and listen to me: after tonight's feast, as soon as she had returned to her flats, the divine Kisaki sent for me.
Farou," she said, "the Prince of Nagato is leaving Kioto tonight; I know that someone is out to get him, and that he may be ambushed.
So instead of the message he thinks he's carrying, I've only given him an empty envelope; the real letter is here," she added, showing me a small cassette. Take fifty men with you and follow the prince at a distance.
If not, meet him at the gate of Osaka and give him this cassette, leaving him unaware that you escorted him. Here you are, Prince; only you have incomparable horses, and we were too late in coming to your aid.
Nagato was deeply disturbed by this revelation; he remembered how kindly the sovereign had wished him a happy journey and could not help seeing a sign of interest in his life in what had happened. And then he thought that he was going to be able to keep this treasure, this letter that she had held over her heart for a whole evening.
The rest of the journey was silent. Nagato was seized by fever, the coolness of the coming dawn was making him shiver, and he was beginning to feel weakened by the loss of his blood.
By the time we reached the gates of Osaka, it was dawn.
Tsusima took from the saddle-tree a small crystal case, fastened with a skilfully tied silk cord.
- Here, Prince," he said, "the precious letter is locked in this box. I bid you farewell. May your wounds heal quickly!
- Goodbye," said Nagato, "thank you again for risking your precious life for mine, which is worth so little.
After waving goodbye to the small troop of horsemen, Nagato rode off under one of the city gates and, mounting his horse, soon reached the palace.
When Loo saw his master arrive, pale as a ghost and covered in blood, he fell to his knees and remained stupid with astonishment.
- Come on," said the prince, "shut your stunned mouth and get up; I'm not dead yet. Call my servants and run for the doctor.
VI
THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE BLIND
A few hours later, courtiers were gathered under the verandah of the palace of Hiéyas; they wanted to be the first to greet the true master and were waiting for him to wake up. Some of them were leaning against the cedar columns supporting the roof, others were standing proudly, one hand on their hip, ruffling the silky folds of their loose-fitting tunics. They listened attentively as one of them told an anecdote, which must have been very interesting, because it was listened to attentively and the listeners sometimes let out a burst of laughter, which was immediately stifled out of respect for the sleep of the illustrious sleeper.
The narrator was the Prince of Toza, and the Prince of Nagato the hero of the adventure he was recounting.
- Yesterday," he said, "the sun was about to set when I heard a noise at the door of my palace; I approached a window and saw my servants arguing with a group of blind men. The blind wanted to get in as fast as they could and were all talking at once, banging their sticks on the paving stones; the servants were shouting at them to get them out, and we couldn't hear each other at all. I was beginning to get irritated by this scene when I saw the Prince of Nagato arrive; my servants immediately bowed to him and, on his orders, let the blind men into the pavilion used to stable the visitors' horses. I went to meet the prince, curious to have the explanation of all this comedy.
- Let's hurry," he said, entering my room and throwing a parcel on the carpet, "let's take off our clothes and put on these costumes.
- What for?" I said, looking at the costumes, which were not to my taste.
- What!" he said, "isn't this the hour when we leave the dull pomp of our rank to become happy and free men again?
- Yes," he said, "but why use our freedom to dress up in these ungracious costumes?
- You'll see, I have a plan," said the prince, who was already undressing; then, coming close to my ear, he added:
- I'm getting married tonight. You'll see what a wedding it is!
- You're going to get married? And in that costume?
I exclaimed, seeing the prince dressed in a shabby suit.
- Come on, let's hurry," he said, "or we won't find the bride.
The prince was already coming down the stairs; I hastened to put on the garment similar to his and, piqued by curiosity, I followed him.
- But," I shouted, "what about all those blind people you had put in the stable?
- We're going to join them.
- In the stable?" I said.
I didn't understand a word of it; but I trust the prince's whimsical imagination, and I resigned myself to waiting to understand. The blind men had come out into the great courtyard of the palace, and I saw that we were dressed like them. These poor people had the most comical faces in the world, with their eyelashless eyelids, their squashed noses, their fat lips and their stupidly cheerful expressions. Nagato put a stick in my hand and shouted:
- Let's go!
The doors were opened. The blind men, holding each other by the flaps of their clothes, began to walk, tapping the ground with their sticks. Nagato, bending at the waist and closing his eyes, followed them. I knew I had to do the same, and I did my best. So here we were, following this band of blind men through the streets. I couldn't stand it. I was seized by a fit of giggles that all my companions soon shared.
- Nagato has definitely lost his mind!" cried Toza's listeners, bursting into laughter.
- It seems to me that Toza wasn't very sensible either!
- The Prince of Nagato wasn't laughing," continued the narrator, "he was very angry. I tried to find out from the blind man closest to me what the prince's plans were, but he didn't know. All I knew was that the guild I belonged to belonged to a brotherhood of blind men whose job it is to go into the homes of the little people and massage the weak and sick. I was beginning to get a vague idea of Nagato's intention. Under this grotesque disguise, he wanted to break into the home of an honest merchant. The idea that we might have someone to massage plunged me once again into such a fit of gaiety that, despite my efforts to keep a straight face in order to please the prince, I was forced to stop and sit down on a bollard to hold my ribs.
Nagato was furious.
- You're going to ruin my wedding," he said.
I set off again, blinking and imitating as closely as I could the gait of my strange colleagues. They struck the ground with their sticks, singing the well-known tune about their skill in the art of massaging, and at this noise people leaned out of their windows and called out to them. We arrived in front of an unremarkable house, and the noise of the sticks intensified. A voice called for two masseurs.
- Come," said Nagato; "it's here. Separating ourselves from the gang, we climbed a few steps and found ourselves inside the house. I saw two women, whom Nagato greeted awkwardly, turning his back to them. I hastily closed my eyes and waved at the wall. I opened one eye again, however, driven by curiosity. There was a young girl and an old woman there, her mother no doubt.
- Take care of us first," she said, "then massage my husband.
She immediately crouched down and uncovered her back. I realised that the old woman had come back to me and that I really should be a masseur. Nagato was full of greetings.
- Ah! ah! ah!" he said, as inferiors do when greeting a man of high rank.
I began to rub the old woman roughly, who was uttering pitiful moans. I made every effort to contain the laughter that once again rose to my throat and choked me. The young girl had modestly uncovered her shoulder, as if we'd had eyes.
- It's there," she said; "I gave myself a blow and the doctor said a few rubs would do me good.
Nagato began to massage the girl with astonishing seriousness, but suddenly he seemed to forget his role as a blind man.
- What beautiful hair you have! Of course, if you were to adopt the hairstyle of noble women, you wouldn't need to use the same tricks to make your hair longer.
The young girl shrieked and turned round; she saw Nagato's wide-open eyes looking at her.
- Mother," she cried, "these are false blind people!
The mother fell to the ground in a daze that robbed her of all her faculties, and she made no effort to get up.
The father ran over in fright.
I, on the other hand, had given free rein to my laughter and was rolling along the walls of the room, unable to stand it any longer. To my great surprise, the Prince of Nagato threw himself at the craftsman's feet.
Forgive us," he said, "your daughter and I wanted to get married together, and as I have no money I decided, as is customary, to kidnap her to avoid wedding expenses.
According to custom, you would have forgiven us after asking a little.
- Me, to marry that man!" said the young girl, "but I don't know him at all.
- Do you think my daughter would want a bandit like you for a husband? Come on! Get out of here as quickly as you can if you don't want to get to know my fists!
The sound of this angry voice began to draw a crowd to the front of the house. Nagato let out a long whistle.
- Will you leave!" cried the man of the people, red with anger.
And, in the midst of the coarsest insults, he raised his fist at Nagato.
- Don't hit the man who is to be your son," said the prince, raising his arm.
- You, my son? You'd rather see the snows of Fousi-Yama covered in flowers.
- I swear you'll be my father-in-law", said the prince, grabbing the man by the arm.
The man struggled, but Nagato carried him out of the house. I then approached the balustrade and saw the crowd gathered in front of the house move aside in front of the runners, who were leading a magnificent procession: music, banners, palanquins, all bearing the prince's arms. The norimonos stopped in front of the house and Nagato stuffed his father-in-law into one of them, locking it. I understood what had to be done, so I grabbed the old woman and put her in another palanquin, while Nagato came back to get the young girl. Two norimonos greet us and the procession sets off, the music blaring merrily. We soon arrived at a charming dwelling in the middle of the prettiest garden I have ever seen.
Everything is lit up, orchestras can be heard hidden in the foliage, and busy servants are running here and there.
What on earth is this lovely palace?" I said to Nagato.
- Oh nothing," he replies scornfully, "it's just a little house I bought for my new wife.
- He's mad, I thought, and he's going to ruin himself, but that's none of my business.
We were shown to a room, where we were dressed in splendid toiletries, and then down to the banqueting hall, where all Nagato's young friends, Sataké, Foungo, Aki and many others, had gathered. They greet us with extravagant cheers. Soon the bride, magnificently adorned, enters followed by her father and mother, who stumble in the folds of their silk garments. The father seems completely calm, the mother bewildered and the young girl so stunned that she holds her pretty mouth wide open. Nagato declares that he takes her as his wife and the wedding takes place. It was the happiest I've ever seen. The feast was most exquisite, and soon everyone was drunk, myself included; but I made myself go back to the palace at about three o'clock to rest, because I wanted to be at the regent's wake this morning.
- This story is the craziest I know," said the Prince of Figo. Only Nagato really knows how to run a joke.
- And did he really get married? asked another lord.
- Most certainly," said the Prince of Toza, "the marriage is valid, despite the despicable rank of the woman.
- Every day the prince invents new follies and throws splendid parties, and it is certain that his immense fortune will eventually run out.
- If he goes broke, that will please the Regent, who doesn't like him very much.
- Yes, but it will upset the siogoun who loves him very much and won't let him run out of money.
- Here!" exclaimed the Prince of Toza, "here's Nagato returning to the palace.
A procession did indeed pass through the gardens. On the banners, on the norimono carried by twenty men, could be seen the prince's arms: a black line surmounted by three pyramid-shaped balls. The procession passed quite close to the verandah housing the lords, and through the doors of the norimono they saw the young prince dozing on the cushions.
- He certainly won't come when the regent rises," said one lord, "he might fall asleep on Hiéyas' shoulder.
- Nagato never comes to greet Hiéyas, he hates him deeply, he's his declared enemy.
- Such an enemy is hardly to be feared, says the Prince of Toza. When he returns from his nocturnal follies, all he can do is sleep.
- I don't know if this is the regent's opinion.
- If he thought otherwise, would he put up with such insults that he would be condemned to hara-kiri?
[1] . If the prince is still alive, he owes it to the gentleness of Hiéyas.
- Or to the tender protection of Fidé-Yori.
- No doubt Hiéyas is magnanimous only for the sake of his master, but if he only had enemies like Nagato, he would count himself lucky.
While the courtiers talked and waited for him to wake up, Hiéyas, who had been up for a long time, was striding around his room, restless and restless, with traces of sleeplessness on his worried face.
A man was standing next to the regent, leaning against a wall; he was watching him come and go; this man was a former stable hand called Faxibo. Grooms had been held in fairly high esteem since the rise to power of Taïko-Sama, who was originally a groom. Faxibo enjoyed the confidence of the regent more than anyone else, who had nothing hidden from him and thought out loud in his presence.
Every so often, Hiéyas would raise the blind of a window and look out.
- Nothing," he would say impatiently, "no news, it's incomprehensible.
- Wait a few more moments," said Faxibo, "those you've just sent on the road to Kioto can't be back yet.
- But the others! there were forty of them and no one is coming back if they've escaped me again this time, it's driving me mad.
- Maybe you're exaggerating the importance of this man," says Faxibo. It's a love affair that's drawn him to Kioto; his head is full of madness.
- You believe that, and I confess that this man frightens me," said the regent forcefully, stopping in front of Faxibo: one claims that he followed him to Kioto, the other swears that he never lost sight of him for a moment and that he never left Osaka; all his friends had supper with him while he was fighting, on his way back from the Miako
[2] with men posted by me. They think he is asleep or busy with his love affairs; if one of my projects is going to be accomplished, his hand comes down on me at the last moment. For a long time the empire would have been ours without him; my supporters are numerous, but his are no less strong, and he has the law on his side. Now, this plan that I had so skilfully devised to rid the country, under the guise of an accident, of a sovereign without talent or energy, this plan that would have seen power fall into my hands, who aborted it? Who was the cursed coachman who launched this infernal carriage onto the bridge? Nagato! Always him. However," added Hiéyas, "someone else, one of my allies, must have betrayed me, because it is impossible for anything to have transpired from this project. Ah, if I knew the name of the traitor, I would at least give myself the pleasure of terrible revenge.
- I've told you what I've been able to find out," says Faxibo.
Fidé-Yori cried out as the building collapsed: "Omiti, you spoke the truth!
- Omiti! What is Omiti? I don't know that name.
The regent had gone into the room adjoining his bedroom, which was separated only by a large blind from the verandah where the lords were waiting for him to rise. From the inside, this blind made it possible to see without being seen. When Hiéyas heard Nagato's name being spoken, he approached quickly and beckoned Faxibo to come close to him. And so they heard the whole of the Prince of Toza's story.
- Yes," murmured Hiéyas, "for a long time I took him for a man of dissolute morals and no political importance, which is why at first I favoured his intimacy with Fidé-Yori; how I repent of this now that I know what he is worth!
- You see, master," said Faxibo, "that the prince, no doubt warned of your plan, has not left Osaka.
- I can tell you that he was at the Miako and didn't leave until well into the night.
- However, the Prince of Toza did not leave until very late.
- One of my spies followed him to Kioto, entering in broad daylight and not leaving until the middle of the night.
- It's incomprehensible," said Faxibo, "here he is, coming back," he added, catching sight of Nagato's retinue.
- Is that him in the litter?" said Hiéyas, trying to see.
- I thought I recognised him," said Faxibo.
- It's impossible, it can't be the Prince of Nagato, unless it's his corpse.
Just then, someone entered the room and bowed to the ground.
- It's my envoy," cried Hiéyas, who hurried back into the first room, "speak quickly; let's see, what have you learnt?" he said to the messenger.
- I have come to the point on the road that you have indicated to me, almighty master", said the envoy. At this point, the road is covered in dead men. I counted forty men and fifteen horses. Some peasants were grouped around the dead; they were feeling them to see if they had a breath of life left in them; others were chasing wounded horses that were running through the rice fields. I asked what had happened and was told they didn't know; however, at sunrise a troop of horsemen from the divine Mikado had been seen riding towards Kioto. As for the men who died on the road red with their blood, they were all wearing dark suits, without any insignia, and their faces were half-hidden by their headgear in the fashion of bandits and assassins.
- Enough!" cried Hiéyas, his eyebrows furrowed. Go away!
The envoy withdrew, or rather fled.
- He escaped me again this time," said Hiéyas. Well, I'll hit him myself; the goal I want to achieve is noble enough for me not to hesitate to use infamous means to overturn the obstacles that stand in my way.
Faxibo," he added, turning to the former groom, "send in those who are waiting. Perhaps their presence will dispel the sad forebodings that have obsessed me all night.
Faxibo raised the blind and the lords came in one by one to greet the master. Hiéyas noticed that there were fewer courtiers than usual, just the princes who were devoted to his cause and a few insouciants who wanted a special favour from the regent.
While chatting with the lords, Hiéyas stepped out onto the verandah and looked out.
It seemed to him that an unusual movement was filling the palace courtyards. Messengers were leaving at every moment and princes were arriving in their norimonos despite the early hour. They were all heading for the Fide-Yori palace.
- What's going on," he said, "what's all this commotion about, what are these messengers carrying orders I don't know anything about?
And full of concern, he dismissed the lords with a gesture.
- You will excuse me, won't you?" he said, "the interests of the country call me.
But before the princes had taken their leave, a soldier entered the room.
- The siogoun Fidé-Yori begs the illustrious Hiéyas to come to his presence at once," he said.
And, without waiting for a reply, he left.
Hiéyas stopped the lords ready to leave.
- Wait for me here," he said. "I don't know what's coming, but I'm worried sick. You are devoted to me and I may need you.
He greeted them with a gesture and left slowly, brow lowered, followed only by Faxibo.
VII
THE PARJURY
When he entered the room where Fidé-Yori was waiting for him, Hiéyas realised that something serious was about to happen.
All the supporters devoted to the son of Taïko-Sama were gathered in this room.
For the first time, Fidé-Yori was wearing the royal warrior costume that only he could wear. The black horn cuirass hugged his waist, and heavy basques made of strips linked by red silk stitches fell down over wide brocade trousers held from the ankle to the knees in velvet gaiters. He had a sabre on his left side and another on his right.
Three gold stars shone on his chest, and he rested his hand on an iron cane.
The young man was seated on a pliant like a warrior in a tent.
On his right was his mother, the beautiful Yodogimi, pale and worried, but splendidly dressed. On his left was the Prince of Mayada, who shared the regency with Hiéyas; but this very old prince, who had been ill for a long time, stayed away from business, but nevertheless kept an eye on Hiéyas and safeguarded Fidé-Yori's interests as far as possible.
On one side the princes: Satsouma, Sataké, Arima, Aki, Issida; on the other the warriors: General Sanada-Sayemon-Yoké-
Moura, in battle dress; other chiefs, Aroufza, Moto-
Tsoumou, Harounaga, Moritska and a very young man, as handsome as a woman and very serious, called Signénari.
All the young prince's friends and all the regent's mortal enemies were gathered together, but Nagato was absent.
Hiéyas glanced proudly at those present.
- Here I am," he said, "in a very firm voice, waiting: what do you want from me?
Only a deep silence answered him. Fidé-Yori looked away from him in horror.
Finally the Prince of Mayada spoke.
- Your mission, like mine, was completed several months ago, Hiéyas, and in your zeal to govern the empire you have not taken any notice of it. The son of Taïko-Sama is now old enough to reign; your reign is therefore over; all that remains is for you to lay your powers at the feet of the master and give him an account of your conduct, just as I will give him an account of my actions while he was under our tutelage.
- You don't think about what you're saying," cried Hiéyas, whose face flushed with anger; "you apparently want to drive the country to ruin?
- I spoke gently," continued Mayada, "don't force me to take a different tone.
- You want an inexperienced child," continued Hiéyas, heedless of the interruption, "to come and take power in his own hands before he has practised the formidable profession of ruling a kingdom; it's as if you put a heavy porcelain vase in the hands of a new-born baby: he'll drop it on the ground and the vase will shatter into a thousand pieces.
- You insult our siogoun!" cried the Prince of Sataké.
- No," said Hieyas, "Fidé-Yori himself will agree with me. I must involve him slowly in my work and show him the possible solutions to the pending questions. Did he ever concern himself with the affairs of the country? His young intelligence was not yet mature, and I was able to spare him the troubles of government. I alone have the great Taiko's instructions and I alone can continue the gigantic work he has undertaken. The work is not yet complete. Therefore, in order to obey this revered leader, I must, despite your advice, retain in my own hands the power entrusted to me by him; only, to show you how much I heed your advice, from today the young Fidé-Yori will take part in the serious occupations whose burden I have borne alone until now. Answer, Fidé-Yori," added Hiéyas; "proclaim to yourself that I have spoken from your heart.
Fidé-Yori slowly turned his very pale face towards Hiéyas and stared at him.
Then, after a moment's silence, he said in a voice that was a little shaky but full of contempt:
- The sound of the Swallow's bridge collapsing before my feet has made me deaf to your voice. Hiéyas paled in the presence of the man he had tried to drive to his death; he was humiliated by his crime. He saw them in the future darkening his name, which he wanted to be glorious, certain that his duty to his country was to keep in his hands the power of which he was more worthy than any other; he felt a kind of anger at being obliged to impose by force what the public interest should have urged him to do. However, determined to fight to the bitter end, he raised his head, bent for a moment under the weight of tumultuous thoughts, and cast his wild, domineering gaze over the audience.
A menacing silence followed the siogoun's words. The Prince of Satsouma finally broke it.
- Hiéyas," he said, "I summon you in the name of my master to deposit the powers vested in you by Taïko-Sama.
- I refuse," said Hiéyas.
A cry of astonishment escaped the lips of all the lords.
The Prince of Mayada rose to his feet; he walked slowly towards Hiéyas and drew from his chest a paper yellowed by time.
- Do you recognise this?" he said, unfolding the document and placing it in front of Hiéyas' eyes. "Is it with your blood that you have drawn your traitorous name alongside my loyal name? Have you forgotten the words of the oath: "The powers you entrust to us, we will return to your child when he comes of age, we swear on the spirits of our ancestors, before the luminous disc of the sun? Taïko fell asleep peacefully after seeing these few red lines; today he will rise from his tomb, perjurer, to curse you.
The old man, trembling with anger, crumpled the oath written in blood between his hands and threw it in Hiéyas' face.
- But do you really think we're going to let you rob our child before our very eyes? Do you think that just because you don't want to give back what you've taken, we won't take you back? The crimes you meditate on have clouded your intelligence, you no longer have any soul or honour, you dare to stand up before your master, before the one you wanted to kill!
- It's not just me whose life he wants to snatch," said Fidé-Yori; "this man, more ferocious than a tiger, last night had my most faithful servant, my dearest friend, the Prince of Nagato, murdered.
A shiver of horror ran through the assembly as a flash of joy passed through Hiéyas' eyes.
- With this formidable adversary out of the way," he thought, "I'll have no trouble getting the better of Fidé-Yori.
As if in response to his thought, Nagato's voice was heard.
- Don't rejoice too quickly, Hiéyas," she said, "I'm still alive and able to serve my young master.
Hiéyas turned round sharply and saw the prince lifting a drapery and entering the room.
Nagato looked like a ghost, his eyes glowing with the fire of fever and appearing larger and blacker than usual. His face was so pale that one could barely make out the thin white bandage, stained with a few drops of blood, that clung to his forehead. A painful shiver shook his limbs and caused a crystal box to tremble in his hand.
General Yoké-Moura ran to him.
- After losing so much blood, and despite the doctors' orders, you get up and walk!
- Bad friend," said Fide-Yori, "will you not stop playing with your life?
- I will become the slave of the doctors to obey your undeserved interest in me," said the prince, "when I have accomplished the mission with which I have been charged.
He watched and waited, often glancing towards the door as if he wanted to flee.
- I must present this box to you on my knees, and you must receive it on your knees," said the prince, "for it contains a message from your lord and ours, from the one who holds his power from heaven, the almighty Mikado.
Nagato prostrated himself and handed the cassette to the siogun, who received it by bending the knee.
Hiéyas was well aware that this cassette contained his definitive doom, and he thought that, as always, it was the prince of Nagato who had triumphed over him.
However, Fidé-Yori had unfolded the Mikado's message and was looking through it. An expression of joy lit up his face.
He looked up at Nagato with wet eyes, thinking in turn that it was always through him that he triumphed.
- Prince of Satsouma," he said shortly, handing the letter to the old lord, "read this divine writing aloud to us.
The Prince of Satsouma read out the following:
"I, the direct descendant of the gods who founded Japan, look down upon your land and see that time has passed since the death of the faithful servant of my dynasty, Taïko- Sama, whom my predecessor, the King of Satsouma, had killed.
Sama, whom my predecessor had appointed as the chief gêneral of the kingdom. The son of this illustrious chief, who rendered great services to the country, was six years old when his father died; but time has passed for him as it has for everyone else, and he is now of an age to succeed his father, which is why I am appointing him in his turn chief general of the kingdom.
"In a few days' time, men from heaven will go and solemnly announce my wishes to him, so that no one will be unaware of them.
"Now, resting on Fide-Yori to govern, I plunge back into the mysterious absorption of my extra-human dream.
dream.
"Done at the Dairi, in the nineteenth year of Nengo-Kai-Tio [] .
"Go-MiTzou-No."
There is nothing to say in reply to this," said Hiéyas, bowing his head, "the sovereign master has ordered, I obey, I lay down the powers that have been entrusted to me and after the insults I have suffered, I know what I have to do. I hope that those who led this affair will not one day repent of having seen it succeed, and that the country will not have to groan under the weight of the calamities that may befall it.
He went out after saying these words, and all the happy lords crowded around the young Siogoun and congratulated him.
- It's my friend, my brother Nagato, who should be congratulated," said Fidé-Yori, "it's he who has done everything.
- It's not all over yet," said Nagato, who looked worried, "we need to sign Hiéyas' death sentence straight away.
- But you heard him, friend? he said he knew what he had to do, he's carrying out the Hara-Kiri right now.
- That's for sure," says the Prince of Satsouma.
- He knows the code of the nobility," said the Prince of Aki.
- Yes, but he despises its customs and won't abide by it," said Nagato. If we don't condemn this man quickly he will escape us, and once free he is capable of daring anything.
The prince of Nagato had unfurled a roll of white paper and was holding out a brush dipped in ink to the siogun.
Fidé-Yori seemed to hesitate.
- To condemn him like this without a trial! he said.
- There's no need for a trial," Nagato said in front of the whole council, "he's just perjured himself and disrespected you, and what's more he's a murderer.
- He's my wife's grandfather," murmured the Siogun.
- You will repudiate your wife," said Nagato. With Hiéyas alive, there's no peace for you, no security for the country.
Fidé-Yori suddenly picked up a paintbrush, wrote down the sentence and signed.
Nagato handed the order to General Sanada-Sayemon-Yoké-
Moura, who left immediately.
He soon returned, his face flushed with anger.
- Too late," he cried, "the Prince of Nagato was only too right: Hiéyas is on the run.
VIII
OVARI CASTLE
On the shores of the Pacific Ocean, atop a rocky hill, stands the fortress of the Princes of Ovari. Its walls, pierced with loopholes, follow the sinuosities of the terrain. They are masked here and there by groups of trees and bushes whose fresh greenery contrasts happily with the torn walls of rust-coloured rock. In the distance, a square tower rises up, its base widening like the foot of a pyramid; a roof with raised edges covers it.
The view from the top of the fortress is admirable. In the distance, the blue waves of the Pacific Ocean unfurl and trace a rigid, darker blue line on the horizon. On the land side, the first undulations of a mountain range dent the ground; moss-covered rocks dot it, and the high hills are in places cultivated right up to their summits. From one mountain to the next, a valley deepens, revealing a village hidden in the shade of a small wood, close to a stream, then at the end new hills close off the valley.
A wide, well-maintained road runs between the landslides and passes at the foot of Ovari castle. This road, known as the Tokaido, was built by Taïko-Sama; it criss-crosses the entire empire, passing through the domains of the Daïmios and is subject only to the jurisdiction of the siogoun.
The prince who reigned over the province of Ovari resided in his castle.
Around the third hour after noon, on the day that Hiéyas fled from Osaka, the sentry on the highest tower of the Ovari palace shouted that he saw a troop of horsemen galloping along the Tokaïdo. The prince was at that moment in one of the courtyards of the castle, crouching on his heels, hands resting on his thighs; he was watching a Hara-Kiri lesson being given by his young son.
The child was sitting on a mat in the middle of the courtyard, holding an unsharpened short sword in both hands and raising his pretty, naive but already serious face towards his instructor, seated opposite him. Women were watching from the top of a gallery, their dresses making cheerful spots on the light colours of the carved woodwork; huge butterflies were embroidered on their dresses, or birds, flowers or multicoloured discs, all their heads bristling with large blond tortoiseshell pins. They cackled to each other with a thousand charming minces.
In the courtyard, leaning against the support of a bronze lantern, a young girl, tightly clad in a sky-blue crepe dress, all the folds of which were thrown forward, fixed her distracted gaze on the little lord; in her hand was a screen with a hummingbird painted on it.
- Hold the sword vigorously," said the instructor, "press the point
the point below the ribs on the left side, making sure that the edge of the blade is turned to the right. Now hold the hilt tightly in your hand and press down with all your might, then quickly, without ceasing to press down, bring the weapon back horizontally towards your right side, in this way you will split your body according to the rules.
The child executed the movement so violently that he tore his clothes.
- Good! good!" exclaimed the Prince of Ovari, slapping his thighs with his open hands.
At the same time, he looked up at the women leaning out of the gallery and nodded to them.
- He'll be brave and intrepid like his father," said one of them.
It was then that the Prince was informed that a group of horsemen had appeared on the royal road.
- No doubt a neighbouring lord is visiting me incognito", said the prince, "or perhaps these horsemen are simply travellers passing through; in any case there was no reason to interrupt the lesson.
The instructor then enumerated for his pupil the events that oblige a man of noble race to cut open his stomach: having incurred the disgrace of the siogoun, or having received a public reprimand from him, having been dishonoured, having avenged an insult by murder, having voluntarily or involuntarily let prisoners entrusted to your guard escape, and a thousand other delicate cases.
- Add to this," said the Prince of Ovari, "having shown disrespect for his father. In my opinion, a son who insults his parents can only atone for this crime by performing Hara-Kiri.
At the same time, he gave the women another look which meant that it was a good idea to instil in children the terror of their father's authority.
At that moment, a great noise of horses stampeding on the flagstones was heard in a neighbouring courtyard, and an imperious voice shouted:
- Raise the drawbridges! Close the gates!
The Prince of Ovari jumped to his feet:
- Who's in charge here?
- It's me!" replied the same voice.
At the same time, a group of men entered the second courtyard.
- The Regent!" exclaimed the Prince of Ovari, bowing.
- Get up, friend," said Hiéyas with a bitter smile, "I no longer have the right to the honours you pay me, I am, for the moment, your equal.
- What's going on?" asked the prince worriedly.
- Dismiss your wives," said Hiéyas.
Ovari made a sign and the women disappeared.
- Take your brother with you, Omiti," he said to the young girl who had gone terribly pale when Hiéyas entered.
- Your daughter's name is Omiti?" exclaimed the latter, whose face suddenly flushed.
Yes, master. Why do you ask?
- Please call her back.
Ovari obeyed. The young girl returned trembling, her eyes downcast.
Hiéyas stared at her with a facial expression that was frightening for anyone who knew the man. The girl raised her head, however, and you could see in her eyes an invincible fearlessness, a kind of renunciation of self and of life.
- It was you who betrayed us," said Hiéyas in a dull voice.
- Yes," she said.
- What does this mean?" exclaimed the Prince of Ovari, jerking back.
- It means that the plot so well hatched behind the walls of this castle, so mysteriously concealed from everyone, she has surprised and revealed.
- Wretch!" exclaimed the prince, raising his fist at his daughter.
- A woman, a child, thwarting a political project! A vile stone that trips you up and sends you tumbling to the ground, that's derisory!
- I'll kill you," shouted Ovari.
- Kill me, I don't care," said the young girl, "I've saved the king. Isn't his life worth mine? I've waited a long time for your vengeance.
- You won't have to wait much longer," said the prince, grabbing her by the throat.
- No, don't kill her," said Hiéyas; "I'll see to her torture.
- All right," said Ovari, "I'll leave her in your hands.
- Good," said Hiéyas, who signalled Faxibo not to let the young girl out of his sight. But let's put the past behind us and look to the future. Are you still devoted to me?
- Can you doubt it, master? And must I not now right the wrong done to you by one of my own without my knowledge?
- Listen, then, a plot has just snatched power from me. I escaped the death that awaited me and fled to my principality of Micava. Your domains lie between Osaka and my province, your fortress overlooks the sea and can block the path of soldiers coming from Osaka, which is why I stopped here to tell you to assemble your troops as quickly as possible and put the country in a state of defence. Close the fortified castle. I will stay here where I am safe from attack, while my faithful companion Ino-
Kamo-No-Kami (Hiéyas pointed to a lord in his retinue, who bowed deeply to the Prince of Ovari, who returned his greeting)
will reach Micava castle, fortify the whole province and give the alarm to all the princes who are my allies.
- I am your slave, master dispose of me.
- So give your soldiers their orders straight away.
The Prince of Ovari left.
Servants ushered their master's guests into cool, airy rooms, where they were served tea, sweets and a light meal.
Ino-Kamo-No-Kami soon took leave of Hiéyas, who gave him his final instructions, and taking with him two of the lords who had accompanied them, he mounted his horse and left the castle.
Hiéyas called Faxibo.
Faxibo was busy devouring a honey cake, while keeping his eyes on Omiti, who was sitting in a corner of the room.
- Could you disguise yourself so well that you wouldn't be recognised?
- To the point where you yourself wouldn't recognise me," said Faxibo.
- Well, tomorrow morning you'll go back to Osaka and make sure you know what's going on at the palace.
Besides, you'll be travelling with a woman.
Hiéyas leaned close to the ear of the former groom and spoke softly.
Faxibo smiled evilly.
- Good! good! he said, tomorrow at daybreak I'll be ready to leave.
IX
THE TEA HOUSE
In one of the suburbs of Osaka, not far from the beach that lets the smooth slope of its white sand slide down to the sea, stretched a vast building whose roofs, of unequal heights, exceeded the level of the surrounding dwellings. The front of this house opened wide onto a crowded street, always crowded and full of uproar.
The first floor had large windows closed by brightly coloured blinds, which were frequently pushed forward by curious young women, whose bursts of laughter could be heard.
Banners and large diamond-shaped lanterns hung from the corners of the roofs, and the ground floor consisted of a wide gallery opening onto the street and protected by a roof. Three large black characters on a gilded panel formed the sign of the establishment, which read as follows: À l'aurore.
Tea and sake.
Towards mid-day the gallery was crowded with customers; they sat with their legs bent on the mat covering the floor, drinking sake or hiding their faces in the cloud of steam rising from the cup of tea they were blowing on. Coquettishly dressed women, carefully adorned, move gracefully between the groups, carrying the hot drink. In the background you can see the steaming ovens and pretty china arranged on red lacquer shelves.
Every now and then, passers-by, canoe-bearers and men laden with loads stop for a moment, ask for a drink and then leave.
Sometimes an argument breaks out in front of the inn and degenerates into a fight, much to the delight of the customers.
Here is a hawker who has just collided with a seller of octopus and shellfish, the basket containing the fish is overturned and the whole catch, soiled with dust, lies on the ground.
Insults rain down from both sides, traffic is interrupted, the crowd gathers or takes sides with one or the other of the adversaries, and soon the two camps are ready to come to blows.
But those present shouted from all sides: The cable! the cable! no fighting; go and get a cable.
A few people ran away, entered several houses and finally found what they were looking for; they returned with a thick rope.
The spectators then line up alongside the houses, leaving the place free for those who want to fight. They grab the rope with both hands, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other, and start pulling with all their might. The rope stretches, shudders, then remains motionless.
- Courage! stand firm! don't falter! they shouted from all sides.
However, after a long struggle against fatigue, one of the parties suddenly gives up the rope. The victors fell simultaneously, one on top of the other, their legs in the air, amid shouts and laughter from the crowd.
Nevertheless, they are rescued and helped to their feet, and the reconciliation of the two enemy camps is sealed with sake libations.
The inn is overrun, and the maids don't know what to do.
Just then, an old man holding a young girl by the hand manages to stop one of the inn's maids in her tracks and hold her by her sleeve.
- I'd like to speak to the owner," he says.
- You've chosen the right moment," said the maid, bursting into laughter.
With a sudden gesture, she disengaged herself and walked away without listening to the old man.
- I'll wait," he said.
A barrel of sake was smashed and the happy drinkers chatted and laughed loudly.
Suddenly there was silence, the clear sound of a flute and the vibrations of a stringed instrument. This music comes from the flats above.
- Listen! listen!
A few passers-by stopped and listened.
A woman's voice is heard. The words of the song were clearly distinguishable.
"When Iza-Na-Gui had descended to earth, his companion, Iza-Na-Mi, met him in a garden.
"How wonderful to see such a handsome young man!
she exclaimed.
"But the god, displeased, replied:
"It is not fitting that the woman should have spoken first. Come back and meet me.
"They parted and met again.
What a pleasure to meet such a pretty girl!" said Iza-Na-Gui.
"Which of the two spoke first?
The voice fell silent. The accompaniment continued for a few moments.
A discussion began among the drinkers. They were answering the question posed by the singer.
- Some said it was the god who was greeted first.
- No! no! it was the goddess, cried the others. The god's will cancelled the first greeting.
- Did he cancel it? - No doubt! No doubt! They started again as if nothing had happened.
- Which doesn't change the fact that what was was, and that the woman was the first to speak.
The discussion threatened to escalate, but ended with more cups being emptied. Soon the crowd thinned out and the inn became peaceful again.
Then a maid spotted the old man leaning against a pillar, holding the young girl by the hand.
- Would you like some tea or sake?
- I want to speak to the head of the house," said the man. The maid glanced at the old man. He had a large woven rush hat on his head, like the lid of a round basket; his costume was made of brown cotton and was very worn; he was holding a fan in his hand on which was written the route from Yedo to Osaka, the distance from one village to the next, and the number and size of the inns. The maid looked at the young girl. She was poorly dressed. Her dress, a faded blue, was torn and dirty. A piece of white cloth, wrapped around her head, half hid her forehead. She was leaning on a black and pink parasol, the paper of which had been torn away here and there; but this young girl was singularly beautiful and graceful.
- Have you come for a sale?" said the innkeeper.
The old man nodded.
- I'll tell the master.
She left and soon returned. The master followed her.
He was a man of repulsive ugliness: his small, black, squinty eyes could barely be seen between the narrow fissure of his ridiculously slit eyelids; his mouth, set far back from a long, angular nose, bereft of teeth and topped with a few sparse, stiff hairs, gave a pitiful, sly expression to his pox-ridden face.
- Do you want to get rid of that little girl?" he said, rolling one of his eyes, while the other disappeared into the corner of his nose.
- Get rid of my child," cried the old man. I only want to part with her to keep her out of misery.
- Unfortunately, I have more wives than I need, and all of them are at least as pretty as this one.
My house is complete.
- I'll look elsewhere," said the old man, pretending to leave.
- Don't be in such a hurry," said the man, "if your demands aren't exorbitant we can come to an agreement.
- He beckoned her to follow him into the room at the entrance to which he was standing; this room, which opened onto a garden, was deserted.
- What can the little girl do?" said the dreadful squint.
- She can embroider, she can sing and play several instruments; she can even compose a quatrain.
- And what price do you want?
- Four kobangs.
The innkeeper was about to exclaim "No more", but he held back.
- That's what I was going to offer you," he said.
- Well, it's agreed," said the old man; "I'll rent it to you for whatever you want to do with it for twenty years.
The buyer hurried off to fetch a roll of paper and some paintbrushes; he drew up the contract, which the old man signed without hesitation.
The young girl remained like a statue, not glancing at the old man who pretended to wipe away a tear as he pocketed the kobangs.
Before leaving, he leaned towards the innkeeper's ear and said:
- Watch out for her, she'll try to escape.
Then he left the Teahouse of the Dawn, and anyone who, when he turned the corner of the street, had seen him change his steps, rubbing his hands together and passing the most alert, might have suspected the authenticity of his old age and white beard.
X
THE APPOINTMENT
The Prince of Nagato is lying on a black satin mattress, pressing one of his elbows into a cushion and handing over his other arm to a doctor crouched beside him.
The doctor felt his pulse.
At the Prince's bedside, Fidé-Yori, sitting on a pile of braids, fixes his worried gaze on the doctor's crumpled but inscrutable face.
A huge pair of glasses, with round lenses framed in black, gave a strange and comical expression to the serious face of the respectable scientist.
Near the entrance to the room, Loo was kneeling, his forehead bent towards the floor because of the King's presence; he was amusing himself by counting the strands of silver that fringed the carpet.
- The danger is over," says the doctor at last, "the wounds are closed, and yet the fever persists for a reason I cannot explain.
- I'll explain it to you," said the prince, quickly withdrawing his arm, "it's the impatience of being confined to this bed and not being able to run freely in the open air.
- How, friend," said the Siogun, "when I myself have come to share your captivity, are you so impatient to be free?
- You know very well, dear lord, that it is for your service that I am anxious to leave; the departure of the embassy you are sending to Kioto cannot be delayed indefinitely.
- Why did you ask me as a favour to be the head of this embassy?
- Is it not my happiness to serve you?
- That's not your only motive," said Fide-Yori, smiling.
- You're alluding to my supposed love for Fatkoura," thought Nagato, who also smiled.
- If the prince is reasonable, if he puts an end to this over-excitement that's exhausting him, he'll be able to leave in three days," said the doctor.
- Thank you!" exclaimed Nagato, "this is better than all your drugs.
- My drugs are not to be sneezed at," said the doctor, "and you'll still take the one I'm going to send you.
Then he bowed deeply to the king and his noble patient and withdrew.
- Ah!" exclaimed Fide-Yori when he was alone with his friend, "your impatience to leave proves to me that I was not deceived; you are in love, Ivakoura, you are loved, you are happy!
And he let out a long, deep sigh.
The prince looked at him, surprised by this sigh and expecting a confidence, but the young man blushed a little and changed the conversation.
You see," he said, opening a volume he was holding in his lap, "I'm studying the Book of Laws, trying to see if it doesn't need to be refined and softened.
- It contains an article that I advise you to remove," said Nagato.
- Which article is that?
- The one about mutual suicide for love.
- What does it say?" said Fidé-Yori, leafing through the book.
Ah, here it is: "When two lovers swear to die together and slit their stomachs open, their corpses are seized by the law.
If one of them is not mortally wounded, he is treated as the murderer of the other. If both survive their suicide attempt, they are placed in the ranks of the reprobate."
- It's iniquitous," says Nagato, "don't we have the right to escape too much pain by dying?
- There is one religion that says no," murmured Fidé-Yori.
- That of the bonzes of Europe! the one whose doctrine you have embraced, according to public rumour," said Nagato, trying to read his friend's eyes.
- I have studied this doctrine, Ivakoura," said the siogun, "it is touching and pure and the priests who teach it are full of self-denial. While our monks seek only to enrich themselves, these priests despise riches. And then, you see, I cannot forget the terrible scene I once witnessed, nor the sublime courage of the Christians undergoing the horrible tortures my father had them subjected to. When I was a child, I was made to watch them being tortured to teach me, it was said, how to treat these people. It was near Nakasaki, on the hill. That nightmare will always trouble my nights. So many crosses were planted on the slopes that the hill seemed to be covered with a forest of dead trees. Among the victims, whose noses and ears had been cut off, were three young children, I can still see them, disfigured and bloody, who showed a strange fearlessness in the face of death. All the unfortunates were tied to crosses and their bodies were pierced with spears; the blood trickled down, but the victims did not complain; as they died, they prayed to heaven to forgive their executioners. Those present let out horrific cries, and I, frightened, screamed with them and hid my face on the chest of the Prince of Mayada, who held me in his arms; soon, despite the soldiers who pushed them back and struck them with their spears, the spectators of this horrible scene rushed up the hill to fight over some of the relics of these martyrs, which they left naked on the crosses.
As he spoke, the siogun continued to leaf through the book.
- Precisely", he said with a movement of fright, "here is the edict issued by my father ordering the massacre:
"I, Taïko-Sama, have condemned these men to death, because they came to Japan, claiming to be ambassadors, even though they were not; because they stayed on my lands without my permission, and preached the law of the Christians, contrary to my defence. I want them crucified in Nakasaki".
Fidé-Yori tore out this page and some following pages containing laws against Christians.
- I've found what needs to be taken out of this book," he said.
- You do well, master, to protect these gentle and harmless men," said Nagato, "but take care that the rumour that spreads from mouth to mouth and accuses you of being a Christian does not take hold and that your enemies do not use it against you.
- You are right, friend, I will wait until my power is firmly established before declaring my feelings and redeeming as much as I can the blood spilt before my eyes. But I am going to leave you, dear sick man, you are getting tired and the doctor has ordered you to rest. Have patience, your convalescence is coming to an end.
The siogoun left, giving his friend an affectionate look.
As soon as he had left, Loo finally got to his feet; he yawned, stretched and made a thousand faces.
- Come on, Loo," said the prince, "go and run around the gardens for a while, but don't throw stones at the gazelles or frighten my Chinese ducks.
Loo ran off.
When he was alone, the prince drew a letter from under his bedside table, enclosed in a green satin pouch; he placed it on his pillow, leaned his cheek against it and closed his eyes to sleep.
This envelope was the one given to him by Kisaki; he kept it like a treasure, and his only joy was to breathe in its light perfume. But, much to his chagrin, it seemed to him that for some days that scent had been evaporating; perhaps, being used to breathing it in, he no longer smelt it as keenly.
Suddenly, the prince sat up straight, thinking that inside the envelope, this subtle, delicious fragrance had no doubt been better preserved. He broke the seal, which he had not yet touched, thinking that the envelope was empty, but to his great surprise he pulled out a piece of paper covered in writing.
He shrieked and tried to read, but to no avail. A red veil shivered before his eyes and blood whistled in his ears; he was afraid of fainting and rested his head on the pillow. He managed to calm himself, however, and looked again at the writing. It was an elegantly combined quatrain. The prince read it with unspeakable emotion:
"Two flowers bloom on the banks of a stream.
But, alas, the stream separates them.
"In each corolla there is a dewdrop, the shining soul of the flower.
"The sun strikes one of them. It makes it shine. But she thinks: why am I not on the other side?
"One day, these flowers will bend down to die. They will let their luminous souls fall like diamonds. Then the two dewdrops will meet and merge.
- She's giving me a rendezvous," exclaimed the prince, "further on, later, in the next life. So she has guessed my love! So she loves me! O death, could you not make haste? could you not bring forward the heavenly hour of our reunion?
The prince thought he had been granted his wish, for he fell back on the cushions and lost consciousness.
XI
THE WARRIOR QUAILS
In a lovely landscape in the middle of a dense wood, the Kisaki's summer residence raises its pretty golden roofs.
The thick foliage of the prodigiously tall trees seems to recede reluctantly to make way for these brilliant roofs, which project all around the palace and shelter a wide verandah whose floor is covered with carpets and strewn with cushions of silk and satin embroidered with gold.
The view does not extend very far and the dwelling is as if enclosed by the freshly transparent vegetation. Slender emerald-coloured reeds float like streamers, their narrow leaves seeming to want to detach themselves from the stems and erect a silvery, fluffy plume.
Orange bushes blossom near the tall bamboo trees, their fragrant flowers mingling with the red blossoms of the wild cherry trees. Further on, huge camellias climb the trees; at their feet, broad red leaves covered with a fine down spread out next to tall heathers so delicate and light that they look like tufts of green feathers. Above this first layer of greenery, the palms, banana trees, oaks and cedars intertwine their branches to form an inextricable network through which the light filters, tinted with a thousand shades.
A stream glides slowly over a bed of thick moss, its flowing crystal slightly disturbed by a moorhen, with its charming plumage, which brushes against it as it pursues a dragonfly, whose slender body throws out shards of metal.
But more than the surrounding flowers, more than the velvet of the moss and the silvery gleam of the stream, the dress of the women occupying the verandah is brilliant and splendid.
The Kisaki, surrounded by her favourite wives and a few young lords, the noblest of the court, is watching a quail fight.
Because of the heat, the sovereign wears a light dress made of silk gauze the colour of mountain pigeon, a shade of green that only she can wear. Instead of the three golden blades of her crown, she has placed three daisies with silver petals on her hair. Above her left ear, from the head of a long pin stuck in her hair, hangs from the end of a gold chain a large pearl of rare beauty and perfectly round.
The Kisaki, leaning over the balustrade, is attentively watching the fierce battle between two quails that have already been fighting for a long time.
Two young boys, dressed in a similar costume that differs in colour, are crouching on their heels opposite each other, watching the duel of the pretty birds, ready to raise the dead and bring in new combatants.
- How little chance I have of winning," says a lord with a witty face, "I who have dared to bet against my sovereign!
- You're the only one who's had the audacity, Simabara," said the Kisaki, "but if you win, I'm sure that at the next battle, everyone will bet against me.
- He could well win," said the Prince of Tsusima, husband of the beautiful Iza-Farou-No-kami.
- How," cried the Kisaki, "am I so close to losing?
- Look, your champion is weakening.
- Courage, courage, little warrior! said the queen.
The quails, their feathers ruffled and their necks extended, stopped for a moment, looking at each other motionless, then darted forward again.
One of them fell.
- Ah, it's all over," cried the Kisaki, rising to her feet, "she's dead!
Simabara has won.
Young girls brought sweets and treats of all kinds, and tea from the nearby mountains, and the games stopped for a moment.
Then a page approached the Kisaki and told her that a messenger had been here for a few minutes, bringing news from the palace.
- Let him come", said the sovereign.
The messenger came forward and bowed.
- Speak," said the Kisaki.
- Light of the world", said the man, "the embassy of the Siogun has arrived.
- Ah," said the Kisaki quickly. And which princes are in it?
- The princes of Nagato, Satsouma, Ouésougui and Sataké.
- Good," said the Kisaki, gesturing to dismiss the messenger. These lords will be bored waiting for the day of the audience," she continued, addressing the princes gathered around her. "The Mikado, my divine master, is with all his wives and his entire court at the summer palace; the dairi is more or less deserted. Tsusima, go and fetch these princes and bring them here, so they can take part in our games. Have some pavilions prepared for them within the walls of the residence," she added, turning to her wives.
The orders were passed on inside the house, and the Prince of Tsusima, after bowing deeply, left.
The dairi was only half an hour's walk from the summer palace, so it would take an hour to get there and back.
- Prepare for another battle," said the Kisaki.
The birds called out the names of the combatants:
- The Golden Ergot!
- The Lightning Rival!
- The Golden Ergot is an unknown," said the sovereign; "my money's on the Lightning Rival; I think he's invincible.
de-Corail, who had slaughtered many of his opponents.
All those present bet with the queen.
- If that's the way it is," she said, laughing, "I'll bet alone against all of you; I'll join in the fortune of the Golden Ergot.
The fight began: the Lightning Rival dashed forward with the vivacity that had earned him his name. Usually, at the first impact, he would knock his opponent out of the fight, but this time he stepped back, leaving a few feathers in the beak of his antagonist, who had not been hit.
- Good! good!" cried everyone, "the Ergot d'Or is off to a marvellous start?
A few lords crouched on their heels to follow the fight more closely.
The birds came together a second time. But then nothing was seen but a confused ruffle of quivering feathers, then the Lightning Rival fell with a bloodied head, and the Ergot-
proudly placed one of his paws on the body of his vanquished foe.
- Victory!" cried the Kisaki, clapping her small milk-coloured hands together. The Golden Ergot is the king of the day, he's the one who gets the collar of honour.
One of the princesses fetched a black lacquer screen containing a gold ring enriched with rubies and coral, from which hung a small crystal bell.
The winner was brought to the queen, who took the ring between her fingers and placed it around the bird's neck.
Other battles took place, but the Kisaki, who was singularly distracted, hardly paid any attention to them; she was listening to the thousand shivers of the forest, and seemed irritated by the chirping of the stream, which prevented her from distinctly perceiving a very faint and distant noise. Perhaps it was the light clash of sabres passed through a lord's belt, the crunching of the sand in the paths under numerous footsteps, the sudden snap of a fan being bent and unfurled.
An insect or a passing bird would blur this barely perceptible sound.
However, it soon became clearer; everyone heard it. Murmurs of voices mingled with it.
- Here are the ambassadors," said Simabara.
Shortly afterwards, we heard the clanking of the weapons that the princes were stripping off before appearing before the sovereign.
Tsusima stepped forward from inside the house and announced the noble envoys, who in turn appeared and bowed before the Kisaki.
- Stand up," said the young woman, "and learn the laws that govern our little Court of Flowers. Ceremonial etiquette is banished, and I am regarded as an elder sister. Everyone is free and at ease and has no other occupation than imagining new distractions; here the watchword is gaiety.
The lords rose to their feet, were surrounded and questioned about the recent events in Osaka.
The Kisaki cast a quick glance at the Prince of Nagato; she was struck by the look of weakness in the young man's whole person; but she noticed a strange radiance of pride and joy in his eyes.
- He has read the verses I gave him, she thought. Am I mad to have written that!
But she beckoned him to come closer.
- Imprudent," she said to him, "why did you set off so weak, so ill again?
- You have deigned to protect my life, divine queen," said the prince, "could I delay any longer in coming to show you my humble gratitude?
- It is true that my foresight has saved you from death, but has not succeeded in preserving you from terrible wounds," said the queen; "it seems that all your blood has run out of your veins. You are as pale as these jasmine flowers.
She showed him a blossoming branch that she held between her fingers.
- You must have suffered a lot," she added.
- Ah, may I confess to you," cried Nagato, "that for me physical pain is a relief: there's another, more poignant wound, the one I'm dying of, which doesn't give me any rest.
- Why," said the Kisaki, hiding her deep emotion in a smile, "is this how you comply with my wishes? Have
have you not heard that only gaiety reigns here? Speak no more of death or sadness, let your soul relax amidst the fragrance of this beautiful and invigorating nature. If you spend a few days here, you'll see what a charming country life we lead in this retreat. Our simplicity rivals that of our ancestors, the shepherds, who were the first to pitch their tents on this soil. Iza-Farou", she continued, calling out to the princess who was passing in front of the house, "I want to hear some stories, call our companions back and put an end to their political conversation.
Soon all the privileged guests admitted to the sovereign's intimacy were assembled.
We entered the first room of the dwelling. The Kisaki moved to a very low platform, covered with carpets and cushions, and half lay down on it. The women sat on the left, the men on the right, and immediately servants placed a small golden tray on the floor in front of each of them, covered with sweets and warm drinks.
Through all the open panels, the fragrant woodland air wafted into this fairly large room, which was filled with a green half-light, a reflection of the nearby trees.
green half-light, a reflection of the nearby trees. The walls were marvellously decorated: fabulous animals, the foo bird, the unicorn and the sacred tortoise stood out against azure, gold and purple backgrounds, and a screen in turquoise and dead leaf cloisonné zigzagged behind the dais. There was no furniture, nothing but thick carpets, cushions and satin drapes embroidered with birds in gold circles.
- First of all," said the Kisaki, "I'm not going to say a word. I am invincibly nonchalant and lazy. Besides, I want to hear stories, not tell them.
There was a lot of grumbling about this decision.
- It's irrevocable," said the queen, laughing; "you won't even get a few words of flattery once you've finished telling your story.
- Never mind!" exclaimed Simabara, "I'll tell the story of the wolf who changed into a young girl.
- That's it! that's it!" cried the women; the title has our approval.
- An old wolf.
- Ah, is that wolf old?" said a princess with a disdainful pout.
- You know very well that to give shelter to a human soul, an animal has to be old.
- It's true! it's true!" someone shouted, "start!
- An old wolf," continued Simabara, "lived in a cave near a busy road. This wolf had an insatiable appetite, so he often came out of his cave, walked along the side of the road and snatched up a passer-by. But the travellers didn't like this, so they stopped using the road and little by little it became completely deserted. The wolf meditated deeply and looked for a way to put an end to this state of affairs. Suddenly he disappeared and was thought to be dead. A few daring people ventured onto the path and saw a beautiful young girl smiling at them.
- Would you like to follow me and come and rest in a fresh and charming place?
They could not refuse, but as soon as she was far from the road, the young girl turned back into an old wolf and mauled the travellers; then he resumed his graceful form and returned to the side of the road.
Since then, not a single traveller has fallen into the wolf's mouth!
The princes applauded loudly at this story, but the women recoiled.
- This means that we are dangerous traps hidden by flowers," they said.
- The flowers are so beautiful that we'll never see the trap," said the Prince of Tsusima, laughing.
- Come on," said the queen, "Simabara will drink two cups of sake for hurting the women.
Simabara happily emptied the cups.
- In the old days," said Princess Iza-Farou, giving Simabara a mischievous look, "there were many heroes: people talked about Asahina, who grabbed a fully armoured warrior with both hands and threw him away, about Tametomo and his formidable bow, about Yatsitsoné, whose only shield was his open fan, and about how their great adventures were the talk of the town. It was said, among other things, that one day Sousigé, the unrivalled horseman, was returning from a trip when he spotted several of his friends crouching around a checkerboard; he threw his horse over their heads and the horse stood motionless on its hind legs in the centre of the board. The players were stunned and thought the horseman had fallen from the sky. I've never heard of anything like it in these days.
- Well, well!" exclaimed Simabara, "you're suggesting that none of us would be capable of accomplishing such a feat of horsemanship, and that the time for heroes has passed.
- Indeed, that's what I wanted you to understand," said Iza-Farou, bursting out laughing; "shouldn't I have retaliated against your insolent wolf?
- She had every right to avenge us," said the Kisaki, "and she won't be punished in any way.
- Rosebud knows a story, but she doesn't want to tell it," exclaimed a princess who had been whispering with her neighbour for a moment.
Fleur-de-Roseau hid her face behind the wide sleeve of her dress. She was a very young girl, still a little shy.
- Come on, speak up," said the Kisaki, "and don't be afraid, we have nothing in common with the Simabara wolf.
- Well," said Rosebud, suddenly reassured. On the island of Yéso there was a young man and a young girl who loved each other dearly. They had been betrothed to each other from the cradle and had never left each other's side. The girl was fifteen, the young man eighteen. They were thinking of setting a date for their wedding. Unfortunately, the son of a rich man fell in love with the girl and asked her father for her hand in marriage. However much the young couple begged him, his father remained inflexible.
So the bride went to her lover in despair.
- Listen," she told him, "since they want to separate us in this world, let death reunite us. Let us go to the tomb of your ancestors and kill each other.
They did as she said, they lay down on the tomb and stabbed each other, but the despised lover had followed them. He approached them when he no longer heard them speak. He then saw them lying side by side, motionless, hand in hand.
As he leaned towards them, two white butterflies rose from the grave and flew away, fluttering their wings.
- Ah," cried the jealous man angrily, "it's them, they're escaping me, they're fleeing into the light, they're happy, but I want to chase them across the sky.
Then he grabbed the abandoned dagger and struck himself.
A third butterfly flew up, but the others were already far away: this one never got to join them.
Even today, look above the flowers when spring returns and you'll see the two winged lovers flying past, very close to each other; look again and you'll soon see the jealous man who pursues them without ever reaching them.
- Indeed," says Iza-Farou, "butterflies are always grouped like this: two fluttering close together and a third following at a distance.
I had also noticed this peculiarity without being able to explain it to myself," said the Kisaki.
- The Prince of Satsouma must tell us something," said Rosebud.
- Me!" exclaimed the good old man, a little moved, "but I don't know any stories.
- Yes, yes, you do," cried the women, "you must tell us one.
- So I'm going to tell you about an adventure that happened a short while ago to the Prince of Figo's cook.
This statement provoked general hilarity.
- You'll see," said Satsouma, "you'll see that this cook has spirit. First of all, he is highly skilled in his art, which is nothing to sneeze at, and what's more, he takes great care over the smallest details of his service. A few days ago, however, at a feast I was attending, the servants brought a basin full of rice and uncovered it in front of the Lord of Figo.
What a surprise it was for him to see a black insect in the middle of the white rice, motionless because it had been cooked! The prince turned pale with anger. He sent for the cook and, using his ivory sticks, seized the vile insect and presented it to the valet with a terrible look on his face. There was nothing left for the unfortunate servant but to open his stomach as quickly as possible; but it seems that this operation was not to his liking, for, approaching his master with all the signs of the most lively joy, he took the insect and ate it, pretending to believe that the prince was doing him the honour of giving him a morsel of the meal. The guests laughed at this feat of wit; the Prince of Figo himself could not help smiling, and the cook was saved from death.
- Good! good!" shouted everyone in the audience, "now that's a story that hurts nobody.
- It's Nagato's turn," said Tsusima, "he must know some charming tales.
Nagato shivered as if he had been roused from a deep sleep. He had heard nothing, listened to nothing, absorbed in the delightful contemplation of the goddess he adored.
- Would you like a story?" he said, looking at the princes and princesses as if seeing them for the first time.
He thought for a few seconds.
- Well, here's one," he said: "There was a very small pond, born on a stormy day, it had formed on a bed of moss and violets, pretty bushes in flower surrounded it and leaned towards it the clouds, its parents, had not yet dissipated and already the birds were coming to brush its water with the tips of their wings and delight it with their songs; it was happy and enjoyed life, finding it good. But then the clouds parted, and something wonderful and dazzling appeared over the pond. It was transformed into a magnificent jewel box, but the clouds returned and the vision disappeared. What sadness and regret! The pond was no longer enchanted by the caresses of the birds; it despised the reflections of the flowers on its banks; everything seemed ugly and dark. At last, the sky became serene again, and this time for a long time. The luminous wonder reappeared; the pond was once again filled with warmth, splendour and joy, but it felt as if it were dying under the ever-burning golden arrows. And yet, if a light branch cast its shadow over him; if a fine mist rose and served as a shield! how he cursed them for delaying his delicious annihilation by one minute! On the third day, there was not a drop of water left - the pond had been drunk by the sun.
This tale plunged the princesses into a sweet reverie. The men declared that Nagato had created a new way of storytelling, and that this improvisation could have been put into verse.
The queen, who understood that the prince had spoken for her alone, glanced at him, almost in spite of herself, with a look of melancholy sweetness.
The day was drawing to a close. Two princesses came to kneel before the Kisaki, to take her orders for the next day's entertainment.
- Tomorrow," she said, after thinking for a moment, "we'll have a country lunch and a poetic battle in the Western Orchard.
They soon parted company and the ambassadors were led to the pavilions reserved for them, which were buried in greenery and flowers.
XII
THE WESTERN ORCHARD
When the Prince of Nagato awoke the next morning, he felt a sense of well-being and joy that he had not known for a long time. Enjoying that moment of nonchalant reverie that is like the dawn of awakening, he let his gaze wander over the leaping shadows of the leaves that the sun threw against the closed blinds from outside. Thousands of birds were chirping and twittering, and you would have thought it was the light itself that was singing in this sparkle of clear voices.
The prince thought about the happy day ahead.
It was an oasis in the arid, burning desert of his love; he pushed aside the thought of the next departure with its trail of sadness, and gave himself over entirely to the sweetness of the present; he was happy and at peace.
The night before, his mind full of memories and his heart full of emotion, he had realised that sleep would stubbornly elude him. So he had prepared a drink to combat insomnia.
He knew he was handsome, he had been told so a hundred times and women's eyes told him so every day. Hadn't this grace of body and face, this charm that emanated from his person, helped to attract the sovereign's benevolent attention? They therefore deserved to be spared the effects of fatigue and fever.
As soon as he had called the servants, the prince had a mirror brought to him and looked at himself in a hurry.
But the first glance reassured him.
His pallor had returned to the warm hues that the illness had taken from him, the blood had returned to his lips and yet his eyes still retained something of their feverish sparkle.
He paid childish attention to the details of his grooming, choosing the sweetest perfumes, the softest clothes, the light, vaguely bluish shades that were his favourites.
When he finally emerged from his pavilion, the guests had already gathered in front of the Kisaki's palace. His arrival caused a sensation; the men raved about his toilette, the women didn't dare speak, but their silence was most flattering, and could be translated as follows: this one is worthy of being loved, even by a queen, because this perfectly beautiful body is the temple of the most delicate mind, of the noblest heart in the whole empire.
Princess Iza-Farou-No-Kami approached Nagato:
- You haven't asked me about Fatkoura, Prince," she said.
The prince hadn't thought about Fatkoura at all, and hadn't even noticed her absence.
- She was ill yesterday," continued the princess, "but the news of your arrival has restored her health. She has been sad for some time, so perhaps your return will console her.
You'll see her in a little while, she's near the Kisaki, it's her week's duty. Well, aren't you going to say anything?
The prince did not know what to say; indeed, the name of Fatkoura aroused in him remorse and annoyance; he reproached himself for having inspired love in this woman, or rather for having seemed to respond to the love he sensed in her. He had used this false passion as a screen between the curious eyes and the sun of his true love. But he no longer felt strong enough to play the part of the infatuated lover, and instead of the compassion and friendship he tried to feel for his unfortunate victim, Fatkoura inspired only profound indifference.
The arrival of the Kisaki relieved him of the need to reply to Iza-Farou. The queen advanced under the verandah, greeting her guests with a gracious smile, and they all dropped to one knee.
As they had to climb a mountain and pass through narrow paths, the Kisaki had put on a dress that was not as loose as the one she usually wore. This glaucous dress was made of crepe, slightly wrinkled like the surface of a lake shivering in the wind; a wide belt of gold cloth tightened around the waist and formed a huge knot around the loins. A branch of blooming chrysanthemum was embroidered on one end of the sash. The queen wore large, finely worked blonde pins in her hair, and above her forehead a small round mirror surrounded by a string of pearls.
Soon, a magnificent chariot, drawn by two black buffaloes, pulled up in front of the palace. This chariot, topped with a roof and covered in gilding, resembled a pavilion. It was closed by blinds that the Kisaki had raised.
The princesses and lords took their places in norimonos carried by a large number of richly dressed men, and they set off joyfully.
It was a beautiful day, with a light breeze cooling the air, so the heat wouldn't bother us.
First we crossed the gardens of the residence. The carriage pushes aside the whimsical branches that flutter over the paths, making the butterflies fly and the flowers fall. Then you reach the wall surrounding the summer palace and pass through the high gate surmounted by the mikado bird, the Foo-Houan, the mythological animal that took part in the creation of the world. You then walk along the outside of the walls, taking a path lined with tall trees that leads to the mountains. It is here that the entire court descends to continue the journey on foot. Groups are formed, the servants open the parasols, and we cheerfully begin to climb the mountain. The Kisaki is the first to walk, as light and joyful as a young girl; she runs for a while, picking wild flowers from the bushes; then, when she has too much, she throws them on the path; conversations begin, laughter resounds, everyone walks as they please; Some of the lords take off their lacquered hats, which resemble round shields, and hang them from their belts, then fix their open fans under their hair, which has been twisted into a rope, so that it forms a canopy over their foreheads. 
From time to time, a gap in the bushes gives a glimpse of the city, which seems to expand as you climb higher; but you don't stop to contemplate it, as your first stop should be on the terrace of the temple of Kiomidz, i.e. the temple of Pure Water, from where the view is admirable.
On one side, this temple rests on prodigiously high wooden pillars that reach all the way down to the foot of the mountain; on the other, it backs onto a sheer rock face and houses a thousand-armed deity under its broad roof covered with blue porcelain panels.
On the pebble-covered terrace in front of the temple, folding chairs have been laid out for the noble strollers to rest and enjoy the beauty of the view.
They soon arrive and settle in.
Kioto stretches out before them, with its countless houses, low but elegant, surrounding the immense park of the Daïri
[1] , a lake of greenery from which rises here and there like an island, a broad and magnificent roof. You can follow with your eyes the clear line drawn by the walls around the park.
To the south of the town, a river, the Idogava, gleams in the sunlight.
The rich, well-cultivated plain stretches beyond. Another river, the Wild Goose, flows through the centre of the town, near the Nisio-Nosiro fortress, with its high ramparts and square tower topped by a roof raised at the edges.
Behind the town lies a semicircle of high hills covered with vegetation and temples of all kinds that climb the slopes and half disappear into the foliage and flowers. The lords show each other the temple of Iasacca or of the Eight Escarpments, the To-Tsé tower, with its five light roofs, the chapel of Guihon, which contains only a round metal mirror, and which is surrounded by a large number of pretty houses in which tea and sake are drunk; then down towards the plain, on the road leading to Fusimi, the colossal pagoda of the Daïbouds, very high, very magnificent, and which contains within its gardens the temple of the Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-Three Gods, a very long and narrow edifice. 
Strollers rave about the beauty of the site, delighted to lose themselves in the intricate network formed by the city streets, full of brilliant crowds, the enclosures and courtyards, which from above look like open boxes; With a single movement of their eyes, they cross Kioto; near the river, they see a large open space surrounded by a palisade, the manoeuvring ground of the horsemen of heaven, some of whom gallop within its confines, the embroidery on their clothes, their spears and helmets flashing with lightning. 
The deep green mountains bite into the vivid azure of the sky with their jagged edges, some of the more distant peaks have violet hues, and the atmosphere is so pure that you can clearly make out the little town of Yodo, linked to Kioto by the long ribbon of road that crosses the golden fields.
The Kisaki stands up.
- Let's not stop here for too long. Let's go higher up and drink the water from the Otooua waterfall, which, as the monks say, imparts prudence and wisdom.
- Isn't there a fountain whose water has the virtue of making you foolish and careless?" said Simabara; "that's the one I'd rather dip my lips in.
- I don't see what you'd gain from that," said a princess, laughing; "if the fountain you're talking about exists, you've certainly tasted its water.
If there were one that would make you forget your life and give you the illusion of a dream without waking up," said the Prince of Nagato, "I would get drunk from it.
- If I were you, I'd settle for the one that makes you cautious," said Fatkoura, who had not yet exchanged a word with Nagato.
This bitter, ironic voice made the prince flinch painfully. He said nothing in reply and hurried to join the queen, who was climbing a stone staircase carved into the mountain escarpment.
This staircase, lined with shrubs whose intertwined branches form a network of greenery above it, leads to the Otooua waterfall. You can already hear the sound of water rising from the rock through three cracks and falling from quite a height into a small pond.
The Kisaki is the first to arrive; she kneels on the grass and dips her hands in the pure water.
A young monk ran up holding a golden cup, but the sovereign waved him away and, putting her lips forward, sucked in the sip of water contained with great difficulty in the palm of her hand, then stood up and shook her fingers, a few drops falling onto her dress.
- Now," she laughs, "Buddha himself has no more wisdom than I do.
- You're laughing," said Simabara; "as for me, I believe in the virtue of this water, which is why I won't drink it.
We take a very rough path. The mere sight of it causes the women to cry out in alarm. Some of them declare that they will never venture down such a path, but the lords go first and hold out their closed fans to the most fearful, and we reach the top of the mountain. But then the cries of terror increase. There's a small torrent running ahead, skipping over the rocks, and you have to cross it by striding from rock to rock, at the risk of dipping your foot in the water if you're clumsy.
The Kisaki asked Nagato for the support of her shoulder and crossed. Some of the women followed, then turned round to laugh at those who didn't dare.
A young princess has stopped in the middle of the water, standing on a rock, clutching the voluminous folds of her dresses, laughing, though a little annoyed, she doesn't want to go forwards or backwards.
She only decided to take the wrong step when she was threatened with being left alone in the middle of the torrent.
It's only a few steps to the western orchard, surrounded by a hedge of tea bushes. The queen pushes open a louvered door and enters the enclosure.
It's the most enchanting place you'll ever see. Spring at this height is a little late, and while in the valley the fruit trees have already dropped all their flowers, here they are in full bloom. The plum trees covered in tiny white stars, the apricot trees, the apple trees, the peach trees with their pink blossoms and the cherry trees covered in crimson blossoms bend and twist over the undulating ground covered in thick turf, projecting their dark branches in all directions, their harshness contrasting with the fragility of their open petals.
In the centre of the orchard, a large carpet has been laid out on the grass, and a red satin drapery supported by golden poles flutters above. The food is laid out on this carpet in precious china.
The guests happily squat down in front of the trays laden with delicacies; the walk has given everyone an appetite. The women sit in two groups to the right and left of the Kisaki; the men sit opposite her at a respectful distance.
The most open merriment soon reigned among the noble gathering: laughter sprang from all lips; they chatted loudly and no one listened to the melodies played by an orchestra, hidden by a screen made of reed fibres.
Fatkoura alone keeps a sombre face and remains silent. Princess Iza-Farou looks at her stealthily with growing surprise, and from time to time at the Prince of Nagato, who seems absorbed in a gentle reverie, but never turns her eyes towards Fatkoura.
- What's going on?" murmured the princess, "He certainly doesn't love her any more, and I thought the wedding was so soon!
When the meal was over, the Kisaki got up: "Now," she said, "let's get to work, each of us inspired by nature to compose a quatrain in Chinese characters.
The group disperses under the orchard trees; each one isolates himself and reflects, some stopped in front of a branch in flower, others walking slowly, their gaze fixed on the ground or raising their head towards what we see of the sky through the constellations of white or pink flowers. A few indolent women stretch out on the lawn and close their eyes.
The fresh, cheerful colours of the costumes burst gaily against the greenery, adding yet another charm to the landscape.
Soon all the poets are recalled. The time allotted for devising the quatrain has passed. Everyone gathers and sits down on the lawn. Servants bring in a large bronze basin with sculpted dragons writhing on its sides, surrounded by fantastic branches. The basin is full of white fans, illustrated only with a faint sketch at one corner.
It's a clump of irises, a few slender reeds, a hut by a lake towards which a disbudded willow is leaning, a bird clutching a branch of an almond tree in blossom between its claws.
Each contestant takes one of these fans on which to write the verse piece. Brushes and diluted ink are also brought along. Soon the black characters line up in four vertical rows on the white of the fans; the poems are finished. Each poet reads his out loud.
Princess Iza-Farou begins: THE FIRST FLOWERS
"How fleeting is the moment in life,
"When we have only joys, hopes and no regrets!
"In spring, what is the most delicious moment?
"When not a single flower has yet wilted".
This poem was greeted with great approval.
When silence has been restored, Simabara speaks: THE LOVE OF NATURE
"I look up and see a flock of wild geese.
"One of them, who had been in the lead earlier, let herself be overtaken by her companions.
"There she is, flying behind the others. Why does she linger
Why does she linger like that?
"It's because from the heights of the sky she's contemplating the beauty of a viewpoint.
- Well done," cried the listeners.
Some of the princes repeated the last verse, shaking their heads with satisfaction.
Several more quatrains were read, and then the Kisaki recited her own: THE SNOW
"The sky is pure, the bees shiver above the flowerbeds.
"A warm breeze runs through the trees.
"It makes the plum blossoms fall abundantly.
"How pleasant it is to snow in spring!
- You are the master of us all," we exclaim enthusiastically.
What are our verses compared to yours!
- Our great poet Tsourai-Iouki never wrote a more perfect poem than this," says the Prince of Nagato.
- I was inspired by this poet," says the Kisaki, smiling with pleasure. But it's your turn to read, Ivakoura," she added, looking up at the Prince.
The Prince of Nagato unfolded his fan and read: THE WILLOW
"The thing you love most, that you love better than anyone could love it,
"It belongs to another.
"So the willow that takes root in your garden.
"It bends, pushed by the wind, and embellishes the neighbouring enclosure with its branches.
- The illustrious Tikangué could be your brother, says the Kisaki; there is no quatrain in his works superior to this one. I want to keep the fan that your hand illustrated, so please leave it to me.
Nagato approached the queen and, kneeling down, handed her the fan.
Fatkoura suddenly recited the quatrain she had been improvising:
"The pheasant runs through the fields, attracting attention with its golden plumage.
"It cries out as it searches for its food.
"Then he returns to his mate.
"And, out of love for her, he unwittingly reveals his place of retreat to men.
The queen frowned and paled slightly. A wave of anger swept through her heart, for she realised that Fatkoura, with this improvisation, was directing an outrageous slander against the Prince of Nagato and herself; she was insulting the sovereign with the fearlessness of a soul that has lost everything and is using despair as a shield against vengeance.
The Kisaki, feeling powerless to punish, was seized by a vague terror and tamed her anger. To understand the hurtful intent of Fatkoura's words, was it not to confess a guilty preoccupation, an interest unworthy of her majesty in the love that her beauty had aroused in the heart of one of her subjects?
She complimented Fatkoura in a very quiet voice on the elegance of her poem, and then had a page present her with the competition prize. It was a charming collection of poems, no bigger than your finger, as it was the fashion at the time for books to be as small as possible.
A few hours later, as the Prince of Nagato leaned on the edge of a terrace, gazing down from the mountain at the setting sun spreading crimson fragrances across the sky, the Kisaki woman approached him.
He looked up at her, thinking she wanted to speak to him, but she was silent; her gaze lost on the horizon and saddened, she maintained a solemn attitude.
The reflections of the West prevented her pallor from being seen. She was dominating a painful emotion and wanted to hold back a tear that shivered between her eyelashes and blurred her vision.
Nagato felt a sort of dread; he knew she was going to tell him something terrible, and he wanted to stop her from speaking.
- Queen," he said softly, as if to ward off danger, "the sky looks like a big rose leaf.
- It's the last petal of a day that's fading," said the Kisaki, "of a day that's fading into the past, but which our spirit will remember as a day of joy and peace, perhaps the last.
She turned away to hide the tears that were welling up in her eyes in spite of herself.
The prince's heart was clenched by inexpressible anguish; he was like the victim who sees the knife at his throat, and he dared not speak for fear of hastening the sacrifice.
Suddenly the Kisaki turned towards him
- Prince," she said, "I had this to say to you: you must marry Fatkoura.
Nagato looked at the queen with fear, he saw her eyes wet with tears, but full of a calm and irrevocable resolution.
Slowly he lowered his head.
- I will obey," he murmured.
And as she hurried away he hid his face in his hands and let out the sobs that were choking him.
XIII
THE THIRTY-THREE DINNERS OF THE MIKADO
The sublime Son of the Gods is bored. He is sitting cross-legged on a carpeted platform, between streams of gold brocade that descend from the ceiling and are gathered in large folds on either side.
A string of flats stretched out before the sovereign's eyes.
He thinks how majestic he looks, then yawns.
The hundred and ninth mikado, Go-Mitzou-No, although young, is excessively overweight, no doubt due to the almost constant immobility he maintains. His face is pallid, never touched by a ray of sunlight; several chins fold over his neck, the folds of his crimson robes crowd around him, the high golden blade rises from his forehead, and to his right are the insignia of omnipotence: the sword, the mirror, the iron tablet.
The Mikado finds life monotonous. All the actions of his life are regulated in advance and must be carried out according to meticulous laws. If he leaves the palace grounds, he is locked into a magnificent vehicle pulled by buffalo, but he suffocates in this tightly closed box and prefers to remain on his throne.
If he wanted to admire the flowers in the flowerbeds, he had to go to the gardens accompanied by a large retinue, and the annals of the kingdom record this event. Most of his time must be spent in meditation, but on the whole he meditates little, his mind is numb. When he does think, he is astonished by the strangeness of the ideas that buzz confusedly in his brain. Some of his thoughts are criminal, others buffoonish. These cheer him up, but he dares not laugh, knowing that he is being watched. He then tries to bring his mind back to heavenly things, but this tires him, and he returns to his fanciful dreams. Sometimes he is seized by an invincible desire to move about, to frolic, to jump; this is difficult to reconcile with the silent immobility that the descendant of the gods must maintain. One day, however, or rather one night, he mysteriously fulfilled his desire; he slipped out of his bed and, while all around him slept, he took a step of his own. No one has ever known this, or so he thinks. As he never sees anything but the bent backs of his subjects, he can truly believe that he is a superior species and that ordinary men walk on all fours. However, he finds that he is sometimes treated like a child. His bow and arrows have been taken away from him because one day, while several delegates from the Siogun were prostrating themselves at the foot of his throne, he shot an arrow at the noblest among them. Despite the irritation that sometimes boils within him, he does not dare to revolt; his inaction, the perpetual company of women who alone can serve him, have softened his courage, he feels at the mercy of his ministers, he fears being assassinated.
Sometimes, however, an immense pride invades him, he feels divine blood coursing through his veins, he understands that the earth is not worthy to be trodden by his feet, that men have no right to contemplate his face, he thinks of making the veils that separate him from the world even thicker. Then, the next moment, he imagines that perfect happiness would be to be able to run freely over the mountains, to work in the open air, to be the last of men; he is then seized by a vague despair, he moans, he complains. But we persuade him that his sadness is nothing more than nostalgia for heaven, his true homeland.
At this moment the mikado is ready to receive the envoys from Fide-Yori. They have come to express the latter's gratitude to the supreme sovereign who has conferred on him the title of siogun.
A blind is lowered in front of the throne, and then the princes are ushered in, rushing forward with their foreheads to the ground and their arms outstretched.
After a long wait, the blind was raised.
A profound silence reigns in the hall, and the princes remain face down on the floor, without moving.
The mikado looked down on them from his throne, musing to himself about the way the folds of their clothes had turned; about a sash that had been turned inside out and of which he could see the back; he thought that the insignia of Satsouma, a cross enclosed in a circle, looked like a skylight blocked by two bamboo slats.
Then he said to himself: What would they think if I suddenly started shouting in fury? I'd love to see them sit up straight with stunned faces.
After a few minutes, the blind was lowered again; the princes retreated backwards.
Not a word was spoken.
After the audience, the Mikado left the dais and was stripped of his cumbersome parade robes. Dressed in a simpler costume, he headed for the rooms where he ate his meals.
Go-Mitzou-No considers dinner time to be the most pleasant moment of the day; he prolongs this moment as much as he can. The mikado loves good food; he has a preference for certain dishes. When it came to his preferences, a terrible difficulty had arisen. The Son of the Gods could not reasonably focus his sublime mind on the details of cooking and indicate the dishes he wished to eat; nor could he submit to the whims of his cooks or ministers. After much thought, the Mikado found a way to reconcile everything; he ordered that thirty-three different dinners be prepared for him every day and that they be served in thirty-three different rooms. All he had to do was go through these rooms and choose the meal he liked.
Sometimes, after eating one dinner, he would go to another room and eat a second.
When he passed through the door of the first of the thirty-three rooms, twelve very noble and beautiful women greeted him. They alone had the right to care for him.
In the presence of the master, their hair must be untied and spread in the folds of their flowing dresses.
Soon the mikado sat down on a carpet in front of the dinner of his choice, and began to eat, but then the Kisaki entered unannounced. She too, in order to appear before the supreme lord, had to have freed her hair from all bonds; her beautiful black hair was therefore untied, waving all the way to the floor.
The mikado looked up at her in surprise; he hurried to swallow the morsel in his mouth.
- My beloved companion," he said, "I didn't expect to see you.
- My divine lord," she said, "I have come to tell you that I am shortly going to lose one of my wives; the beautiful Fatkoura is getting married.
- Very well, very well," said the Mikado, "and to whom?
- The Prince of Nagato.
- Ah! ah! I consent to the marriage.
- And which princess will you appoint to replace the one who is leaving me?
- I will appoint whomever you designate.
- Thank you, master," said the Kisaki, "I will leave your divine presence and ask you to forgive me for having dared to interrupt your meal.
- Oh, that's all right," said Go-Mitzou-No, who hastened to make up for lost time as soon as his wife had left.
XIV
THE FLIGHT HUNT
A few days after the reception of the ambassadors, at about the tenth hour of the morning, the hour of the snake, a young horseman was running at full speed on the road which leads from Osaka to Kioto.
At this time of day, the road is very crowded; beasts of burden, peddlers, men and women of the people pass each other all along the way. Farmers take the produce from their fields to the surrounding towns; they go to Fusini, Yodo, Firacca; goods of all kinds are transported from Osaka to Kioto: rice, salted fish, metals, precious wood, while Kioto sends the city siogun, tea, silk, bronze vases and lacquered objects.
The young rider took no notice of the congestion, handing the reins back to his horse and urging it on with his voice; besides, the road was always clear ahead of him, people hurriedly moved aside at the sound of his furious gallop and passers-by threw themselves to the sides of the road, which was lined here and there with houses built of beech wood.
The rider passed so quickly that, despite their efforts, the onlookers could not make out his face.
- It's a warrior," said someone, "I saw his weapons gleaming.
- It wasn't very hard to see," said another, "every movement he makes throws off flashes of light.
- He's a warrior of a high rank, I saw the golden straps of his command whip.
- Is he a general?
- Ask the passing swallow to go and see if the copper horns shine on his helmet. She's the only one who can catch up with this rider.
When he reached Kioto, the young warrior didn't slow down, he galloped through the town and entered the palace, asking for the envoys of the Siogun.
- They're at the summer residence," he was told, "or rather they're not. They are accompanying our divine Kisaki on the hunt; they left at sunrise.
- Which way is the hunt?
- On the shores of Lake Biva, at the foot of the mountains," replied the valet; "but my lord, would you like to join the illustrious hunters?
- Give me a horse," said the young man coldly, without answering the question.
He dismounted at the same time, and the servant led the exhausted horse away. Soon, two grooms brought in another horse, fully harnessed and full of enthusiasm.
The warrior got back in the saddle and set off again.
Lake Biva lies behind the chain of hills that envelops Kioto. To get there, you had to follow several valleys and take many detours. The young man could not always keep his horse at a gallop, because of the slopes to be climbed and descended. Sometimes, instead of following the winding path, he ran over the thick grass of the valleys to shorten the route. After an hour, he reached the shore of the lake, but then he didn't know which way to turn.
The lake, as blue as a sapphire, stretched as far as the eye could see; to right and left, small clumps of woodland, brown rocks, vast spaces covered in moss and heather, following one another indefinitely.
There was no trace of the hunt, no clue as to which direction to follow.
The young warrior did not seem to be moved by this circumstance; he made his horse climb an eminence and looked around. He then saw, in the middle of a bamboo grove, the roof of a small temple half-buried under the foliage.
He ran to the temple and, without dismounting, rudely struck the calling bell.
The noise woke up the temple guardian, an old monk with a bald head and a long, thin face.
He ran over and rubbed his eyes.
- Do you know which way the royal hunt is going?
- This morning I heard barking, neighing and laughter", said the monk, "but I didn't see anything. The hunters didn't come this way.
- That's because they've turned right", said the warrior, throwing a silver coin into the alms trunk covered with a bamboo trellis.
He galloped off again.
He ran for a long time, sometimes stopping to listen.
Finally, he heard some confused barking, even though the shore was deserted before his eyes. He stopped and looked around.
The barking was coming from the mountains; the galloping of horses could also be heard.
Suddenly, without transition, the noise was loud and violent. Black hounds emerged from a narrow gorge between the hills, soon followed by horsemen.
The whole hunt passed in front of the young man. He recognised the Kisaki by the veil of red gauze floating around her. Some of the princesses had a hooded falcon on their left fist; the lords, leaning forward, ready to throw arrows, held a large black lacquer bow.
As all the hunters had their heads raised and were looking high into the sky at a hawk chasing a buzzard, they passed by without spotting the young warrior. He galloped along beside them.
The dogs flushed out a pheasant, which came screaming out of a bush.
Another hawk was released.
As he ran, the warrior looked for the Prince of Nagato among the lords and approached him.
- Stop, Ivakoura," he shouted, "Fidé-Yori sent me to you.
The prince turned his head and shuddered. He stopped his horse. They stayed behind.
- Signénari! Nagato as he recognised the young chief.
What's happened?
- I bring grave and sad news," said Signénari. Civil war threatens us. Hiéyas has raised armies and is occupying half of Japan. With surprising speed, he has assembled considerable forces, far superior to ours.
The danger is imminent, which is why the master wants to gather all his servants around him.
- Alas! alas!" exclaimed Nagato, "the future frightens me, the country is going to be flooded with the blood of its own children. What does General Yoké-Moura say?
- Yoké-Moura is full of energy and confidence, and is calling a meeting of the war council. But another misfortune has struck us: the Prince of Mayada has ceased to live.
- He's dead, that dear old man," said Nagato, bowing his head, "the only one who never bowed to the invading power of Hiéyas! Had he been Fide-Yori's father, he wouldn't have loved him more than he did. It was he who, when Taïko died, brought him as a child to the Hall of the Thousand Nats and presented him to the princes, who swore loyalty to him. How many have betrayed him since that day! How many will betray him again! Poor Mayada, only you could command a little respect from Hieyas; now he fears nothing.
- He will fear us, I swear it," exclaimed Signénari with a heroic flash in his eyes.
- You are right, forgive me this moment of weakness," said the prince, raising his head. "I am so crushed by grief that this new sadness overwhelmed me for a minute.
The hunters had noticed the absence of the Prince of Nagato. Believing it to be an accident, the alarm was raised and the whole court fell back.
The prince was soon seen chatting with Signénari. They were joined, surrounded and questioned. The dogs barked, some horses reared; the falconers called back the birds that refused to obey and continued to pursue their prey.
- What's happened?
- It's a messenger.
- Is he bringing news from Osaka?
- Bad news!
Kagato led Signénari in front of the Kisaki.
The queen was riding a white horse covered in a network of pearls and adorned on the forehead with a silk tassel.
- This is the bravest of your soldiers," said Nagato, pointing to Signénari. He comes from Osaka.
Signenari bowed deeply, then resumed his grave and reserved attitude.
- Speak," said the Kisaki.
- Divine sovereign, it is with sorrow that I come to disturb your pleasures," said Signénari, "but I must inform you that the peace of your kingdom is threatened. He is preparing to attack Osaka in order to usurp the power entrusted to your servant Fide-Yori by the celestial Mikado.
- Is this possible?" exclaimed the Kisaki. Hiéyas would dare to commit such a crime! Is this man so soulless that, to satisfy his insatiable ambition, he would not hesitate to arm brother against brother and spill the blood of the sons of Japan on Japanese soil? Are you sure of what you are saying?
- The news reached Osaka last night by several messengers hastily sent by the princes, who are hastening to fortify their provinces. The daimio of Arima arrived at dawn this morning and confirmed the assertions of the messengers. Scouts were immediately sent to various points, and the siogun ordered me to call back his ambassadors as soon as possible to hold a council.
- Let's return to the palace," said the Kisaki.
The princesses whispered amongst themselves as they watched the young warrior.
- He's so charming!
- He looks like a woman!
- Yes, but what energy in his eyes!
- What coldness too! His quiet gravity is worrying and frightening.
- He must be terrible in battle.
- His heart must be as steely as his sword, so let's not look at him so much.
- Yes," said another, "a lot of women lose their minds over him; I've been told that he's so annoyed by the love letters and poems that are constantly being slipped into his sleeves, that he wears them slit open; that way the tender missives fall to the ground.
Nagato rode close to the queen.
- These events are going to delay your wedding, Ivakoura!
she said with a certain joyful emotion.
- Yes, Queen," said the prince, "and the hazards of war are so great that it may never happen. However, since Fatkoura is publicly my fiancée, I want her to go and live in my castle at Hagui, near my father, while we wait for the wedding; if I die, she will bear my name and be sovereign of the province of Nagato.
- You will be right to do so," said the Kisaki, "but death will spare you. I will make a wish that you remain safe and sound.
Nagato looked at her reproachfully. He didn't dare speak, but that look said everything he was thinking, it meant: "You know very well that death would be sweeter for me than the union you forced upon me.
The Kisaki, moved, turned her head away and put her horse down.
We returned to the Dairi.
When the mikado heard the news of the probable war, he seemed distressed, but he was also pleased: he did not like the regent, nor did he like the siogoun; although he was their sovereign lord, he had a vague feeling that they dominated him, he knew he was being watched by both of them, and he feared them. He was therefore happy to think that they were going to do each other the harm he wished them both.
The same day the envoys of Fide-Yori left Kioto and returned to Osaka.
XV
THE USURPER
In just two months, as Signénari had said, Hiéyas had become formidable; he had under his command an army that public rumour put at five hundred thousand men. The provinces of Sagami, Mikava and Sourouga, which belonged to him, had provided a considerable number of soldiers.
The lord of Ovari, the most devoted of Hiéyas' supporters, made all the able-bodied men in his principality take up arms, so that not a single labourer was left on his land. The prince of Toza had entrenched himself in a formidable manner on the large island of Sikof, situated to the south of the kingdom, opposite the bay of Osaka; from there he threatened the capital of Siogun.
Most of the sovereign lords of Japan, confident in the fortunes of Hiéyas, lent him their support and kept their armies at his disposal.
Hiéyas settled in Yédo, which was only a small town at the time, but whose strategic position had seduced him. Situated about halfway along the length of the large island of Nipon, at the end of a bay that cut deeply into the land, surrounded by high mountains, it was easy to fortify and, once fortified, impregnable. What's more, its position in the centre of Japan meant that, given the island's narrow width, it could cut off overland communications between the large island of Yéso, the northern part of Nipon and its southern part, in which Kioto, Osaka and the principalities of Fidé-Yori's supporters were located. In this way, half of Japan was isolated and forced to remain neutral or to take sides with Hiéyas.
The former regent had displayed unparalleled activity.
Despite his advanced age and failing health, he had travelled to all the places where he felt his influence was needed. Among the princes who were hostile to him, he pretended to still possess the power he no longer had and demanded the number of soldiers they were obliged to provide to the government in time of war. Then he would hasten to send these troops to distant points. If his enemies learned the truth, they would be unable to harm him.
But once he had carried out these bold plans and was in a position to begin the great struggle he wanted to undertake to usurp power, Hiéyas suddenly felt so weak, overwhelmed by fever and suffering, that he thought he was going to die. He hurriedly summoned his son, who was then staying at Mikava castle.
Fidé-Tadda, son of Hiéyas, was then forty-five years old.
He was a man of no great personal value, but patient and submissive to intelligences superior to his own. He professed boundless admiration for his father.
He rushed to his father's side, bringing with him his youngest daughter, a charming child of fifteen.
Hiéyas lived in a fortified castle that he had been building for many years in Yédo and which was not yet completely finished. From the room in which he was lying on thick cushions, he could see through the wide window opening the admirable Fouzi-Yama, whose snow-covered summit was billowing a light white smoke.
- Is that your daughter?" said Hiéyas, when Fidé-Tadda was beside him with the child.
- Yes, illustrious father, she's the younger sister of the siogoun's wife.
- Of the siogoun," repeated Hiéyas, shaking his head and sniggering.
She's very pretty, the little girl," he continued, after considering the young girl for a few moments, who was blushing and lowering her long black eyelashes to her cheeks.
Then he motioned for the child to be taken away.
- I may be dying, my son," he said when he was alone with Fide-Tadda, "that's why I sent for you; I want to give you my last instructions, to tell you what you should do when I'm gone.
Hearing her father speak like this, Fidé-Tadda could not hold back her tears.
- Wait! wait!" cried Hiéyas, smiling, "don't cry yet, I'm not dead and you'll see that my mind is not clouded as old Mayada would have you believe.
Listen to me and remember my words.
- Every word that comes from your mouth is to me as a fine pearl would be to a miser.
- I'll be brief," said Hiéyas, "I'm tired of talking. First of all, my son, you should know that the predecessor of Go-Mitzou-No, the present mikado, once honoured me with the title of siogoun. This was after the death of Taïko. I did not make a show of this title so as not to offend the friends of Fidé-Yori. I let the princes and the people get into the habit of calling me the regent. I didn't care what name was used to designate power, as long as the power was in my hands. But today, the title of siogun is of the utmost importance to me, because it is hereditary, and I can abdicate in your favour. You were talking earlier about siogoun. I am the siogun. It is true that Fidé-Yori has received the same title, and I did not remind his insolent advisors that this title belongs to me. I acted prudently. If I had been in their hands, they would have murdered me. But now I am waging this war, you should know, as the sole representative of regular power. I have embroidered on my banners the three chrysanthemum leaves that form the insignia given to me by the former Mikado; and it is in the name of his heir that I lead my armies. I act without his will, it's true; but as soon as I am victorious, he will approve of my actions.
Hiéyas was silent for a moment and took a sip of tea.
- But," he soon resumed, "death may surprise me, it threatens me, and my work must be finished after me.
That is why I abdicate today in your favour. You will remain at Mikava Castle, safe from the hazards of war, watching over your daughter, who may serve one of my projects, until the day when victory proclaims you the master of Japan; then you will establish your residence at Yedo, the best situated city in the kingdom.
Taïko-Sama, who was a man of genius, even though he was the son of a peasant, conceived the plan, as soon as he came to power, of making the sixty-one small kingdoms of which Japan is composed into a single kingdom with the Siogun as its head. One man's life was not long enough to see this project come to fruition. Nevertheless, Taïko undertook it with vigour, while carefully concealing his intentions. I alone was the confidant of his thoughts, and to this day I have not revealed them to anyone. When Taïko threw the princes into this war against China, which appeared to many to be an act of madness, it was to weaken the lords by an expensive war and to keep them away from their principalities for some time. While he led them into battle, I carried out his orders. I had the Tokaido built, the wide road that brazenly crosses the regions formerly under the sole control of the princes; I had the wives and children of the absent lords brought to Osaka, on the pretext of protecting them from all danger if, by misfortune, the Chinese army invaded the country. When the princes returned, the women were refused permission to leave. They were forced to take up permanent residence in Osaka, where they remain today, precious hostages who answer to the loyalty of the lords of the land. As Taïko was also a great man of war, victory crowned his risky venture and consolidated his power.
For a long time now, the Mikado had paid little attention to the affairs of the kingdom. Taïko thought it good that he should concern himself even less; he made his power illusory... Listen," continued Hiéyas, lowering his voice, "this power must be weakened still further; the mikado must have nothing more than the title of sovereign; heap honours on him, divide the kingdom and make him a king.
accuse him of honours, make him more and more divine, so that he raises his eyes to heaven and turns them away from earth for good.
Taiko has been interrupted by death in the accomplishment of his work, which has barely begun; the princes are still powerful and rich. Continue this work after me, divide up the kingdoms, sow discord between the lords; if two friends have principalities close to each other, forbid them to reside in their domains at the same time if they are enemies; instead, let them draw closer together. War will break out between them and one at least will be weakened. Always keep their wives in Yedo. Make ruinous luxury fashionable; the women will help you in this. Deplete the husbands' coffers, so that they are forced to sell their land. If, however, one of them is rich enough to be able to meet all these expenses, pay him a visit.
visit him, and may he be forced to spend his last scrap of gold in order to receive such an honour with dignity. Take care to keep Japan strictly closed to foreigners: the princes could form fearsome alliances with them. Therefore, do not let a ship from a distant land enter our ports. Seek out the Christians and slaughter them mercilessly: they are capable of fomenting insubordination and revolt. Do you understand me, my son? You must strive to make Japan a kingdom under a single master. But this goal will be difficult and long to achieve, and a man's life is short, which is why, when time has turned your hair white, you will call your son as I have called you today and pass on my words to him. I've finished.
- Father," said Fide-Tadda, kneeling before Hiéyas, "I swear to you that I will carry out your wishes to the letter.
- Good, my child, but send for the doctor," said Hiéyas, who was breathing heavily, suffocated by his long speech.
The doctor was ushered in.
- Illustrious scholar," said Hieyas, staring at him, "am I very ill?
- No, master," said the doctor with some hesitation.
- I order you to tell only the truth. Am I very ill?
- Yes," said the doctor.
- In danger of death?
- Not yet, but the life of fatigue that you lead may hasten your end.
- Will I be able to see the outcome of the war I am waging, supposing it lasts six moons?
- Oh yes!" said the doctor, "you could even prolong the war longer.
- Well, I'm rich," laughed Hieyas, "I don't need to hurry, I'm going to take a few days off.
XVI
THE FISHERMEN OF OSAKA BAY
An extraordinary commotion reigned in the castle of Fidé-
Yori castle. At any moment, military leaders covered in heavy armour pass through the gate of the first wall: the tread of their horses can be heard echoing under the deep vault.
They hastened to the third wall and entered the Siogun's palace.
Fidé-Yori, in a room next to the Hall of the Thousand Nats, was holding a council in the midst of the chiefs of his army and the princes most devoted to him.
The young Siogun's brow is worried; he does not hide his concern, which is shared by most of the warriors. However, some of them, full of ardour and faith, lifted the courage of their master.
- Our situation is not hopeless," says General Sanada-
Sayémon-Yoké-Moura, the most skilful warrior in the kingdom, but we must look at it coldly. Hiéyas has only one advantage over us: while we were not thinking of war, he has gathered armies; he is in a position to start the fight, we are not ready; but, in a few days, this inferiority will no longer exist; our troops will be on their feet and the game will become equal. For the time being, therefore, we must keep the enemy busy with insignificant skirmishes and keep them away from here, while we gather our forces around Osaka.
- For my part, I'm in favour of attacking Hiéyas immediately and not allowing him to take the offensive," said General Harounaga, a soldier of no great merit, but who had been quickly elevated by the active protection of Yodogimi, Siogoun's mother.
- Are you thinking about it?" exclaimed the young Signénari, "it would mean having our army massacred in a few hours by an army three times our size. We need to occupy the fortresses and protect ourselves from surprise until all our forces are united. If by then Hiéyas has not yet attacked us, it will be time to take the offensive.
- I stand by my proposal," said Harounaga. I have an idea that the army of Hiéyas is far from being as large as people imagine; how, in the space of one moon, could he have become so formidable?
- We can't act on suppositions," says Yoké-Moura, "and we're not in a position to attack; first and foremost, we need to build up our army.
- How many soldiers do we have at the moment? asked Fidé-Yori.
- Signénari, who has just been honoured with the rank of general despite his great youth, has twenty thousand men under his command; Harounaga has as many; Moto-Tsoumou and Massa-Nori each command ten thousand soldiers; Moritzka has fifteen thousand, and Yama-Kava five thousand. I am at the head of thirty thousand men. That makes a total of one hundred and ten thousand soldiers.
- How are we going to increase this army?" said the Siogun.
- You don't think, Master," said Yoké-Moura, "that the princes have not yet sent the troops that they are obliged to supply you with in time of war, and that these troops will at least triple the size of your army.
- You must not forget, however," exclaimed the Prince of Aki, "that certain provinces are directly threatened by Hiéyas or his allies and that these provinces will be forced to keep their soldiers or risk being immediately invaded.
- The provinces most at risk," said Signénari, glancing at a map, "are Satsouma, Nagato and Aki, because of their proximity to the principalities of Figo and Toza.
- What!" cried Fidé-Yori, "the Prince of Figo and the Prince of Toza have abandoned me?
- Alas, friend," said Nagato, "you didn't know; I had warned you of their treachery a long time ago, but your pure soul cannot believe in crimes.
- If this is so," said the Siogun, "the princes must guard their soldiers and go and lead them. You will have to leave me, Ivakoura.
- I'll send someone in my place," said the Prince of Nagato. I've decided to stay here. But let's not worry about that, let's hurry up and send our soldiers to their posts, let's not waste time with empty words.
- I agree with Yoké-Moura," said the Siogun, "that he should keep the enemy away from Osaka, while we finish gathering our forces.
- General Moritzka will leave immediately with his fifteen thousand men," said Yoké-Moura, "he will go to the province of Issé and inform the prince who governs this country of the defence plan. He should leave him five thousand men with orders to watch the movements of the lord of Ovari, his neighbour, and blockade his fortress, if possible. Then Moritzka will cross Japan in its width, and, leaving on the borders of the rebellious provinces the number of men he deems necessary, he will reach the principality of Vakasa and establish himself there. With the armies raised by the princes of this region, we will have around forty thousand men on the border.
Yama-Kava and his five thousand soldiers will camp on the shores of Lake Biva, behind Kioto, and the horsemen of the sky will join them and settle on the heights. Harounaga will lead his army to Yamasiro and cover Osaka from the north; Signénari will occupy the island of Avadsi, south of Osaka, and hold the treacherous lords of Toza and Figo at bay, whose attack would be most formidable at the moment. The rest of the army will remain in the vicinity of the city ready to be sent to the most threatened points.
- There is nothing to be taken back from the plan you have just outlined to us," said the Siogoun; "let it be done according to your orders and let us make haste.
The generals came one by one to kneel before the siogun, then left the room.
- Princes," said the Siogun to the lords who had remained near him, "return to your states. Those whose estates are threatened should keep their soldiers; the others should immediately send me all the men they can spare.
The princes came in turn to bow to the master: Satsouma, Ouésougui, Arima, Aki, Vakasa, then they left.
Fidé-Yori remained alone with Nagato.
- Ivakoura," he said, looking him in the eye. What do you think of this war?
- I think it will be murderous; but justice is on our side; even defeated we will be noble and glorious, and Hiéyas, even if victorious, will be covered in opprobrium. We have youth, ardour and strength. Hope is marching ahead of us.
- Thank you, friend, for encouraging me with your confidence, for my heart is full of worry.
- I'm leaving you, Master," said the Prince of Nagato. I'm going to organise my army.
- What do you mean by that?
- Do you think I'm going to sit here idle, useless? Do you think I'm going to watch the others kill each other and not get involved? I don't have soldiers but I will have them.
- Don't at least call up those from your province, don't let them invade your States.
- I'm not thinking about that," said the prince. I will not recall these soldiers, not because I want to keep my principality, but because my father lives in Hagui castle and my fiancée has just moved there to be with him: it is their precious lives that I want to keep safe behind the living rampart of my loyal army. Not one man will leave the province of Nagato.
- Well, where will you take this army you speak of? said the Siogun.
- That's a secret," said the prince; "when this army has performed some brilliant action, I will present it to you.
- I can't guess your plans," said Fidé-Yori, "but I'm sure that you will do nothing but noble and heroic deeds. Go, friend.
The Prince of Nagato returned to his palace, where he found a score of samurai, his vassals, gathered to do his bidding.
- Get your servants together and prepare your luggage; I'll let you know my wishes before sunset.
Nagato went back to his flats, but as he approached, a strange noise struck his ear.
- What's going on in my house?" he murmured.
He hurried into the room next to his bedroom.
He then realised that it was young Loo who was causing all the noise. He was armed with a chipped sabre and was circling a screen depicting life-size warriors. Loo was stamping his feet, uttering strange cries, insulting the motionless warriors and mercilessly thrusting his sword through them.
- What are you doing here?" cried the prince, half angry, half laughing.
Loo, at the sight of his master, threw down his weapon and rushed to his knees.
- What's the meaning of this?" continued Nagato.
Why are you tearing this piece of furniture to pieces?
- I was practising warfare," said Loo, in a voice he was trying hard to sound maudlin. This," he added, pointing to the screen, "is Ovari's castle with its soldiers; I was the army of the Siogun.
The prince bit his lips to keep from laughing.
- Are you brave, Loo?
- Ah, yes," said the child, "and if my sword cut, I wouldn't fear anyone.
- I think that if these warriors, instead of being made of silk and satin, were made of flesh and bone, you'd run like hell.
- Not at all!" exclaimed Loo, sitting back on his heels. I'm very mean and I've often got into fights; once I bit the ear off a warder because he wouldn't let me through, claiming it was too late; while he was calling for help, holding his ear, I jumped over the fence. Another day, I was chasing a stork that I had injured by throwing a stone at it. I grabbed its neck and bit it so hard that it ran away screaming. But I was angry with the dog because the stork had gone.
The prince reflected as he listened to Loo's stories; he remembered having heard about these adventures; they had been told to him and he had been advised not to keep this young servant at home.
- Would you like to go to war with me?" he said suddenly.
- Ah, my master," cried Loo, clasping his hands together, "I beg you, take me with you; I'm more flexible than a snake, more agile than a cat, I know how to slip in everywhere, you'll see that I won't be useless; besides, the first time I'm scared, you'll cut my head off.
- It's agreed," said the prince with a smile, "go and put on a very simple dark suit and be ready to accompany me. I shall need you this evening.
Nagato entered his room, while Loo, drunk with joy, frolicked away.
The prince was about to strike a bell to summon his servants, when he thought he heard a faint knocking under the floorboards.
Nagato went to close the open panels around the room, then returned to the spot on the floor where the noise was being heard; he lifted the mat and looked for a wooden knot on which he pressed his finger: part of the floor then parted, revealing a staircase leading down into the darkness. A man climbed the last few steps and entered the room.
At first glance, this man looked like Nagato; he was like a rough sketch of the perfect statue created by the prince.
- What have you been up to, my poor Sado? I'd forgotten all about you.
- I'm happily married," said Sado.
- Oh, I remember: the story of the princes disguised as blind men and the kidnapping of a whole family! You've got spirit.
This adventure kept the idle busy for a long time. But what do you
do you want from me? Are you short of money?
- Master, I've come to tell you that I'm ashamed of the life I lead.
- How can you have forgotten our agreements?
- No, my lord, I have forgotten nothing - I was a criminal, I was about to be beheaded when you pardoned me, because your illustrious father exclaimed when he saw me: This man looks like you, Ivakoura.
- I forgave you too," said the prince, "because, in my eyes, your crime was minor: you had avenged an insult by killing your enemy, that's all. But what were my conditions in pardoning you?
- To obey you blindly, to be devoted to you to the death.
That is what I have come to remind you of today.
- To what end?
- To the death..." repeated Sado, emphasising each syllable.
- Well, you're still alive, you're not released from your oath.
- Master," said Sado in a serious voice, "I am of noble origin, my ancestors were vassals of your ancestors, and until the day when anger made me commit a crime, not a stain had tarnished the lustre of our name. You saved me from death, and instead of making me expiate my fault by a hard life, which would have raised me in my eyes, you made my existence a continual feast. In your name I have performed a thousand follies, I have indulged in senseless luxury, I have enjoyed life, fortune and honours as if I were an almighty prince.
- Well, you were doing me a favour by doing my bidding, that's all. Your resemblance to me served to deceive my enemies and panic their spies.
- You have driven away your enemies today," continued Sado, "and my role as a young fool is over; but think, my lord, how useful I can be to you in the war that is beginning. Thanks to skilfully prepared make-up, I am able to make my face a fairly exact image of yours, I have become accustomed to imitating your voice and your walk, many of your friends know only me, and to them I am the true Prince of Nagato. What an advantage in battle to be two-faced! I'll draw the enemy in on one side, while you act on the other. They'll think you're here, but you'll be somewhere else. I accomplished my mission well when it involved being crazy and spilling gold, and I'll accomplish it even better when it involves being brave and spilling my blood for you.
- Your noble origin reveals itself to me in your words," said the prince, "and I esteem you enough to accept the offer you are making me; I know your skill in matters of war, it will be invaluable to us. But you should know that in this battle the dangers will be great.
- My life belongs to you, don't forget that, master, and if by chance I should one day die for you, the stain on my name will be removed.
- Well," said the prince quickly, "you are going to leave for my States, the neighbouring lords are seriously threatening them; you will lead my troops and defend the territory. But my supposed presence in my kingdom may attract many enemies. Hieyas hates me personally.
Whatever happens, you must uphold the honour of my name; remember that, to everyone, you are the Prince of Nagato.
- By imitating you, I have taken something of your soul," said Sado, "I swear to you that I will be worthy of you.
- I trust you," said the Prince, "I know how intelligently you have managed to fulfil the strange role I have entrusted to you, and all the adventures you have led in my name have ended in my honour. That is why I am giving you my full powers today. You will leave here, taking with you a large retinue, and it is I who will take the underground path; will you tell me what the exits are?
- There are two, master," said Sado: "one leads to an uninhabited fisherman's house on the banks of the Yodogava; the other to my wife's house. For, as I told you, I married a charming young girl whom I loved.
- What will become of her if you die?
- I place her under your protection, my lord.
- Make arrangements for her today," said the prince. I too can be killed and not return; my coffers are at your discretion.
- Thank you, magnanimous prince," said Sado, kneeling for a moment at Nagato's feet. Do you have anything else to recommend?
- Send the letter I'm about to write to the Siogun.
The prince took a sheet of bamboo fibril paper with a flowering vine on it and wrote quickly:
"Master, if anyone tells you that I have changed my mind and left for my States, beware of believing it, but let it be said.
"IVAKOURA".
He handed the note to Sado.
- Now," he said, "hide behind this screen for a moment, so that no one sees us together; when I am gone, you will do as I say.
- May happiness be your companion!" said Sado, hiding behind the screen.
- Thank you for your wish," said the prince, who sighed.
He went to pull out a sign and called Loo.
The young servant came running. He was dressed like a craftsman's child, but he had passed his sword to his belt.
He helped his master put on an unadorned suit, then the prince opened a chest and wrapped a considerable sum of money in his belt.
- Let's go, now," he said as he approached the underground passage.
Loo looked at the open trapdoor without showing the slightest sign of surprise. A lighted lantern was placed on the last step; he took the lantern and began to descend; the prince followed him and closed the trapdoor. They then descended fifty steps and found themselves in a small crossroads from which two narrow corridors led off.
The place smelt of damp earth and was bitterly cold.
- Which way are we going, Master?" asked Loo, looking at the two diverging roads.
The prince took his bearings for a moment.
- Let's turn right," he said.
They entered the narrow gallery, supported at intervals by wide black wooden beams, and walked for about half an hour until they reached the foot of a staircase which they climbed. This staircase led to the only room in a fisherman's house.
- We've arrived," said Nagato, glancing around.
The room was deserted and almost empty, a few blackened nets forming a kind of drapery on the walls; in one corner a small boat lay on its side.
- It's not nice here," said Loo disdainfully.
The door was closed on the inside by an iron bar, so Nagato lifted it and slid the panel into its groove.
The sun had gone down and night was rising fast, but the sky was still purple and bloody over the river. A few large boats could be seen moored near the banks, other boats were coming in from the sea, the sailors were lowering their woven reed sails, the sound of the ring sliding down the mast could be heard; a few fishermen climbed the steep staircases and dragged their wet nets back to their homes.
The large square-shaped lanterns on the fronts of the tea houses were already being lit; joyful clamour was beginning to escape from their gardens and open rooms.
The prince, followed by Loo, made his way towards the noisiest of these establishments, but to his great surprise, when he entered the gallery, which was already full of people, he was greeted by enthusiastic cheers.
- It's my brave Sado who's made me so popular," he thought.
he thought.
- The lord! The lord!
- Bring on the sake! Let's fan the barrels! The daimio wants us to get drunk!
- We will be! we will be! so drunk that we can't tell the moon from the sun!
- But we need lots and lots of sake! Then we can sing the ancient song of Daïnogon-Ootomo.
They all sang along to the song:
"Is there anything in the world more precious than sake?
"If I were not a man, I would like to be a barrel.
However, a sailor, naked to the waist and with a broad, unattractive face, approached the prince.
- We'll drink later," he said. The last time we saw each other, you split my cheek with a punch; I want to give you a rib or two and then we'll be friends.
- Do you know who you're talking to?" shouted Loo furiously, rushing towards the man of the people.
Loo pushed him away, but the child grabbed his arm and bit him until he bled.
The sailor cried out in pain.
- It's a wolf, that one! he shouted.
And he ran at Loo with his fists raised, but the prince grabbed him by the wrists.
- Leave this child alone," he said, "let's fight if you want. What's your name?
- Don't you know my name?
- I've forgotten it.
- It's all right for a prince to forget the name of an ordinary sailor," cried everyone, "his name is Raïden, like the god of storms.
- Well then! Raiden," said Nagato, "let's fight, since you hold a grudge against me.
- Let me go first," said Raiden, who was making a vain effort to free himself.
The prince let go. Then the sailor, clenching his fists, watched his adversary for a moment, then rushed at him; but Nagato, with one sudden and violent gesture, sent him rolling with his legs in the air amidst a great clatter of broken china, among the cups and flasks laid out on the floor.
All present burst into laughter.
If the prince doesn't pay, you'll have to sell a lot of fish to make up for it.
- I'll pay," said the prince, "but speak up, Raïden, do you want to continue the fight?
- No, thank you," said Raiden, "I've fallen into boiling tea, and it's cooking me; besides, you're even stronger this evening than usual, I'd be beaten.
- Sake! Sake! now that the quarrel is over, said those present. Tell me, Prince, how are we going to enjoy ourselves this evening?
- Let's drink first," said the prince, "today is hardly the time for merriment; sad news is circulating in the castle, anxiety is in everyone's heart, for civil war is about to break out; the follies we used to do are no longer in season, any more than flowers and foliage are when the first gust of winter blows.
Sake had been brought in. There was a great silence; all eyes were fixed on the prince.
- I've come to talk to you, who have sometimes been my companions in pleasure," he continued. You love to fight, you are brave, you are strong; would you like to be my companions again and fight under my orders, with the enemies of Fidé-Yori?
- We certainly would!" cried some of the sailors.
- But what would become of our wives and children?
- Who would feed them in our absence?
- You know very well that gold flows from my fingers like water from a fountain. I won't make you leave your job and risk your life without paying you handsomely. How much does a sinner earn in a day?
- That depends: on a bad day, when the sea is merciless, you don't earn even an itzibou; good catches sometimes earn up to half a kobang.
- Well, I'll pay you half a kobang a day for as long as the war lasts.
- Our blood isn't worth that!
- I won't back down," said the prince.
- But just think," cried Raïden, "there are so many of us, and if you hire us all at that price, the total will be considerable!
- I know how to count," said the prince, smiling, "I need two hundred men, that'll be a hundred kobangs a day, three thousand kobangs a month, thirty-six thousand kobangs a year.
Raiden's eyes widened.
- Where will you find so much money?
- You have no idea of the fortunes of princes," said Nagato, astonished by this strange debate; "I'll hardly notice this expense, so don't have any scruples.
- Fine! fine! if that's how it is, we accept," cried the sailors.
- For that price you can have us cut into fifty pieces," said Raïden, who had not yet recovered from his amazement.
- You will be running great risks," said the prince, "and you will have to be devoted and fearless.
- Those who fight with the sea no longer fear men," said a sailor; "we are used to danger.
- Listen," said Nagato, "you will choose fifty of the best and strongest of your boats; you will change nothing to their peaceful appearance; you will leave them equipped with their fishing gear and keep them ready to put to sea at the first signal.
- Agreed," said Raïden.
- I will provide you with weapons," continued the prince, "but you must hide them carefully; you must look like fishermen and not warriors.
- Very well! We understand," exclaimed Raïden, who was standing with his arms folded, listening attentively to the prince.
- I have nothing else to command you at the moment," said Nagato, "but keep our agreements secret.
- We won't even tell the seagulls that fly over the sea.
- The prince opened his belt and poured a heap of gold onto the floor.
- The pledge begins this very day for those present here," he said, "and I am going to give each of you a hundred kobangs. You will choose from among your companions the number of men necessary to complete my small troop; hire the bravest and the most discreet.
- Sailors don't talk much," says Raïden.
- Fishermen especially, noise frightens the fish.
- Come on, Loo," he said, "the prince has come to count the money.
Loo approached and began to arrange the small gold blades in piles.
Each man came forward in turn and said his name, which Nagato was writing on a long sheet of paper.
The prince gazed with pleasure at the naïve and fearless faces of these men who had just sold their lives to him; he told himself that rarely at court had he met the loyal gaze that he saw shining there in all the eyes.
Most of these men were bare-chested, showing off their strong muscles and laughing with pleasure as they took the money.
Soon the prince left the teahouse and made his way up the banks of the River Neuve. For a long time afterwards, he heard the laughter and voices of the sailors drinking sake and singing at the top of their voices the song of Daïnogon-Ootomo Loo, who had heard it for the first time, tried to remember it, and hummed it as he walked behind the prince:
"If I were not a man, I should like to be a keg!"
XVII
THE ISLAND OF THE DRAGONFLY
The beautiful Yodogimi is shedding tears. She is standing, leaning against a black lacquer panel, one arm raised in pain, her fingers lightly clasped on the smooth, shiny wall, her head tilted back, slightly tilted towards her shoulder: she is crying without forgetting that she is beautiful.
Yodogimi is nearly forty: who would believe it to see her looking so charming? Her very large eyes are still full of sparkle, her lips are fresh, her complexion is pure and the single twist of her hair rolls down to the ground like a black snake.
The princess, as is her custom, is magnificently adorned; a prize belt clasps her slender waist and the embroidery on her dress is of marvellous workmanship.
A few steps away from her, General Harounaga, her lover, is standing in full war costume, whip with golden straps in hand; he is looking intently at the floor and would like to bring a tear to the edge of his eye, but he cannot.
From time to time, he lets out a deep sigh.
- Alas! alas!" cries Yodogimi, "you are going to leave, forget me, perhaps die!
- I can die," said the general, "but I cannot forget you.
- To die! Have you no heart, then, that you dare speak to me of your death? Men are cruel; they swear to be devoted to you, and then for nothing they abandon you.
- It's not my fault there's a war on, I have to leave for Yamasiro with my soldiers.
- What if I ordered you to stay?
- I would disobey you, Princess.
- You shamelessly admit it. So I forbid you to leave!
- So be it," said the general, "I don't know how to resist your wishes; but this very evening I'm going to slit my stomach.
- Because you're bored of staying with me?
- No, because I will be dishonoured, and one should not survive dishonour.
- Ah, I'm mad," said the widow of Taïko-Sama, wiping her eyes; "I'm talking like a child, I advise you to be a coward.
Go on, spare no blood; if you die, I shall die too.
How handsome you look in battle dress! she added, looking at him with complacency. So you dress up like that for the enemy?
- It's customary," said Harounaga, "besides, arrows bounce off these horn scales and sabre blows can't damage them.
- Don't talk like that, I feel like I'm in the middle of battle," cried Yodogimi. I can see the arrows flying and hear the clash of iron. What will become of me during these long days of worry?
- Yamasiro is not far from Osaka," said the general, "I will send you news from the camp often.
- Yes, won't you? Send a messenger every day.
- Let him bring me a word from you every day. Farewell, most beautiful princess.
- Farewell, intrepid warrior. May heaven grant that we may meet again soon!
Harounaga rode away, and as he crossed the palace courtyard, Yodogimi leaned out of the window to see him again.
The page holding the warrior's horse told the general, as he helped him into the saddle, that the most worrying news was circulating in the castle. The vanguard of the enemy army had been seen at Soumiossi, that is to say a few leagues from Osaka; the troops of the siogun had therefore not succeeded in blocking the whole width of the island of Nippon, as had been planned.
Harounaga hurried to join his army corps, which was waiting for him outside the castle walls, ready to leave.
Several horsemen galloped out to meet him. The siogun had just arrived at the camp and was asking for Harounaga.
- Don't go to Yamasiro," he told him as soon as he saw him, "go to Soumiossi and try to crush the rebels, if it's true that they are already established there.
- I'm on my way, master," said Harounaga, "and I swear to be victorious.
A few moments later, he left Osaka with his army.
At the same time, several fishing boats, taking advantage of the tide, left the port and, pushed by a strong breeze, made their way out to sea.
It was Nagato's flotilla.
The prince was one of the first to learn of the appearance of Hiéyas' soldiers at Soumiossi. He immediately decided to set sail and sail to the threatened area.
Each boat was manned by four men; the one Nagato was in had an extra man: Loo. Loo had caught a few fish and was watching them writhing and dying with naive cruelty. Raïden was at the helm.
The prince, lying at the bottom of the boat, gazed vaguely above him at the big brown sail, creaking as it swelled, and the tangle of ropes; he was dreaming. The same dream, always, filled his soul; it was like the sea that eternally reflects the sky. Every event, every action painfully worried the prince, saddened him; they were clouds veiling his love, preventing him from absorbing himself entirely in it. However, his noble character urged him to devote himself to his lord, to shed his blood for him, to save him, if possible; but, in spite of himself, he often forgot the war, Hiéyas, the intrigues, the crimes, just as silence, when it returns, forgets the clamour that had disturbed it for a moment. He would then think of a look falling on him, an inflection of his voice, a fold of veil lifted by the wind and brushing against his lips; he would rediscover the shiver that this light contact had sent through his blood. He thought for a moment that perhaps
Perhaps she too was thinking of him, and he pursued this wandering thought through space.
The waves gently rocked him and encouraged him in these wild reveries; the wind blew, the swollen sail resembled an enormous crescent; the water, quickly pushed back, lapped at the bow.
- It's not to distance myself from her," he murmured, "that I've embarked on this singular adventure. I am counting on chance to provide me with opportunities to serve my prince, because if I were asked to explain my plan of campaign I would be very embarrassed. I have no other aim than to move to the most perilous points, fight furiously and then move away without making myself known. According to General Yoké-Moura, however, a small independent cohort, appearing in the middle of a battle, can sometimes tip the scales of victory and render great services... I remember this at the right moment to justify my conduct," added the prince, smiling.
The fifty boats making up the flotilla were scattered across the sea; Loo said they looked like a swarm of butterflies about to drown.
Towards the middle of the day, we approached the coast. Soumiossi was only a short distance away and Nagato wanted to go ashore to try and gather more information about the enemy army.
A small cove sheltered the boats that landed, most of which stayed out to sea, but only twenty men went ashore with the prince. They reached a road that ran a hundred paces from the sea and set off in search of a village. They walked for some time, but suddenly those who had been ahead and had already turned a bend in the road hurried back.
- A daimio! A daimio! they shouted.
- Well, what does it matter," said the Prince of Nagato.
- If we block the road, they'll either walk over us or cut off our heads," said Raïden.
- Go and see, Loo," said the prince, "what name is written on the post by the side of the road; if the lord whose passage it announces is less noble than I, we will throw the post to the ground, and, although I have no retinue, the prince will make way for me.
Loo, after looking around for a moment, ran towards one of the posts that the lords have planted on the roads they have to travel, to indicate the day of their passage.
The child soon returned with a stunned look on his face.
- It's you, master, who'll be passing this way," he said.
- How?" said the prince.
- It's written on the board," said Loo, "The almighty Ivakura-Teroumoto-Mori, Prince of Nagato, will pass through this region on the tenth day of the fifth moon.
- Silence, Loo," said the prince, "don't be surprised by anything and be discreet... it's Sado who's going to my States," he added to himself.
- Already, in a light cloud of dust, the forerunners of the procession turned the corner of the road.
They were valets, scribes and cooks carrying all sorts of utensils.
The sailors knelt at the side of the road; the prince hid behind a hedge of rosehips.
The first group passed, followed first by a score of horses laden with boxes and packages wrapped in red leather, then by a large number of men carrying pikes, banners, swords, bows, quivers and parasols.
A crowd of servants then came forward; each man carried on his shoulder a varnished chest containing clothes or some object for the prince's use.
Then appeared, in succession, officers holding luxury weapons and the princely lances adorned with cock feathers or leather straps; grooms driving richly harnessed horses; a samurai, followed by two valets, holding on his arms the hat under which the prince shelters himself from the sun when he sets foot on the ground; another lord carrying a parasol in a black velvet sheath; behind them, the servants and luggage of these lords paraded silently.
Then appeared twenty-eight pages in round hats, preceding the prince's litter. These pages moved in a peculiar way; at each step they threw one of their feet backwards, raising it as high as possible, and at the same time threw one hand forward, as if they wanted to swim.
At last, the lord's norimono approached, carried by eight men who took small steps forward, supporting in the palm of their hand the single stretcher passing like a bow over the palanquin, and whose other outstretched hand seemed to want to impose silence and express respectful fear.
The walls of the norimono were covered in black lacquer spiked with gold nails, bearing the insignia of the sovereign of Nagato: three balls surmounted by a bar. The interior of this large chest was lined with brilliant silk fabrics, and on a mattress covered with a velvet carpet, the prince was lying down, leafing through a book.
The norimono passed and the procession ended with a crowd of squires, pages and banner-bearers marching in perfect order and in the deepest silence.
- The truth is," said Raïden, who stood up and rubbed his dust-stained knees, "this is all very nice, but I'd rather be just a sailor and walk as I please without all this cumbersome paraphernalia.
- Be quiet," said another, "you'll upset the lord.
- He undoubtedly shares my opinion," said Raïden, "since, as a prince, he became a sailor.
They headed for the next village, and before they had questioned anyone, they had more than enough information about what they wanted to know. Several neighbouring villages had immigrated to this one. The streets were packed with people, carts and cattle. A tremendous hubbub arose from this crowd of men and animals. The frightened buffaloes bellowed and crushed each other; the pigs, which were tripped over, uttered high-pitched howls; the women moaned, the children cried; and the story of events, repeated over and over, ran from group to group.
- They've taken Dragonfly Island!
- Opposite Soumiossi, you can see them from the coast. The islanders were unable to flee.
- They came on three war junks, three beautiful junks, gilded in places, with very high masts and banners floating on all sides.
- Is it the Mongols?" asked a few old men, who had vague memories of ancient wars and foreign invasions.
- No, it's the regent who wants the Siogun to die.
- How many soldiers have landed on the island?
asked Kaïden, who had slipped through the crowd.
- We don't know; but there were a lot of them; the junks were all full of them.
- About fifteen hundred men," said Raïden.
- It's the vanguard of the Hiéyas army," said Prince de Nagato in a low voice; "if Fidé-Yori's troops don't arrive soon, Osaka will be in the greatest danger. Let's take to the sea again," he added, "I have a plan which, although madly audacious, may succeed.
Before leaving the village, Nagato ordered Raïden to buy a large number of carpenter's tools. They then made their way to the beach and reembarked.
Towards evening, the small fleet arrived in sight of Soumiossi and took shelter behind a promontory that completely masked them.
The place was admirable. Enormous trees, their uncovered roots clinging to the earth and rocks like the talons of birds of prey, leaned out to sea; bushes and shrubs crumbled towards them with clumps of their superb flowers; the waves were all strewn with flying petals, which sailed away, gathering in islets or long garlands. On some of the sharp rocks the waves leapt, throwing up a white foam; seagulls flew in, looking like foam made into birds. The water was a uniform shade of blue satin, glazed with silver, of incomparable softness and brilliance; and the sky retained from the vanished sun an expansion of fluid gold that still dazzled. In the distance, the island of Dragonfly, green and fresh, cut its insect-like contours. The coast of Soumiossi, all ruddy, stretched out with its jagged cliffs, and at the top of the promontory a small pagoda raised its pointed roof, paved with porcelain, and whose angles seemed to be raised by the four chains attached to a golden spire.
The prince thought of another sunset, the one he had seen from the top of the mountain, near Kioto, with the queen at his side; he closed his eyes and saw her again, so beautiful, so noble in her silent admission of her grief, her eyelashes shining with tears, turning her pure gaze towards him and ordering him to marry his rival. The smallest details of her words and gestures, the little mirror above her forehead casting rays like a star, were engraved in his mind with astonishing clarity.
- It was a painful moment, he said to himself, and yet it seems to me, from the memory, that it was full of charm. She was there at least, I could see her, I could hear her, the sound of her voice was a balm to the cruelty of her words, but now what a pain to live, time is like a boundless sea, where no rock, no ship's mast allows the exhausted wing to rest for a moment!
Three very light canoes were put out to sea, barely protruding above the water. As soon as night had fallen, Nagato chose eight of the most intrepid men, keeping Raïden and another sailor called Nata with him. They climbed into the canoes, three men in each boat.
- If you hear gunfire, come and join us," said the Prince of Nagato to those who remained.
And the three canoes sailed away without a sound.
Those on board were armed with swords and daggers, and they were carrying tools bought in the village, as well as several rifles. These weapons, of foreign invention, were often damaged or imperfect, and most of the time either failed to fire or exploded in the hands of the soldier, so they were usually equally feared by those who used them and those they threatened. The prince had succeeded in obtaining fifty new, well-made rifles, which was a great strength for his small army; however, the sailors looked at these foreign devices out of the corner of their eye with a certain contempt.
The boats glided through the shadows, steering straight for Dragonfly Island. The sound of the oars, handled with care, mingled with the thousand muffled clamourings of the sea. A light breeze picked up and whistled in our ears.
The closer we got to the island, the quieter we tried to move forward.
Fires could already be seen between the trees; we weren't far off, because the ear could clearly hear the regular steps of a round passing close to the shore.
The prince ordered them to sail around the island and look for the war junks.
They were at anchor a short distance from the shore, with the island of Dragonfly between them and the coast of Soumiossi.
Soon they appeared to those in the canoes, their large hulls and tall masts outlined in black against the less intense darkness of the sky; placed almost flush with the water as they were, these junks seemed gigantic to them. On each of them a lantern shone at the foot of the mast, masked from moment to moment by a sentry who came and went on deck.
- Those sentries will see us," said Raïden in a low voice.
- No," replied the prince, "the lantern lights up the place where they are and prevents them from making out anything in the darkness where we are. Let us approach now, and may our mad venture end in glory!
The three boats moved away from each other, and each of them, without making more noise than a gull gliding on the water, went alongside one of the ships.
The canoe carrying the prince had approached the largest of the junks, which was positioned between the other two.
The shadows were gathering even thicker under the bulging sides of the ship, the black water lapping, causing the light boat to bang against the giant hull; but the noise mingled with the incessant shock of the water and the continual fall of wave after wave onto the shores of the island.
- Let's stay here," said the prince in a voice that was barely audible, "no matter how much we lean over the top of the ship, no one will be able to see us.
- That's true," said Raïden, "but we won't be able to do anything here, the boat isn't stable enough; if we could reach the bow of the ship, we'd be more at ease.
- Come on," said the prince.
The three of them knelt in the boat, pressed their hands against the junk and moved forward rapidly; sometimes an involuntary bump, which seemed to make a terrible noise, made them stop, then they set off again. They reached the bow of the ship.
At that moment the sentry shouted:
- Oho!
He was answered from the other junks:
- Oho!
- Oho!
Then all fell silent.
- Let's get to work," said Nagato.
It was simply a question of sinking these large vessels by making a wound below the waterline wide enough to allow the water to flood them.
- What the reef accomplishes with the greatest ease, we might be able to do with a little effort, the prince thought.
The tools that had been used to build the ship's hull could usefully be employed to demolish a fragment of it. All we had to do was make an opening wide enough to stick our fist through, or lift a plank, and the water, which is only too happy to enter and slip through, would be happy to do so.
Raïden, leaning out of the dinghy, felt the slimy, water-covered walls of the ship and looked under the sticky foam, tar and paint for the heads of the nails fixed into the wood.
The prince and the sailor Nata were trying to keep the canoe more or less still.
Raïdcn took a tool from his belt and, with great effort, popped a few nails.
- This ship is solidly built," he said, "the nails are as long as sabres, and what's more, they're rusty and stick in the wood like big teeth in a young jaw.
- Do you think you'll be able to get the job done?
- I hope so," says Raïden. It's impossible for a lord like you to have gone to all this trouble for nothing. It's just that I'm not comfortable in this position, with my head down, and forced to pull the nails at an angle: I have to get into the water.
- Have you thought about that?" says Nata, "the sea is very deep here.
- There's a rope in the dinghy, isn't there?
- Yes," says Nata.
- Well, tie both ends to the seat.
Nata hurried to obey, and Raïden passed the rope under his arms.
- This way I'll be suspended in the water," he said.
And he let himself slip silently out of the boat.
For more than an hour, he worked in the dark, without saying a word, and as his hands worked below the water, he made no noise. We could hear the monotonous footsteps of the sentry and the crash of the waves against the ship.
- Pass me the sake," said Raïden at last, "I'm cold.
- It's my turn to work," said Nata. Get back in the boat.
It's finished," said Raïden, "the nails have been taken out all around a plank as long as our boat and as wide as Nata is from shoulder to shoulder.
- So you've succeeded completely? says the prince.
- Not yet, the hardest part is still to come: the plank is interlocked with its two neighbours and there's nothing I can do to pull it out.
- Try to slide your tool into the crack.
- I've been trying for a while, but to no avail," says Raiden; "the board would have to be pushed from the inside.
- That's impractical," said Nagato.
Raiden raised his head; he was looking at the hull of the ship.
- Isn't there a porthole above us?
- I can't see anything," said the prince.
- You're not used to seeing in the dark on stormy nights like we are," said Nata, "but I can see the porthole perfectly well.
- You'd have to go in there and push the plank out," said Raïden.
- You're crazy, none of us can fit through that narrow opening.
- If little Loo were here," murmured Raïden, "he'd get in!
At that moment, the prince felt something stirring in his legs, and a small shape rose from the bottom of the boat.
- Loo knew he would be needed," she said.
- Are you there?" said the prince.
- We're saved, then," said Raïden.
- Quick," said Loo, "hoist me up to the skylight.
- Listen," said Raïden in a low voice, "once you're in, you'll feel the wall and count five planks as you go down, right below the opening, the sixth plank being the one you'll find.
If you pushed it all the way in, the water would swallow you up.
- Good!" said the child.
Nata leaned against the junk.
- You're not afraid, Loo," said the prince.
Loo, without speaking, nodded. He was already on Nata's shoulders and clinging with both hands to the edge of the opening. Soon he pushed his torso in, then his legs, and disappeared.
- It must be even darker in there than it is here," said Nata, who was pressing her ear against the junk.
They waited. Time seemed long. The same anxiety kept them immobile.
Finally, a creak was heard. Raïden felt the plank oscillate. A second jolt made it protrude from its grooves.
- Enough! enough! or you're lost!" said Raïden, without daring to raise his voice.
But the child heard nothing; he continued to strike with his closed fists with all his strength. Soon the plank came loose and floated above the waves.
At the same time, with the sound of a torrent, the water rushed into the ship.
- And the child! the child!" cried the prince in anguish.
Raïden plunged his arms desperately into the gaping, black, tumultuous opening.
- Nothing!" he said through gritted teeth. He's been swept away by the force of the water.
At that moment, cries were heard from one of the neighbouring junks; lights were running across the deck; in the darkness, they seemed to move in the air.
- Our friends may need us," said Nata.
- We can't abandon this poor child," said the prince, "as long as there is hope of saving him; we won't move from here.
Suddenly, Raïden let out a cry of joy: he had just felt a small hand clinging to the edge of the hole in the ship.
He soon pulled the child to him and threw him into the boat.
Loo did not move; he had fainted. Raïden, dripping with water, climbed back into the boat.
- Here's one who won't be long," said Nata, rowing the junk away from the light boat.
- Let's go and see the others," said Nagato, "it may not be over yet.
The cries redoubled and the alarm was raised on all sides. On the shores of the island there were also lights and the sound of hastily gathered weapons.
- We're sinking! We're sinking! shouted the crew of the junks.
Several men threw themselves into the sea. They breathed heavily as they swam hastily towards the shores of the island.
The junks were sinking steeply; you could hear the bubbling of the water invading them; the enemy was there and you couldn't see them. The more the lights were multiplied, the darker the sea seemed.
The Prince of Nagato leaned out of the boat and tried to peer into the darkness. Suddenly, a violent shock made the boat jump, and for a few moments it shook in a disordered manner.
- We can't see anything either," said a voice. "Forgive us, Prince, for hitting you like this.
- Ah, it's you," said Nagato, "have you succeeded?
- We'd still be at work if our mission wasn't finished. Like an army of rats we gnawed away at the wood and made a big hole in the junk.
- Good! good," said the prince, "you really are invaluable helpers.
- Let's take to the open sea," said Raïden, "they still have boats, they might come after us.
- And our companions?
- They'll be all right, you can be sure of that. Perhaps they are already far away.
The soldiers were throwing arrows at random, and some of them could be heard falling into the water like rain around the canoes.
- They're so clumsy they could hit us without meaning to," said Nata, laughing.
- Out to sea!" cried Raïden, rowing vigorously.
The darkness had lessened for a moment, and a pale whiteness spread across the sky like a drop of milk in a cup of water. From the edge of the horizon, the glow emanated more brightly, though dimly, barely illuminating. It was the dawn of the full moon. Soon, like the tip of a sword reaching beyond the horizon, the star cast a steely glint. Immediately a trail of alternating light and dark ran across the sea to the shore, blue sparks sparkled on the crests of the waves; then the moon appeared like the arch of a bridge, and finally it rose up in its entirety, like a mirror of metal.
We were beyond the reach of the soldiers, Nata had taken the oars; Raiden was rubbing sake into Loo's head, which was resting on the prince's lap.
- At least the poor child isn't dead!" said Nagato, placing his hand on Loo's heart.
- No, see: his little chest is rising painfully, he's breathing, only he's cold; we've got to get him out of his wet clothes.
Nata took off her tunic and wrapped the child in it.
- You remember, Prince, how he bit me when I wanted to fight you? All I want is for him to bite me again.
The sailor tried to loosen Loo's clenched teeth and poured a stream of sake into his mouth.
The child swallowed hard, sneezed, coughed and then opened his eyes.
- So I'm not dead?" he said, looking round.
- But it seems not," cried a joyful Raïden. Would you like a drink?
- Oh no!" cried Loo, "I've had enough. Sea water is very bad, I've never tasted it before, I'll have to eat a lot of banana jam to forget what it tastes like.
I'll have to eat a lot of banana jam to forget that taste.
- You're not suffering? said the prince.
- No," said Loo; "has the junk sunk at least?
- By now, all you can see is the tip of the mast," said Nata. You had a lot to do with the success of the venture.
- You can see, Master, that I can be of some use," says Loo proudly.
- Certainly, and you are as brave as the bravest man," said the prince; "but how did you get here?
- That's it! I saw that they didn't want to take me away, so I hid under the bench.
- Will you tell me," cried Raïden, "why you pushed the plank so hard, despite my recommendations?
- It was to be sure that the junk wouldn't escape; and then I heard noises in the ship: we had to hurry.
Besides, I might not have been able to get back up. There were all sorts of beams, ropes and chains banging against me, because I couldn't see any more than if my head had been in a black velvet sack.
- And when this column of water fell on you, what did you think?
- I thought I was dead, but that the junk would sink of course; I heard what sounded like thunder, and I drank! I drank! through my nose, through my mouth, through my ears, and then I didn't feel a thing, I don't remember.
- You were very close to death, my poor Loo," said the prince; "but for your good behaviour, I'll give you a fine, sharp sword, and you can wear it at your belt, like a lord.
Loo looked at his companions, illuminated by the moon, with a look of pride, accompanied by a smile that puffed out his cheeks and made two dimples.
A misty blue glow spread over the sea, and you could see for quite a distance.
- Two junks have disappeared," said Nagato, looking towards the island, "the third is still standing.
- I seem to see boats circling around it, could our friends have been surprised?
Suddenly, the junk tilted to one side, and a small boat broke away and fled.
The longboats, full of soldiers, set off in pursuit, throwing a swarm of arrows towards it.
A few shots were fired from the boat.
- Let's run to their aid!" cried the prince.
Raïden had already turned the canoe round, and the other boat, which was with them, followed close behind.
- They won't be caught," said Raïden, turning his head as he rowed.
Indeed, the light dinghy was bouncing on the waves, while the heavier longboats, overloaded with men, were moving with great difficulty.
- The sinking junk! The sinking junk!" shouted Loo, clapping his hands.
Indeed, the last ship left standing sank slowly, then almost at once disappeared.
- Victory! Victory!" shouted the sailors around the prince.
- Victory!" came the reply from the pursued boat, which was getting closer and closer.
The three boats soon joined up.
- Let us be pursued," said the prince, "and let us not flee too quickly to give them any hope of reaching us.
A few shots were fired and several soldiers fell, who were immediately thrown into the sea to lighten the boats.
An arrow hit Raïden in the shoulder, but it had no strength left; it barely stung him and fell into the canoe.
- It was well aimed," said Raïden.
The moon was in the middle of the sky, but this polished mirror was fading, as if under the mist of a breath; it soon took on a shade of pink vermeil, then became cottony, and was no more than a white cloud. The blue and silver of the sky was invaded by a pale shade of amethyst that flowed rapidly from the horizon, and purple shivers ran across the sea.
It was daytime.
Behind the promontory, the prince's flotilla had heard the shots, which for them were a signal, and they immediately left the shore and unfurled their sails, which took on the lovely colour of peach blossom in the first rays of the sun.
As soon as the boats were within earshot, the Prince of Nagato, standing in the dinghy, shouted at the top of his voice:
- Surround those boats, cut off their retreat, take them prisoner!
Loo was overjoyed.
- After sinking the big boats, we're going to confiscate the small ones," he said.
The soldiers realised the danger, turned and began to flee. But how could they fight speed with their oars against those big sails inflated by the morning breeze?
The longboats were soon overtaken and overtaken.
The soldiers were lost. If they steered straight at them and with a single blow, one of these large boats could sink them in a second. They hurried to throw their weapons into the water as a sign of submission.
The men were hoisted aboard and then the boats collapsed and sank.
- Go and find your enormous mother at the bottom of the ocean!
shouted Loo as he watched them sink.
The three boats rejoined the flotilla. The prince and the sailors climbed back onto the big boats.
Loo then told those who had remained how the enemy junks had been sunk, how he had drowned in a hole and then risen to carry a sword like a lord.
We counted the prisoners who, resigned and with heads down, awaited their fate. There were fifty of them.
- The daring plan we formed has succeeded better than we could have hoped," said the prince; "I'm still amazed that it has come to fruition, but since Marisiten, the genius of battles, the god with six arms and three faces, has been so favourable to us, let's not rest yet: we must now surround the island of the Dragonfly and isolate it from the rest of the world, until such time as the army of the Siogun comes to relieve us.
- Good! good!" shouted the sailors, thrilled by their recent victory.
- How many soldiers are there on the island?" the prince asked one of the prisoners.
The soldier hesitated; he looked left and right, as if seeking advice. Suddenly, he decided to speak.
- Why should I hide it? There are two thousand of them.
- Then we won't have taken fifty prisoners, but two thousand!
Nagato's words were greeted with tremendous cheers. We set off. Soon the sake was flowing, and the sailors began to sing a war song, which they each sang to their heart's content, producing a deafening and joyous uproar.
The deepest consternation reigned on the island; people didn't want to believe what was happening: the junks, so strong and beautiful, suddenly sinking into the sea; the longboats full of soldiers not returning. All the sentries had seen was a frail dinghy, manned by three men who brazenly clung to the ship, banging their arms against its hull and fanning it, then fleeing, taunting them.
So there were no more ships; they even lacked the longboats and had no way of leaving the island. They had established themselves as if in a fortress, surrounded by a huge moat.
Protected by their war junks, it was indeed an excellent position. But now the fortress had become a prison for them; if help did not arrive soon, they would be lost. The chief who commanded these two thousand men
- ordered the two best boats to be chosen from among the wretched boats belonging to the islanders. When this order had been carried out, he put five men in each boat.
- You're going to leave in a hurry," he told them, "you're going to join the main army, and you're going to tell the general how distressed we are.
The boats set off, but when they were a short distance away, they saw a circle of large immobile sails closing the way.
The boats turned back.
We were blocked.
Sandaï had the supplies gathered. They took the cattle and the harvests of the inhabitants. There was enough to live on for eight days; what's more, fish could be caught.
- We must build large rafts and try to reach land at night without being seen," said the chief.
We set to work, felling trees and stripping them of their small branches, and so it went on for the rest of the day. They also worked at night, but the next morning they saw a luminous swarm on the Soumiossi coast.
It was General Harounaga's army.
This fine warrior was rather embarrassed. He did not know what to do in the face of an enemy separated from him by the sea.
The fleet of war was setting sail from Osaka; it was not yet ready to leave; if he had to wait for it to attack, the enemy could escape.
Harounaga had his troops camped by the sea, then his tent was pitched and he shut himself in to meditate.
In the meantime, the soldiers fired a few arrows towards the island as a salute; they fell into the water, as the island was out of range.
However, towards the middle of the day, a skilfully launched arrow fell in front of Harounaga's tent and hit the sand with a shudder.
A piece of paper was attached to the feathers of the arrow, which was plucked from the ground and carried to the general.
Harounaga unfolded the paper and read the following:
"Prepare to attack. The enemy is in your power. I have taken away his means of escape. I will provide you with the means to reach him.
This note was not signed.
The general left his tent and looked out to sea.
A fishing boat passed slowly between the island of Dragonfly and the coast of Soumiossi.
- Who could this note be from?" said Harounaga to himself. Are they making fun of me? Is this the vulgar boat they're offering me to transport my whole army?
But as he looked, other boats appeared on the sea; they came closer, they multiplied.
Harounaga counted them.
Good! good!" he said, the proposal became acceptable.
Get up, soldiers!" he shouted, "take up arms, here comes a fleet!
As soon as the movement of the troops was noticed, the boats moved towards the shore. The one carrying the Prince of Nagato was the first to reach the shore.
The prince recognised the general.
- Ah! it's that stupid Harounaga," he murmured.
Loo jumped to the ground. He had a magnificent sword at his belt.
- Twenty men per boat!" he shouted. There are forty of them, which will make eight hundred men for each crossing.
The general stepped forward.
- The Prince of Nagato!" he exclaimed.
- I'm here incognito," said the prince, "and all the glory of this adventure will be yours.
- A sovereign who exposes himself to the hazards of battle!
Harounaga exclaimed in surprise.
- I wage war as I please, without being subject to anyone, and I find a certain pleasure in these new emotions.
- You, who only liked feasts! parties!
- I like war better these days," said the prince, smiling.
Shots and confused clamour could be heard in the distance.
- What is this?" said the general.
- It's a false attack directed at the other side of the island, to encourage your soldiers to disembark.
- You could be a general as well as me," said Harounaga.
The prince smiled contemptuously, hiding it behind his fan.
The boats loaded with men left the coast, and the general climbed into the boat carrying the prince.
Loo had picked up a sort of trumpet and was blowing into it, leaning forward with all his might.
The soldiers of Hiéyas were waiting, massed on the shore, ready to oppose the landing with all their might; arrows began to fly on both sides.
The Prince of Nagato brought forward a boat full of men armed with rifles. They fired almost continuously at their enemies, who had no firearms.
On the shore, a furious hand-to-hand struggle ensued. Legs were thrust into the water; sabre blows sent foam flying. Sometimes two opponents would drag each other down, roll and disappear. Several corpses and a large number of arrows floated on the waves.
People clung to the boats, pushing them violently out to sea; a powerful stroke of the oar brought them back. Then we would hang from one side to capsize them. Hands clinging to the ledges were struck with sabres, blood spurted out and then, like torn shreds, dragged across the water.
As soon as a boat was empty, they would rush out to find more soldiers. Soon the partisans of the usurper were overwhelmed. They surrendered.
The dead and wounded were numerous. They were laid on the sand, bandaged and encouraged with gentle, fraternal words. Were they not brothers? Indeed, they wore the same uniform, they spoke the same language; some wept as they recognised friends in the enemy ranks. The defeated sat on the ground in an attitude of despondency, folding their hands on their knees and bowing their heads.
Swords and bows were gathered up in heaps and returned to the victors.
The Prince of Nagato and the General advanced into the interior of the island. Harounaga let the whip with its golden straps hang from his wrist, the scales of his armour clinked and rustled; he rested one hand on his hip.
- Bring in the leader of the rebels," said the prince.
Sandaï stepped forward.
He still had on the black patent leather mask that fits over the helmet and is worn in battle; he removed it and showed his saddened face.
Nagato's presence singularly disturbed this chief, who had once sought and obtained his protection from Fidé-
Yori. He had later attached himself to the regent out of ambition.
Now he was betraying his first lord.
Nagato's calm, contemptuous gaze brought home to him the infamy of his conduct; he understood that he could no longer hold his head high under the double humiliation of defeat and dishonour.
What's more, the prince seemed to him to be clothed in a special majesty.
In the midst of these armoured warriors, sheltering their foreheads under sturdy helmets, Ivakoura was bareheaded, dressed in a black silk robe with a golden ripple running through it.
above each arm a stiff breastplate, forming an epaulette and making his shoulders appear very broad. This made him look more formidable than anyone else.
The prince played nonchalantly with his iron fan.
He didn't seem to remember that he had ever known Sandaï.
- Rebel," he told him without raising his voice, "I'm not asking you if you want to renounce your crime and go back to being the servant of your true master: I know that pride outlives honour in man, and you would refuse.
- Prince," said Sandaï, "before the battle, your voice could have reminded me of my duties and thrown me at your feet; but, after defeat, a leader cannot renounce his deeds and serve his victor.
That's why I don't agree to submit.
- Well, I'm going to send you back to the master of your choice," said Nagato. You will go alone, without a page or a squire, to join Hiéyas and tell him this: General Harounaga defeated us, but it was the Prince of Nagato who sank the junks that could bring us back.
- Illustrious Daimio," said Sandaï without anger, "I am a general and not a messenger. I may have been guilty, but I am no coward; I know how to endure deserved insults without revolt, but I cannot survive them. Send another messenger to Hieyas, and let him add the news of my death to the news he will bring.
There was a great silence among the soldiers. They understood the general's intention and no one wanted to oppose his execution.
Sandai sat down on the ground; he drew his sabre and his dagger; then, after saluting the prince, he stretched out his stomach; thrust the dagger across his throat and, with one clean stroke, struck on the back of the blade, severed the artery; his head fell on his chest, amidst a stream of blood.
- This action relieves you in my eyes," said Nagato, who was perhaps
perhaps even heard by the dying man.
- Let this warrior be buried on the island, with all the pomp and ceremony his rank requires," said Harounaga.
Sandaï's body was raised.
- Now," said the prince, "I'm going to take a little rest. I'm beginning to remember that I spent the whole night running on the sea, and that my eyes didn't close for a second. The victory is as complete as possible; all that remains for you, Harounaga, is to establish communication between Soumiossi and the island you have conquered; you can do this with the help of rafts forming a sort of bridge. Send messengers to Fide-Yori, occupy the island and the coast, watch the sea and await further orders from Osaka.
- Thank you for this invaluable advice," said the general; "you are the real victor, will you allow me to let our beloved lord know?
lord?
- No," said the prince, "just let Hiéyas know, because I want my name to sound like a threat to him.
The Prince of Nagato left.
The night came, quiet and warm, then it passed and daylight returned.
Then General Harounaga came out of his tent and asked if the prince was awake. He was getting used to taking his orders and advice, so he didn't have to think: he had a thousand things to ask him.
We approached the tent that had been set up for Nagato; it was ajar; we looked inside, but the prince was not there.
- Perhaps he's gone back to his boat," said Harounaga.
We ran to the shore. The sea was empty, the Prince of Nagato's flotilla had disappeared.
XVIII
THE PRINCIPALITY OF NAGATO
Fatkoura had left with her entire household, all her baggage and a guard of honour given to her by the queen because of the dangers of the road. She had gone to Hagui, to her fiancé's castle.
The young woman felt a kind of cruel joy in the midst of the despair of her disappointed love.
- We are three unhappy people now," she said.
She had agreed to marry the prince out of a desire for revenge. Besides, could she refuse? What's more, everyone in the palace knew Fatkoura's feelings for the Prince of Nagato: she had let them be seen boldly in the pride of her joy, when she thought she was loved.
She left the court in a hurry, tired of showing a smiling mask to her friends, whose congratulations overwhelmed her.
During the journey, she looked at nothing of the charming country she was passing through, her gaze constantly fixed on the carpet of her norimono, deepening her pain.
Sometimes she called Tika in.
The young maid would crouch down opposite her and look at her with worried compassion. She would try to distract her from her painful dream.
- Look, mistress," she said, "look at the pretty absinthe-coloured river flowing between these velvety hills. Every shade of green is here: the pale willow, the dark cypress, the silver-glazed birch, the emerald-clear grass; each gives its own note. You see, to make it green too, the moss has invaded this water mill, whose image the river repeats; and over there these reeds that look like swords, and these ducks that flap their wings on the water and flee with outstretched necks, they are green like the whole landscape.
Fatkoura wasn't listening.
- He'll come back to you," said Tika, giving up trying to distract her mistress from her stubborn grief, "when you're his wife he'll love you again: you're so beautiful!
- He has never loved me and I don't want him to love me," said Fatkoura, "because I hate him.
Tika sighed.
- The only joy I have is knowing that he is suffering and that she too, the one who crushes me with her unparalleled power and beauty, is bitten by pain. They love each other and they can't admit it. I am yet another obstacle between them: if the mikado had died, she would have married him.
- A kisaki! marrying a prince," cried Tika.
- Are you forgetting," said Fatkoura, "that Nagato's grandfather was the first after the mikado? The Ivakoura insignia still say so, as they are made up of two Chinese characters meaning 'The first rank'. When I loved the prince, even the son of the gods could not have driven him from my heart.
- You love him more than ever," murmured Tika.
Sometimes Fatkoura felt sorry for herself, remembering the time when the happiness of being loved filled her soul, and she wept profusely.
But these tears didn't make her feel any better.
- I'm mad!" she said; "I'd like to cry on his shoulder; I'd like to pour my sorrow into that cruel, cold heart!
Then her anger returned.
At last she reached the town of Hagui, on the shores of the Sea of Japan. She passed through the magnificent gateway of the ancient fortress of the Princes of Nagato.
In the first courtyard, Ivakoura's father met her and greeted her in a friendly manner.
- Princess of Nagato," he said, "welcome home.
This lord was sixty years old, upright and strong; in the nobility of his features the young woman found something of Ivakoura's face. For several years the old prince had abdicated his power in favour of his eldest son; he was busy educating his youngest son, a child of thirteen, who was standing beside him at the moment, and on whose head he was resting his hand.
Fatkoura had to smile again and look happy.
She hid her mouth behind the sleeve of her dress, with that modest and affectionate movement familiar to Japanese women, then knelt for a moment before the lord.
He treated her paternally, installed her in the flats of honour, gave parties for her and organised hunts. He showed her his estates and gave her splendid gifts.
Fatkoura felt a strange sensation in this environment where everything spoke to her of her fiancé. She saw the room where he had been born, and was shown the toys that had been broken by his hands as a child, and his first clothes, which bore the memory of a form that was already graceful.
She was told a thousand charming stories of his adored childhood, then the heroic deeds of the adolescent, the young man, his literary successes, the nobility of his soul, his kindness, his devotion. The lord never dried up; the father's love tortured and fuelled the woman's painful love.
Then a kind of resignation came over her. By dint of hiding her pain, she buried it deep within herself and toned it down; she tried to forget that she was not loved; she found consolation in the strength of the feeling she felt.
- I love, she said to herself, that is enough; I will be content to see him, to hear him, to bear his name; I will be patient; perhaps time will heal him, he will then have pity on my long resignation, he will remember all that I have suffered for him; his heart will soften, he will love me; I will end my life, happy, close to him; I will be the mother of his children.
Soon there were rumours of war. Worry invaded everyone's hearts, the life of the absent man was in danger.
- Where is he now?" said Fatkoura.
- He's at the most dangerous post, I'm sure! replied the old lord.
He said this with pride, raising his head, but his voice trembled and tears came to his eyes.
The news became clearer. The princes of Figo and Toza were threatening Osaka; they were also threatening the province of Nagato.
Ivakoura's father set up an army and sent troops to the borders.
- We have an ally, the Prince of Aki," he said, "and besides, they won't attack us, they're not after us.
He was wrong. The soldiers he had sent had not yet reached the borders of the kingdom when the Prince of Toza was already landing on the coast of the Inland Sea.
Full of concern, the prince sent a deputation to the lord of Aki, his neighbour. The latter declared that he wished to remain neutral in this war.
- He's a traitor! an infamous one!" cried old Nagato, when his envoys brought him this reply; "well, we'll defend ourselves alone, without the hope of triumphing, it's true, but with the certainty of not diminishing the lustre of our ancient glory.
When he was alone with Fatkoura, the lord let his dejection show.
- I vow," he told her, "that my son will remain with the Siogoun and not return here. If he were here, he would be killed, and who would avenge us?
Riders entered the castle. The lord turned pale when he saw them. They wore Nagato's insignia on their shields.
- You bring news of my son?" he said in an uncertain voice.
- Illustrious lord, the Prince of Nagato is in good health," said a samurai. He is at the moment on the edge of his kingdom, busy gathering the army around him; he is going to march against the Prince of Figo.
- Aki is a traitor; does my son know that? said the lord.
- He knows, master. The prince has crossed the province ruled by this infamous man; he thought it was friendly, but he was attacked treacherously. Thanks to his unrivalled bravery, he dispersed the attackers, but half his baggage was lost.
- What orders did he tell you to pass on to us?
- Here, my lord; the Prince of Nagato asks you to make an extraordinary collection of troops and to send them to meet the Prince of Toza, who is advancing towards Chozan; then to double the defenders of the fortress, to stockpile supplies there and to lock yourself in; he also asks you to give me command of the troops you will send against Toza.
These orders were carried out with haste.
Events followed in quick succession. More messengers arrived. The Prince of Nagato had fought a battle to the north of the kingdom, in the territory of Souvo; the Lord of Souvo, a vassal of the Prince of Aki, had encouraged the landing of Figo's soldiers; but Ivakoura had driven these soldiers into the inland sea; many had drowned, the others had returned to the ships at anchor. Meanwhile, the small army of the lord of Souvo had attacked the prince from behind, trying to separate him from the province of Nagato, but this army had been completely defeated and the prince was able to return to his kingdom.
Now Figo, backed by new forces, had reappeared on the shores of Nagato, and Ivakoura was preparing to repel a second attack.
But while the Prince of Nagato was triumphing in the north of his domains, the Prince of Toza was invading them from the south.
The province of Nagato, the extreme tip of the island of Nipon, is bounded on three sides by the sea: to the south-east is the inland sea, separated from the Pacific Ocean by the island of Sikof and the island of Kiou-Siou.
Siou, to the west the Korean Strait, to the north the Sea of Japan, and to the east a chain of mountains separates it from the principalities of Souvo and Aki.
The prince of Toza had come from the island of Sikof via the Boungo canal, and had crossed the inland sea as far as Chozan; he wanted to cross the entire width of the province and march on Hagui, the capital, situated on the other side, on the shores of the Sea of Japan.
Toza met the hastily-raised troops sent by the old lord of Nagato, but these ill-trained troops bent before the invader's well-disciplined army; they retreated and fled back to Hagui.
Preparations were made for a siege.
The fortress stood some distance from the town on an elevation surrounded by a moat; from the top of its towers you could see the fields and the sea.
Soon Toza's army covered the plain.
The old lord watched from the top of the fortress.
- My daughter," he said to Fatkoura, "why didn't you stay in Kioto?
- My father," replied the young woman, "to be here in my husband's castle at a time when he is under threat is both my duty and my pleasure.
All her anger was gone, all she had left was love, she trembled for the life of her beloved, terrible anguish tortured her, and the arrival of a messenger did nothing to calm her.
- Since that man left her," she said to herself, "he could have died twenty times.
But the castle was blocked and the messengers stopped arriving.
The town put up stiff resistance and was taken on the fifth day; then the siege of the fortified castle began.
The Prince of Toza himself supervised the work of his soldiers.
First they built a long wooden roof covered with iron plates, then they raised it on very high posts and secured it. This made a sort of shed which they placed in the ditch. They then brought earth, stones and brush and threw them into the water. The arrows thrown at them bounced off the roof. Huge blocks of rock were pushed from the top of the eminence to crush this dangerous shelter; but as they rolled down the slope, their force was dampened and most of them fell into the ditch. They strengthened the work of the besiegers, who quietly filled in part of the ditch under the shield they had built for themselves.
They stopped throwing missiles from the top of the walls.
The soldiers tried to get out; they went down the path that wound like a ribbon around the hill, and approached the moat. To reach the place where the enemies were working, they had to leave the path, sheltered by a double row of cypress trees, and walk on the slippery grass that covered the steep slope of the hill.
The soldiers tried to do this, but they felt uncomfortable shooting, as they offered themselves up as targets for their opponents' blows. The wounded rolled and fell into the ditch.
They gave up and retreated into the walls. The attackers completed their work without being troubled; they made a fairly wide causeway that joined the foot of the hill and over which the army could pass.
The assault began.
The castle put up heroic resistance; it refused to capitulate.
On its crumbling walls, the besieged still defended themselves. The castle was invaded. The victors opened the gates, the bridges were lowered and the Prince of Toza entered Nagato Castle to the sound of triumphal music.
In the first courtyard he entered, the sight that struck his eyes made an unpleasant impression.
There had been no time to bury the dead; they had been gathered together in this courtyard. Sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall, there were a hundred of them; with their green faces, their mouths and eyes wide open, their arms hanging down: they were terrible.
The Prince of Toza imagined that they were watching him and forbidding him to enter. Being superstitious, he was on the verge of turning back.
However, he quickly overcame this weakness, entered a room in the palace and ordered the lord, his wives, his children and his entire household to be brought before him.
They soon appeared.
There were old women there, some accompanying their very old and trembling fathers, some young girls and children. The lord came forward, holding his son by the hand, Fatkoura walking beside him.
- If you want to destroy the women," said old Nagato, looking at Toza with contempt, "make haste to say so, so that I can curse you and bring all the afflictions upon you.
- I don't care whether these women live or die," cried Toza, "you yourself, having abdicated, are nothing, and I will spare your old age. I'm looking for a hostage among you who is valuable enough to be able to vouch for the submission of the Prince of Nagato, because after victory I can't settle in his lands, the war is calling me elsewhere. Who will I take," he continued, "the son or the father? The child is still very young and worthless; for want of anything better, I'll take the father.
- Then take me with him!" cried the child.
Fatkoura suddenly stepped forward.
Since you think the father is too old and the brother too young," she cried, "take the sovereign's wife prisoner, if you think she's worth missing.
- Of course I'll take you, because you must be passionately loved," said Toza, struck by Fatkoura's beauty.
- My daughter," murmured old Nagato, "why did you betray yourself? Why didn't you let me go?
- Is she really Ivakoura's wife?" asked the victor, troubled by a doubt.
- Every word that comes out of my mouth is the word of truth," said Nagato, "this woman is the wife of my aïs, since promises have been exchanged, only the war has delayed the wedding.
- Well, Ivakoura will come to fetch his fiancée from the castle of the princes of Toza, and the ransom he will have to pay to get her back will be proportionate to the value of the treasure I'm taking with me.
- What have you done? What have you done?" said the old prince, sighing. How dare I tell my son that his wife is a prisoner?
- Rejoice, on the contrary," said the Prince of Toza, "for you can see how magnanimous I am. I leave you alive, you and your son, and all those of your house, I allow you to raise the crumbling walls of your castle, and I am content with this one captive.
- I'm ready to follow you," said Fatkoura, happy to be sacred to the salvation of all.
- You will be treated by me as a sovereign should be.
That same evening, Fatkoura left Nagato's castle.
She tried in vain to hold back her tears as she passed through the gate in her norimono carried by the victor's people.
- I'll never go back to that house! she cried.
Tika was crying too.
When we were a short distance away, Fatkoura had the palanquin bearers stop and, leaning out of the window, she took one last look at Hagui's fortress, silhouetted against the red sky on the crest of the hill.
- Farewell! Farewell!" she cried, the last refuge of my tenacious hope. Behind your walls, castle of the beloved, I could still dream of a late and distant happiness, but it's over, I'm doomed to despair; the last light that shone for me is extinguished with the fading day.
We set off again and the castle disappeared. The Prince of Toza left half his army in Nagato's territory. Messengers told him that Figo had not been able to break through the enemy lines, but that on hearing the news of the siege of Hagui, Ivakoura had suddenly moved away to help the fortress. He had left during the night without a sound; in the morning the plain was deserted. Figo was going to pursue him, but victory would be certain if we could block the enemy's path and crush him between two armies.
Toza gave orders to the leaders of the troops he was leaving behind, then hurried to Chozan, where his ships were waiting. This lord did not want to leave his states undefended any longer: he feared the proximity of the Prince of Awa, whom he believed to be devoted to Fidé-Yori.
When the junks had left the coast and sailed inland towards the Boungo canal, the prince came to greet his prisoner. He had installed her in a superb tent at the stern of the most beautiful ship, the one he himself was riding. Fatkoura was seated on a bench covered with a rich carpet; her gaze was fixed on the shores of Nagato, disappearing into the light-flooded distance.
- Do you have a desire, beautiful princess?
Would you like to hear the sound of the flute or the biva?
- All my desires remain on this earth that I am leaving," she said.
I take only one with me, that of death.
- I respect your pain," said the prince, who withdrew. But he didn't go far; he strolled along the bridge and, as if in spite of himself, often returned to the tent where Fatkoura was staying. Tika watched him out of the corner of her eye.
He had changed out of his military costume and was dressed with a certain amount of finesse. The Prince of Toza was thirty years old, a little fat and short, with a bearded complexion that made the whiteness of his teeth stand out. His eyes, veiled by the fold of his eyelids raised towards his temples, had a certain softness about them.
Tika thought the prince was not without charm, and she half-smiled every time he let out a sigh or cast a furtive glance at Fatkoura, who was watching the ship's wake.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?" she said softly; "you think the Prince of Nagato is very happy to have such a fiancée, and you'd like to take her away from him. I guessed you right away.
As soon as you saw her at Hagui Castle, you couldn't take your eyes off her, and you took her away in all haste; you were afraid that the fiancé would arrive in time to snatch her away from you. But you are wasting your efforts, she will never love you... It's not that I don't wish for you," continued Tika, continuing her monologue, "but if she could recover and become Princess of Toza, I would be truly delighted. The Prince of Nagato, too, would gladly consent to this marriage, but you have no idea.
The Prince of Toza was also examining the young woman.
- Yes, yes, I understand," murmured Tika. You're looking at the rung that might help you get to her.
Soon the young girl got up and, as if to breathe more easily, walked out onto the deck; she leaned against the parapet and looked out over the sea.
Below, however, she was watching the Prince's movements.
- Oh, you'll come to me," she said, "I'm sure of it.
Let's see how you start the conversation?
The prince approached, slowly and hesitantly.
Tika looked off into the distance.
- The air is fresher here, isn't it, young lady?" said the prince at last, stopping in front of her.
- That's rather banal, thought Tika, who replied by inclining her head.
- Why doesn't your mistress go for a little walk?
Why doesn't she let the gentle breeze cool her brow?
- The wind that blows from the land of exile is hotter than a flame," said Tika in a solemn voice.
- Is it so terrible to live in one castle rather than another?" said the prince; "Fatkoura will be treated like a sovereign. I swear to you that I want her captivity to be sweeter than the freedom of another. Tell me what she likes.
- Hasn't she told you herself that she has no taste for anything? She used to love finery, parties and music; above all she loved to hear her fiancé's footsteps on the outside gallery.
- So she loves Nagato very much?
- He deserves to be loved, he's the most perfect lord there is.
- There are some who are well worth it," said Toza.
- You'd think!" exclaimed Tika incredulously, "I've never heard him say that.
- He loves her madly, doesn't he?
- How could anyone not love her!
- She's beautiful, it's true," said the prince, glancing at Fatkoura.
- You think she's beautiful, now that her eyes are drowned in tears, now that she disdains make-up and finery! If you had seen her when she was happy!
- I'll do everything I can to put a smile back on her face," says Toza.
- There's only one way to do that.
- And that is? You tell me.
- It's to return her to her husband.
- You're making fun of me," exclaimed the prince, frowning.
- Do you think I'm deceiving you and that this wouldn't be the best way to make my mistress happy? I know you won't use it, so you'll never see her smile.
- Well, she'll stay sad," said Toza, "I'll keep her close to me.
- Alas!" sighed Tika.
- Shut up!" exclaimed the prince, stamping his foot, "why do you say: alas! what does it matter to you whether you serve her here or there, don't you see that she has charmed me and that I am unhappy?
The prince walked away after saying these words, while Tika pretended to be deeply stunned.
- I didn't think you'd be so quick to confide in me," she murmured when he had gone, "I had guessed you, but you don't yet suspect that I want to protect your love.
Tika returned to sit at her mistress's feet.
- You're leaving me alone to talk to our jailer," said Fatkoura.
- It was he who came to talk to me, mistress," said Tika, "and in the space of a few minutes he taught me some very strange things.
- What did he tell you?
- Do I have to tell you? You won't be angry?
- I don't know; just say it.
- Well, you're the jailer, he's the prisoner.
- What are you trying to say?
- That the Prince of Toza loves Fatkoura and that, if she knows how, she'll do whatever she wants with him.
- What does it matter to my contempt whether he loves me or hates me?" said Fatkoura, turning her head away.
- He's not so contemptible," said Tika, "he's a very powerful and illustrious prince.
- You talk like that about our mortal enemy, Tika? said Fatkoura, looking at her sternly.
- Don't scold me," said Tika caressingly, "I can't help hating him less since I know that your grace has subjugated him and that, in the space of a few hours, you have invaded his heart.
- Yes, you think that another, on the contrary, turns his eyes away from me, and you are grateful to this one for repairing the insult done to me! said Fatkoura, hiding her forehead in her hand.
As the sea was beautiful and the journey easy, instead of crossing the land, they skirted the coast of the island of Sikof, rounded the Cape of Toza and, after sailing northwards for a few hours in the Pacific Ocean, the junks entered the port of Kotsi. The town was abuzz with banners, streamers and lanterns, and the streets were strewn with blossoming branches. The sovereign, at the head of his victorious troops, was making a triumphal return.
When they had passed the town and the castle walls, the prince himself led Fatkoura to the pavilion he had intended for her. This was the palace of the Queen of Toza, who had died a few years earlier.
- I am very sorry that the joyful clamour that greeted me has struck your ear," said the prince to his prisoner; "I could not object to my people expressing their satisfaction, but I was suffering because of you.
- I heard nothing, my thoughts were elsewhere," replied Fatkoura.
The prince did not visit the young woman for several days. His budding love made him shy, and he was surprised by this new feeling for him.
One morning he went for a walk alone in the part of the park occupied by Fatkoura.
Tika was watching him; she said nothing to her mistress and let herself be seen on the gallery. The prince beckoned her to come close to him, and she obeyed.
- Is she always so sad?
- She always is.
- She hates me, doesn't she?
- I don't know," said Tika.
- I let slip the other day in front of you a confession that I should have kept quiet," said the prince.
- I'm in the habit of keeping nothing from her, my lord.
- Ah!" asked the prince sharply, "what did she say when she learned of my love for her?
- She said nothing; she hid her face in her hands.
The prince sighed.
- I want to see her at all costs! For three days I've been depriving myself of her presence and I'm overwhelmed with boredom, I've forgotten too much that I'm the master.
- I'll tell him you're coming," said Tika, who rushed back into the house.
A moment later Toza appeared before Fatkoura. He found her even more beautiful than the last time he had seen her; sadness ennobled her beauty; her complexion, free of make-up, showed her feverish pallor, and her eyes had a resigned and proud expression that was most touching.
The prince was moved before her and remained silent. She greeted him by raising the sleeve of her dress to the height of her mouth.
It was she who spoke first.
- If you have any pity in your soul," she said in a voice shaking with tears, "don't leave me in this terrible uncertainty, give me news of my husband!
- I fear to sadden you even more by telling you news that is good for me and bad for you, since you are my enemy.
- I implore you!" exclaimed Fatkoura in horror.
- Well then, the army of the Prince of Figo, assisted by my soldiers, has triumphed over the Prince of Nagato, who defended himself heroically, I admit; at the moment he must be a prisoner; the latest news tells me that with barely a hundred men, Nagato has entrenched himself in a small wood, my troops have surrounded him and he cannot escape.
Fatkoura bowed her head in dismay. She couldn't believe it, she couldn't imagine him unhappy. In her eyes he always triumphed, he was the first, the most beautiful, the most noble: how could he be a prisoner, anyway, when he could escape captivity through death?
She looked up at the Lord of Toza, doubting his words.
- You are hiding the truth from me," she said with a frightening intensity of gaze, "you want to prepare me for the fatal blow of his death?
- I spoke frankly," said Toza; "he will be taken alive.
But I want to give you some advice: forget this man," he added, irritated by Fatkoura's pain.
- Me, forget him!" she cried, clasping her hands together.
- I have to, it's all over for him. Do you think I'm going to set him free, the one that Hiéyas hates so much that he's going to be the first in the kingdom, the man who will free him from this adversary, the one who has humiliated us all with his luxury, his wit, his beauty; the one you love at last, and who is my rival, because I love you?
- You love me!" exclaimed Fatkoura in horror.
- Yes," sighed the prince, "and I had come to say sweet words to you; but you have led me to speak of things I did not want to say. I know that my love will be hateful to you at first, but you must get used to it; it is not offensive to you. I am free and I offer to be your wife. Just think, the Prince of Nagato no longer exists.
Toza withdrew, so as not to hear Fatkoura's reply. He was irritated with her and displeased with himself.
- I was brutal, he thought, I didn't say the right thing, but jealousy suddenly bit me in the heart; it's a very violent torture that I've never experienced before.
He wandered around the gardens for the rest of the day, bullying anyone who came near him.
- She'll never want to love me," he said to himself, "I have no way of taming her heart; but if the Prince of Nagato falls into my hands, I'll take my revenge on him.
Fatkoura couldn't stay still either; she went from one room to another in her flats, wringing her hands and weeping silently. She didn't dare ask any more questions, but every hour that passed increased her anxiety.
One night, she heard an unusual noise in the castle. Bridges were being lowered and the clash of armour sounded.
She got up and ran to a window; she saw lights shining through the trees.
- Get up, Tika," she said, waking the young girl; try to slip in unseen and hear what's being said; try to find out what's going on in the castle.
Tika dressed quickly and left the pavilion silently.
Her mistress followed her with her eyes, but she soon disappeared into the darkness.
When she returned, she was very pale and pressed her hand to her heart.
- The Prince of Nagato has just entered the palace," she said, "I saw him pass between the soldiers, he's in chains and they've stripped him of his weapons.
At these words, Fatkoura let out a loud scream and fell to the floor.
- Could she be dead?" exclaimed a frightened Tika, kneeling down beside her mistress.
Her heart was beating rapidly, but her eyes were closed and she was cold and motionless.
- What to do? What to do?" said Tika, who did not dare to call out, her mistress having forbidden her to let any of the servants placed at her disposal by the Prince of Toza go near her.
She fainted for a long time. When Fatkoura opened her eyes again, it was daylight. She looked at Tika for a moment in surprise, but her memory quickly returned. She stood up abruptly.
- We've got to save him, Tika," she cried with feverish excitement, "we've got to get him out of this castle.
- Has she gone mad?" said Tika.
- Let's get out," continued Fatkoura; "let's find out which part of the palace he's locked up in.
- The sun hasn't yet drunk the morning vapours, and people will be suspicious of us if they see us walking around so early, especially as you haven't left your flat once since we've been here.
- Anyway, you'll say that the fever drove me out of bed.
Let's go.
Fatkoura went down into the garden and started walking ahead of her. The grass was all wet, the trees and bushes were bathed in a pink atmosphere that blended with the sky, and the highest roofs of the castle's great tower were already receiving the sun's rays and glistening with dew.
Tika followed her mistress. They arrived at the palisade surrounding their private enclosure, the gate closed only at the latch, the prisoners were free in the well-guarded fortress.
The soldiers who had brought the Prince of Nagato were camped out in the alleys of the park; most of them were sleeping on their stomachs, their heads in their arms; others, crouched around a dying fire, were eating rice from large bowls wrapped in straw.
- Tika," said Fatkoura, looking at these men and the weapons shining beside them, "a sword is a faithful companion that opens the door to the next life and allows you to escape dishonour. The victor took the dagger I carried with me. Try to steal the sword from one of these soldiers.
- Mistress!" said Tika, casting a frightened glance at the young woman.
- Obey," said Fatkoura.
- So, let's get away from those who are awake, and stay back - the sound of your dresses could give us away.
Tika sank down between the clumps of flowers, then stretched out on the grass and lay down as far as she could towards a soldier lying at the edge of the path. He was sleeping on his back, his nose in the air, his sabre lying beside him.
The young girl touched the weapon with her fingertips, her nails against the scabbard making a small noise; Tika's heart was beating very fast.
The soldier didn't stir.
She moved forward a little more and grabbed the sword by the middle, then backed away slowly, sliding on the grass.
- I've got it, mistress!" she said casually, turning back to Fatkoura.
- I'll feel calmer with this defender beside me.
Fatkoura hid the sword against her chest and then started walking again, at random, getting lost.
Suddenly she found herself a few steps from the palace inhabited by the Prince of Toza; people were coming and going and she could hear the sound of voices.
She listened carefully.
She caught a few words and understood that the prince was being congratulated on the capture he had just made. The inferiors spoke in half voices, respectfully, and Fatkoura could not hear very well, but the Prince of Toza spoke loudly, and then she heard only too well.
- I thank you," he said, "for taking part in the joy caused me by this event; Nagato is the most bitter enemy of our great Hiéyas, so it is a glory for me to free him from this hated adversary: I have condemned him to the ultimate torture, he will be executed tomorrow, at midday, within the walls of the fortress, and his head will be taken to Hiéyas on my behalf.
Fatkoura had the strength not to scream. She went to join Tika, she knew enough. Her pallor was frightening, but she was calm, she pressed the sword against her flesh, it hurt, but it calmed her.
- I beg you, go back inside, mistress," said Tika; "if you were caught, they'd take us into their confidence and lock us up.
- You're right," said Fatkoura, "but I absolutely must know which part of the palace Nagato was taken to. They want to kill him, they're condemning him to an ignominious death. If I can't save him, I'll at least give him something to die for nobly.
- I can go unnoticed," said Tika, "I can talk to the servants without arousing suspicion, and I'll find out what you want to know.
Fatkoura returned to the palace and, overwhelmed, let herself fall onto the cushions, almost without a thought.
Tika was absent for a long time; when she returned, her mistress was still in the same place, motionless.
- Well, Tika?" she said as soon as she saw the young girl.
- I know where it is, mistress, I was shown from a distance the pavilion that houses it, I'll take you there.
- Come on," said Fatkoura, rising to her feet.
- Are you thinking about it?" exclaimed Tika; it's still broad daylight and we have to wait for nightfall.
- That's right," said Fatkoura, "let's wait.
She fell back down again.
Until evening she remained motionless, speechless, her gaze fixed on the same spot on the floor.
When it was quite dark, she got up.
- Let's go," she said.
Tika said nothing and went ahead. They passed through the gardens again, skirting other houses and courtyards; the young girl oriented herself by occasionally looking up at the great tower, on which a lantern shone.
- See that pavilion with the two roofs? You can see them against the sky. That's the place.
- The window is lit," said Fatkoura, "he's there; is that really possible? defeated, a prisoner, ready to die.
They moved on.
- Are there any soldiers?" asked Fatkoura in a low voice.
- I don't know," said Tika, "I can't see anyone.
- If I can't talk to him, I'll throw the sword through that open window in front of him.
They continued walking, down a small slope.
Suddenly Fatkoura felt a strong arm embrace her and pull her back.
- One more step and you'd fall into a deep ditch that's right there on the ground," said a voice.
Fatkoura recognised the Prince of Toza.
- It's all over," she murmured.
He was still holding her and she made every effort to free herself from his embrace, but she was unable to do so.
- This is how you thank me for saving your life," he said.
Fortunately, I was warned about the walk you were going to take this evening, and I followed you to keep you out of danger. Do you think, then, that your every word and your every move have not been faithfully reported to me? Do you think that I was unaware of your insane plan to free your fiancé or to provide him with a means of escaping my vengeance?
- Let me go, infamous Fatkoura moaned as she struggled.
- No," said the prince, "you will remain on my heart. The touch of your supple waist enchants me. I am determined to love you in spite of yourself.
But I want to make one last attempt to win your love. Grant me this and I will allow you to take the sword you stole from one of my soldiers to Nagato.
- This proposal is worthy of you," said Fatkoura scornfully.
- Are you refusing?
- The Princess of Nagato will not dishonour her name.
- Then you'll have to give me back this weapon," said the prince, who himself took it from Fatkoura's chest, "you could escape me by dying, which would be a bitter grief for me.
Think about the proposal I have just made to you, and you have until tomorrow to make up your mind. Until the time of the execution, which you will attend, it will be in your power to give your husband a gentler death.
The prince led the young woman back to his palace, then left her.
She was so overwhelmed by fear and despair that it seemed as if she no longer existed.
Her sleep was full of nightmares, but all the terror that fever dreams can give rise to was less horrible than reality. When she awoke, her first thought was to clench her heart and bathe her forehead in a cold sweat.
The Prince of Toza asked her what she had decided, and what kind of death the Lord of Nagato should be prepared for.
- Tell Toza," replied the princess proudly, "that he must stop insulting me by pretending to believe that I am capable of tarnishing the name of Nagato by committing an infamous deed.
He was then told that the execution would take place in front of his windows, just as the sun began to sink towards the west.
- Perhaps this odious lord imagines", said Fatkoura when she was alone again with Tika, "that I will survive the death of someone dearer to me than myself. He believes that the blow that will strike him before my very eyes will not kill me. He doesn't know what a woman's heart is.
Tika, appalled, said nothing. Sitting at her mistress's feet, she let her tears flow.
People came and went in front of the house, many footsteps making the sand crunch.
Fatkoura went over to the window and peered through the blind.
Poles were being planted all around the bare square that stretched out in front of the palace. Men on ladders struck the ends of the poles with mallets to drive them into the ground. Then black lacquer boxes with silver corners were brought in and white silk draperies were taken from them and hung on the posts, so as to enclose the square on all three sides in a fabric wall. Several mats were spread out on the ground, with a white one in the middle, bordered by a red fringe; the condemned man was to sit on this mat. A folding chair was placed under Fatkoura's window for the Prince of Toza, who wanted to watch the execution.
The unfortunate young woman walked feverishly around her room, moving away from the window and then returning to it against her will. Her teeth were chattering; a sort of horrible impatience was agitating her: she was terrified of waiting.
Soldiers arrived in the square, followed by samurai, vassals of the Prince of Toza.
They gathered in groups and, resting their hands on their swords, chatted in hushed tones, loudly criticising their lord's conduct.
- To refuse Hara-Kiri to one of the noblest of Japan's sovereigns, I can't understand that decision," said one.
- It's never been done before," said another, "even by simple samurai like us.
- He wants to send the head of the Prince of Nagato to Hiéyas.
- Once the prince had taken justice into his own hands, we could cut the head off the corpse in secret, without dishonouring the memory of the condemned nobleman.
- The lord of Toza undoubtedly has a motive for hatred against Nagato.
- No matter! Hatred is no excuse for injustice.
When the time came for the execution, the blinds were raised in Fatkoura's palace.
The distraught young woman fled to the back of the flat; she hid her head in the folds of a satin drapery to be blind and deaf, to muffle the burst of her sobs.
But suddenly she stood up and wiped her eyes.
- Come, Tika," she cried, "this is not how the wife of Ivakoura should behave; I will know how to lock up my pain within myself, help me to get to that window.
When she appeared leaning on Tika, a great silence fell over those present, a silence full of respect and compassion.
The Prince of Toza arrived at the same time and raised his eyes to hers, but she looked at him with such hatred and contempt that he lowered his head.
He came and sat down on the folding table and motioned for the prisoner to be brought forward.
He soon came forward, nonchalantly, with a disdainful smile on his lips; he had been released from his chains and was playing with his fan.
Two executioners walked behind him, bare-legged, dressed in black tunics tightened by a belt with a long sabre running through it.
He put his foot on the white mat that would, a few minutes later, be reddened by his blood, then raised his head.
Fatkoura gasped.
The man before her was not the Prince of Nagato.
The gaze of the infatuated woman, which had so often and for so long rested on the face of the beloved, could not be mistaken, even by a resemblance that deceived everyone.
She didn't hesitate for a minute. She found neither the radiance of his eyes, nor the melancholy of his smile, nor the pride of his brow, of the man who filled her heart.
- I knew he couldn't be defeated and humiliated," she said to herself, overcome by a wild joy that she could hardly conceal.
The sentence was read to the prisoner.
It condemned him to have his hands and then his head cut off.
- The infamy you have just told me dishonours you," cried the condemned man. My hands have only ever committed noble deeds and do not deserve to be detached from the arms that guided them. But invent the torments that please you, torture me as you please, I remain the prince and you lower yourself to the rank of executioner. I fought with all my might against the enemies of our rightful lord; you betrayed him for another who betrayed him, and you came underhandedly, without any reason for war between us, to attack my kingdom. You wanted my head in order to get a good price for it from Hiéyas; the dishonour is yours. I don't care about your ridiculous sentence!
- Who is this man who speaks with such courage?
Fatkoura asked himself.
The samurai approved of the prisoner's words, but let the Prince of Toza see their displeasure.
- Don't deny him the death of nobles," they said, "he has done nothing to deserve such rigour.
Toza was furious.
- I don't think my revenge is enough," he said through clenched teeth, "I'd like to find something even more terrible.
- But you can't think of anything," laughed the condemned man, "you've always lacked imagination. Do you remember when you used to follow me to the parties, to the joyous adventures I used to organise? You never knew how to invent anything, but your mind of the next day remembered our minds of the day before.
- Enough!" cried Toza, "I'll rip off your flesh with pliers and pour boiling pitch into your wounds.
- All you've found there is an improvement on the moxas invented by doctors: look further, it's not enough.
- I can't explain this man's heroic behaviour," thought Fatkoura; "he knows he's being mistaken for someone else and he's playing a role that's going to lead him to a terrible death.
She wanted to shout the truth, to say that this man was not the Prince of Nagato; but she thought she would not be believed; besides, since he was silent himself, he must have had serious reasons for acting like this.
- I swear that you will be avenged in a resounding manner," she cried.
It is the wife of the Prince of Nagato who makes this oath and she will keep it.
- Thank you, divine princess," said the condemned man, "you, the only regret left in the world I am leaving; tell my master that I died cheerfully for him, seeing in the ill-satisfied rage of my executioner proof of our superiority and future glory.
- You shall speak no more," exclaimed the Prince of Toza, gesturing to the executioner.
Sado's head was severed with a single blow.
A stream of blood flooded the white mat. The body fell.
Fatkoura could not hold back a cry of horror.
The samurai turned their heads away, frowning. They walked away after silently saluting the Prince of Toza.
Full of anger and shame, he shut himself away in his palace.
That same evening, a messenger carrying a bloody head, wrapped in red silk and enclosed in a straw sack, left Toza castle.
XIX
A BURIAL
The news of General Harounaga's victory at Soumiossi had quickly reached Osaka. Yodogimi herself had come with impetuous joy to announce it to Fidé-Yori. She made no secret of her pride in her lover's triumph. Soon, however, peasants arriving from Soumiossi recounted in detail the events of the battle. The name of the Prince of Nagato replaced that of Harounaga everywhere.
Yodogimi forbade the repetition of such slander under severe penalties; she lost her temper and tired her son with wild recriminations. Fidé-Yori let her have her say, praising Harounaga loudly and thanking his faithful friend, whose devotion was unquenchable.
Unfortunately, other events, sad ones this time, came to erase the joy caused by the first victory: Hiéyas did not make any of the movements that had been planned, he did not attack Osaka from the south; General Signénari was therefore inactive on the island of Avadsi and yet no one dared to call him back. Nor did the usurper try to break the lines which barred the island of Nipon: his army, divided into small detachments, came by sea, landed at various points on the coast near Osaka, then, at night, surprised and captured a position.
Hachisuka, general of Hiéyas, captured a village near the capital in this way. The news spread throughout Osaka, causing widespread alarm. The siogun's soldiers had been massacred. At the time of the attack, their leader, Oussouda, was absent, drinking sake in a nearby teahouse.
General Sanada-Sayemon-Yoké-Moura wanted to attack the victors immediately and try to dislodge them from the conquered position. Fidé-Yori begged him not to.
- Your army is not large enough to lay siege to a village," he told him, "and if by misfortune you were defeated, the town would be defenceless. Call back the troops you sent to Yamasiro, and until we arrive let's content ourselves with defending Osaka.
Yoké-Moura reluctantly obeyed. He had clever spies keep an eye on the enemy.
Soon Yamasiro's troops returned. A battle was imminent. However, this time it was Yoké-Moura who refused to leave the city and give battle.
He would not even leave the fortress; he could be seen wandering around day and night, restless, worried, seemingly looking for something. At night especially, accompanied only by his son Daïské, who was only sixteen, he wandered relentlessly along the first wall.
The sentries, who saw him pass and pass again, with his son carrying a lantern, understood nothing of his behaviour and believed that the general had gone mad.
Every now and then Yoké-Moura rushed to his knees and pressed his ear to the ground.
Daïské held his breath.
Once, the general stood up quickly, all moved.
- Is it my blood ringing in my ears? he said; I thought I heard something. Listen, my son, and see if I'm not mistaken.
The child knelt down and put his ear to the ground.
- Father," he said, "I can clearly hear distant, muffled, regular knocks.
The general listened again.
- Yes, yes," he said, "I can hear them very well too; they're the blows of a pickaxe against the earth, it's there! We've got them, we're saved from a terrible danger!
- What is it, Father?" asked Daïské.
- What it is! The soldiers of Hiéyas are busy building an underground passage from their camp, passing under the town and the moat, and ending up here.
- Is this possible?" exclaimed Daïské.
- Luckily, a spy warned me about the work they were doing, but no one knew where the tunnel would end up. If I had left the castle, as Fide-Yori wanted, we would have been lost.
Yori wanted, we were lost.
- It was time to find out where they had chosen to invade the fortress," said Daïské, who was still listening.
- They still have a day's work ahead of them," said Yoké-Moura.
Now that I know where they are, I'll keep an eye on them. But follow
But follow me, my son; I want to entrust to you alone the delicate mission that must now be carried out.
The General returned to the pavilion he lived in at the castle.
He wrote a long letter to the man in command of the troops who had returned from Yamasiro; his name was Aroufza and he was Harounaga's brother. He gave this leader all the necessary instructions for the next day's battle.
When he had finished, he called a peasant who was waiting in the next room.
- This man knows where the underground begins", Yoké-Moura told his son, "when the time comes, he will lead the army there. You will leave with him; try not to be seen by anyone; you will take this letter to Aroufza, and tell him that he must carry out my orders scrupulously and allow himself to be guided by this man. Be careful, be skilful, my son; it is easy to reach Arufza's camp; but remember that we must reach it without being seen, so as not to arouse the spies that Hiéyas undoubtedly has among us. As soon as you arrive, send a messenger to me.
- I'll leave straight away and take advantage of the darkness," said Daïské. "In a few hours, Father, you'll have news from me.
The young man left with the spy.
As soon as daylight came, Yoké-Moura went to the siogoun to greet him.
Fidé-Yori received him coldly; he was unhappy with the general and could not explain his inaction.
- Yoké-Moura," he told him, "my confidence in your great valour and your devotion to me alone prevent me from ordering you to begin the attack immediately. Here are three great days lost. So what are you doing? Why are you lingering like this?
- I couldn't start until I'd found something I was looking for," said Yoké-Moura.
- What does this mean?" exclaimed the Siogun, seized by a terrible anxiety.
He in turn wondered if the general had lost his mind; he looked at him, the warrior's face expressed a joyful tranquillity.
- I have indeed been told," continued Fidé-Yori, "that for some time you have been wandering night and day like a madman.
- I'm resting now," said the general, "I've found what I was looking for.
The siogun bowed his head.
- Decidedly, he thought, he is mad.
But Yoké-Moura answered his question.
- Wait until tomorrow to judge me," he said, "and don't worry, master, if you hear any noise tonight.
After saying these words, he left and went to give orders to his soldiers.
He ordered two thousand men out of the town, who went to camp on a small hill in view of the enemy.
- People were preparing to attack, Osaka was saying.
The people invaded the hills, the pagoda towers and all the high places.
Fide-Yori himself climbed, with a few courtiers, to the top floor of the great Tower of the Golden Fish, in the centre of the fortress.
From there he could see Aroufza's soldiers on the plain, around eight thousand men, and further away, indicated by a few glimmers of weapons and armour, the enemies camped near a small wood. On the seaward side, in the bay, the fleet of war was just setting sail; closer by, the streets of the town, cut by innumerable canals like azure ribbons, were filled with anxious crowds. Work had been suspended; everyone was waiting.
The troops stayed put.
Fidé-Yori was getting tired of watching: a dull irritation was beginning to grow inside him. He sent for Yoké-Moura.
- The general is nowhere to be found," he was told. "His army is under arms, ready to come out at the first signal, but so far only two thousand men have left the fortress.
Finally, towards evening, the enemy made a move. They advanced towards the town. Immediately, the soldiers placed on the hill by Yoké-Moura rushed down. A few shots rang out and the battle began. The enemy was outnumbered. At the first impact, they drove back the men of the siogoun.
- Why doesn't Aroufza move?" said the siogoun; "is it treason? I really don't understand what's going on.
Many hurried footsteps were heard in the tower, and suddenly Yoké-Moura came out onto the platform.
He was holding a large bale of rice straw in his arms. The men following him were carrying brush.
The general briskly pushed aside the courtiers and even the siogoun.
He formed a huge pyre and set it alight.
The flame soon rose up, clear and brilliant; its glow illuminated the tower and made it impossible to see across the plain, which the twilight was invading.
Yoké-Moura, leaning over the balustrade, shielded his eyes with his hands and tried to pierce the gloom with his gaze.
- Good," he said.
And he went back down quickly, without answering the many questions that were put to him.
He took up position some distance from the point where the underground passage was to end. It was finished, because since the middle of the day the digging had stopped; only a thin layer of earth had been left, which was to be drilled at the last moment.
When night fell, the general listened carefully and heard the hum of footsteps; the enemy had entered the underground. That's when the flame was lit on the tower. At this signal, Aroufza was to move off and attack the enemy at the other end of the underground passage.
Night had fallen. Yoké-Moura and his soldiers waited in the deepest silence.
At last, small knocks began to be heard. The knocking was done carefully, to produce as little noise as possible.
The general and his men stood motionless in the shadows, listening intently. They could hear the earth falling in clods, then it cracked and the sound of breathing could be heard.
Soon a man's torso emerged from the opening, standing out against a shadow that was deeper than the darkness. He went out, another followed.
No one moved.
They moved forward cautiously, looking all round, and about fifty of them were let out; then suddenly, with ferocious cries, they were rushed on. They tried to retreat towards the underground.
- We've been betrayed!" they shouted to their companions.
Do not advance, flee.
- Yes, traitors, your deeds have been discovered," said Yoké-Moura, "and you have dug your own grave.
All those who had emerged from the underground were massacred. The cries of the dying filled the palace.
People ran with lights. Fide-Yori himself came between two hedges of torch-bearing servants.
- This is what I was looking for, master," said the general, showing him the gaping hole. Now do you think I did the right thing in not leaving the fortress?
The Siogun was dumb with surprise at the danger he had run into.
- No one will ever get out of there alive!
- But I think they'll escape through the other exit," said Fidé-Yori.
- You were surprised just now by Aroufza's immobility on the plain: he was waiting for the best part of the enemy army to enter this path before closing the gate on them.
- Then they're lost!" said the siogun. Forgive me, bravest of my warriors, for having doubted you for a moment, but why didn't you warn me of what was going to happen?
- Master," said the general, "spies are everywhere: there are spies in the fortress, in your palace, in my room. One surprised word and they were warned. At the slightest noise, the bird they wanted to catch flies away.
No one ventured further underground.
- They think they can escape," said Yoké-Moura; "they'll come back when they realise their retreat is cut off.
Soon, in fact, cries of distress were heard. They were so heart-rending that Fidé-Yori shuddered.
- The unfortunates," he murmured.
Their situation was horrible indeed: in this narrow corridor, where two men could barely advance abreast, where breathing was difficult, these distraught soldiers, mad with fear, were pushing each other, crushing each other in the darkness, desperate for light, even the light of night, which would have seemed brilliant next to this sinister shadow.
A terrible push pushed some of the men out of the underground passage and they fell under the soldiers' swords.
In the midst of the cries, these words could be heard confusedly:
- We surrender.
- Open up and let us out.
- No," said Yoké-Moura, "no mercy for traitors like you. I told you, you dug your own grave.
The general had stones and earth brought in to fill the opening.
- Don't do this, I implore you," said Fidé-Yori, pale with emotion, "these cries are tearing my heart apart; they are asking to surrender; let's take them prisoner, that's enough.
- You don't have to beg me, master," said Yoké-Moura; "your words are my orders. Whoa, you lot," he added, "stop shouting, you're being pardoned; you can get out.
The shouting redoubled.
It was impossible to get out. The terrifying thrust had suffocated many of the men, and the corpses blocked the opening; they formed a compact rampart, swelling from moment to moment, impassable. All had to perish; their groans made the ground tremble; they crushed each other, biting each other, their sabres digging into their ribs; their breastplates shattered with their bones; they died in the midst of an intense shadow, suffocated in a sepulchre that was too narrow.
They tried in vain to clear the entrance from outside.
- What a horrible thing, war!" cried Fidé-Yori, who fled in shock.
Soon the cries became less frequent, and then there was complete silence.
- It's over, they're all dead," said Yoké-Moura, "all that remains is to close the grave.
Five thousand men had perished in this underground passage several leagues long.
XX
THE MESSAGERS
Hiéyas himself had advanced, with fifty thousand men, a few leagues from Soumiossi. He had come by sea, passing very far from the coast so as not to be seen by the soldiers of Massa-Nori, camped on the banks of the province of Issé.
Hiéyas was quickly aware of all the defence plans put in place by the Fidé-Yori generals, and he did his utmost to thwart all the predictions of his adversaries. He let them blockade Nipon Island and, setting sail, he advanced behind their lines and landed between Osaka and Kioto. His aim was to lay siege to Osaka as quickly as possible, the capture of which would put an end to the war.
Although he was ill, he had come this far to be at the very heart of the struggle, his weakened nerves unable to withstand the feverish wait for news.
It was he who had devised the idea of digging an underground passage under the town and the moats to penetrate the fortress; he knew that it could not be impregnated by force, and this bold attempt could succeed. The loss of the two thousand soldiers taken on Dragonfly Island had upset him, but the success of General Hachisuka in capturing a village close to Osaka consoled him. He waited impatiently for the outcome of the adventure, sitting in his tent, looking out over the ocean, which was shaking the war junks. The sea was very rough; a stormy wind blew in from the open sea and raised high waves whose sharp tops foamed.
It was not good weather for small boats, for fishermen's boats.
The Prince of Nagato's fleet was at sea.
It had set off from Soumiossi with the intention of getting closer to the point occupied by the enemy, to see if they were in force and if Hiéyas had really advanced that far. Nagato didn't want to believe it.
But the wind picked up and suddenly became furious.
- Let's head for land, and quickly," cried Raïden, looking at the horizon from which slate-coloured clouds rose like mountains.
- Do you think we can't hold out to sea?" asked the prince.
- If we're still here in an hour, we'll never see land again.
- Luckily, the gust is blowing in from the open sea," said Nata, "and we'll be pushed straight to the coast.
- Come on," said Nagato, "especially as the boat's speed doesn't suit me very well. Will it last like this?
- Certainly," said Raïden, "the sail will support us a little, but we'll be dancing.
- The wind will blow me away," said Loo, who was piling up bundles of ropes and chains to make himself heavier.
We hoisted the sail and began to flee; the boat leapt up, then seemed to sink, leaning to the right or left, the sail touching the water. You could no longer see the horizon on either side, but only a succession of hills and valleys that distorted and reformed, sometimes a wave jumped into the boat and fell with a sharp noise, as if a bunch of stones had been thrown.
Loo was stunned by the breath of the wind, which never drew breath and sent a shower of foam in his face; he found on his lips the salty taste that had so displeased him when he had almost drowned.
- Pass me the bailer," said Nata, "the boat is full of water.
Loo looked for a moment.
- I can't find it," said Loo, "I can't see a thing, the wind is blowing my eyelashes into my eyes.
The prince picked up the bailer himself and gave it to the sailor.
- Are we still far from land?" he asked.
Raïden climbed onto a bench seat holding onto the mast and looked out over the waves.
- No master," he said, "we're making fast speed. In a few minutes we'll be there.
- And the other boats," said Loo, "you can't see them any more.
- I can see them," said Raïden. Some are very close to land, others are further away than we are.
- Where are we going to land?" asked the prince, "in enemy territory perhaps, because at the moment Japan looks like a chessboard; the white squares are in Fide-Yori, the red squares in Hiéyas.
- As long as we're not thrown onto any rocks, everything will be fine," says Nata, "the usurper won't worry about poor sailors like us.
- I'm not a sailor," said Loo, pointing to his sabre, "I'm a lord.
The sky darkened, a dull rumble rolled around the horizon.
- This is my boss speaking," said Raïden. Steer left, Nata," he added, "we're heading straight for a rocky bank. More! More! Careful, Prince! Hold on tight, Loo, this is it, this is the hardest part.
Indeed, the storm was raging and, close to the shore, the waves were leaping up and down with a sort of madness. They came in a furious gallop, their foamy crest driven forward; then they poured in like cataracts. Others would turn back, leaving a broad sheet of white foam on the sand.
The sail was lowered quickly; the mast was lowered: all we had to do was let the sea push us along. But it seemed impossible not to be torn to pieces by these formidable waves, which struck the boat with redoubled blows, breaking against it and leaping over it every now and then.
Fortunately, the bottom was fast approaching.
Raïden suddenly jumped into the waves. He had a foothold. He pushed the boat backwards with all his strength.
Nata also got out and pulled the boat by a chain. Soon its keel sank deep into the sand.
We hurried ashore.
- It's terrible, the sea!" said the Prince of Nagato when he reached the shore, "how it howls! how it sobs! What despair, what terror, makes her panic so? Does it not seem as if she is fleeing in pursuit of a formidable enemy? It's really a miracle that we managed to escape her!
- Unfortunately, you can't always escape her," says Raïden, "she devours a lot of sailors. How many of my companions have lain beneath its waves! I often think of them, in the storm, I think I hear them and I tell myself that it is with the voices of the shipwrecked that the sea laments and cries.
All the boats had reached the shore one after the other without serious accident; some were half broken, however, by the impact against the shore.
- Where are we?" said the prince, "let's try to find out.
The boats were pulled as far as possible out of the reach of the sea and we left the flat white beach that stretched as far as the eye could see.
Above the low cliff, formed by the accumulation of sand, we found a large, half-cultivated plain, which seemed to have been abandoned. A few huts stood out and we walked towards them.
We called out, but no one answered.
- The noise of the wind has deafened the inhabitants," said Loo.
He began banging his fists and feet against the doors.
The huts were empty.
- It seems that we are in the game of Hiéyas on the chessboard that you were talking about earlier," said Raïden, "the peasants are not fleeing from the troops of the siogoun.
- If we're close to the enemy, so much the better," said the prince, "since it's the enemy we've been looking for.
- How dark it is," exclaimed Loo, "it looks like night.
- It's the storm," said Nata, "these huts are the perfect place for us to take shelter.
Indeed, the rain soon began to fall in torrents, and the few trees scattered across the plain bent to the ground with all their branches driven to one side. Thunder rumbled.
The sailors invaded the deserted huts; they were tired, they lay down and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the prince, leaning against a doorframe, watched outside as the rain, as hard as the stalks of corn, dug into the ground; sometimes the wind broke it up and blew it away as dust.
In reality, Ivakoura didn't see what he was looking at; what he saw was Kioto's palace, the verandah amidst the flowers, the queen slowly descending the steps, searching for him with her eyes, half-smiling at him. He was beginning to feel the unbearable pain of this long separation. He told himself that perhaps
perhaps he would die without seeing her again.
Two men appeared on the plain. Battered by the storm, they hurried along the path.
Nagato instinctively hid in the doorway and watched the men.
They were dressed like peasants, but the wind, which blew their clothes haphazardly, showed that they were armed with swords.
They marched straight towards the huts.
The prince woke up Raïden and Nata and showed them these armed peasants who were still approaching, blinded by the rain.
- You see," he said, "in wartime, fishermen are not what they seem, and neither are the peasants.
- These people have replaced their spades with sabres," said Raïden. Are they our enemies or our allies?
- We'll find out," said Nagato, "because we're going to take them prisoner.
The two men came forward with their heads down to protect their faces from the rain; they thought the huts were deserted and ran towards them to find shelter.
- Come in and dry off," shouted Raïden when they were close, "the rain is bouncing off your skull like a waterfall off a rock.
Hearing this voice, the new arrivals leapt back and fled.
We soon caught up with them.
- What does this mean?" said Raïden, "why are you fleeing so quickly?
Do you have something to hide?
- You'll show us," said Nata with her good, silly laugh.
All the sailors were awake and gathered in the same hut.
The two men were brought before the prince. On their heads they wore hats like mushrooms that hid half their faces, and on their shoulders they wore coarse coats of unbraided straw that made them look like thatched roofs. They were dripping.
- Who are you?" asked Nagato.
They stared at the prince with a dumbfounded expression? one of them stammered something unintelligible.
- Speak more clearly," said Nagato. Who are you?
Then they both shouted together:
- Peasants.
Loo, sitting on the ground with his chin in his hand, looked at them. He burst out laughing.
- Peasants!" he said, "more like monkeys; your feigned naivety does a poor job of hiding your malice.
- Why did you try to flee?" said the prince.
- I was afraid," said one, stamping his feet and scratching his head.
- I was scared," repeated the other.
- You're not peasants," said the prince.
why are you hiding two sabres in your belt?
- It's because... there's war everywhere, it's good to be armed.
- There's war everywhere," repeated the other.
- Come on!" cried Raïden, "tell the truth; we're friends of Hiéyas; if you're one of us, you have nothing to fear.
One of the men gave Raïden a quick glance.
- Strip them of their weapons and search them," said the prince to the sailor.
- By all the Kamis, you have beautiful swords!" cried Raïden; "they must have cost you a lot of money. You must be rich peasants.
- We took them from dead soldiers.
- So you're thieves!" exclaimed Loo.
What's all this?" said the sailor, grabbing a piece of paper carefully hidden under the clothes of one of the strangers.
- Since we can't escape, we might as well admit the truth; we're messengers," said one of the men, losing his stupid look. This is a letter written by the general Hachisuka to Hiéyas.
- Very well," said Raiden, passing the letter to Nagato.
- If you really are servants of the same master as us," said the other messenger, "don't keep us any longer, let us carry out our mission.
- When the rain stops," said Loo.
The prince opened the small paper bag, sealed at one end with rice glue, and took out the letter. It read as follows:
"General Hachisuka rushes forehead to the ground before the illustrious and all-powerful Minamoto Hiéyas.
"Happy days are followed by unhappy ones, and it is a disaster that I am ashamed and pained to announce to you today. The subterranean affair, so well imagined by your great mind, has been carried out. With enormous effort, thousands of soldiers working night and day, came to the end of the work; we were sure of victory. But Marisiten, the genius of battles, was cruel to us. By some treachery, Yoké-Moura was warned, and I hardly dare tell you that five thousand heroes died on the narrow road we had dug, without the enemy losing a single man.
We have regained the position in the village that we had lost for a moment. So nothing is compromised yet, and I intend to announce to you soon a dazzling revenge.
"Written under the walls of Osaka, on the fifth day of the seventh moon, in the first year of the Fide-Tadda siogun".
- This is happy news, my friends," said the prince, who had read the letter aloud, "and I want to take it to Hiéyas myself. I'd be curious to enter his camp and slip into his tent.
- So you are not friends of Hiéyas, as you said? said one of the messengers.
- No, we're not his friends," said Nagato, "but what do you care, since I'm carrying the message for you?
- It's true, all in all, I don't mind, especially as bringing bad news is always poorly received.
- Where is the camp of Hiéyas?
- Half an hour from here.
- On which side?
- To the left, on the edge of the plain, in a wood.
- Is Hiéyas there in person?
- He's there now.
- Is there a password to enter the camp?
- There is," said the messenger hesitantly.
- Do you know it?
- Of course, but I mustn't say it.
- Then Hiéyas won't get the message.
- That's true, isn't it? Are you determined to keep us here?
- Absolutely," says Nagato, "and we won't harm you if you tell the truth, and we'll kill you if you deceive us.
- Well, the password is Mikava.
- The name of the province where Hiéyas is prince," said Nagato.
- Precisely. What's more, you have to show the sentries three chrysanthemum leaves engraved on an iron blade.
The speaker pulled a small iron plate from his belt and handed it to the prince.
- Is that all," asked Nagato, "you told the truth?
- I swear it. Besides, our lives are in your hands and will depend on our sincerity.
- So give us only your hats and straw cloaks.
The messengers obeyed, then went to lie down in a corner.
- You will accompany me, Raïden," said the prince.
The sailor, proud to have been chosen, swelled with pride.
- And me?" said Loo, pouting.
- You'll stay with Nata," said the prince. Later, perhaps tonight, I'll need you all.
Loo withdrew disappointed.
They waited until evening, and then the Prince and Raïden, disguised in their turn as peasants, headed for the camp of Hiéyas.
The sailors watched their leader leave with concern.
- May your venture succeed! they shouted at him.
- May Marisiten protect you!
The rain had stopped, but the wind was still blowing, passing over the fallen grass with a silky whistle; in the still-clear sky, thick clouds spun rapidly, covering and uncovering the thin crescent moon. At the end of the plain, the wood could be seen silhouetted against the horizon.
- Don't you have any instructions to give me, Master?" asked Raïden when they got close to the wood.
- Observe and remember what you have seen," said the prince, "I want to know if the enemy camp cannot be attacked from any point; in that case I will call Harounaga, who is still in Soumiossi, and we will try to beat Hiéyas. In any case, we'll try to surprise some of his plans.
The sentries had already signalled the arrivals. They shouted:
- Who's there?
- Messengers!" replied Raïden.
- Where are they from?
- From Osaka; General Hachisuka sent them.
- Do they know the password?
Mikava!" shouted the sailor.
A soldier approached with a lantern. Then the prince pulled from his belt the iron plate on which the chrysanthemum leaves were engraved.
- Come," said the soldier, "the master is impatiently waiting for you.
They entered the wood.
A few lanterns hung from the trees, sheltered from the wind by two shields, and they walked on straw that had been dragged out of the tents by the comings and goings.
From far and wide, a soldier holding a high spear, his quiver on his back, would appear standing motionless; behind the trees, under the half-open tents, other soldiers could be seen drinking or sleeping. Beyond, the gaze was lost in a deep darkness.
The tent of Hiéyas was set up in the centre of a clearing that had been carved out like a room and surrounded by a red drapery fixed to stakes; a large banner fluttered on the tent, tormented by the wind; two archers stood on either side of the opening made in the first wall of cloth.
The messengers were ushered in.
Hiéyas was seated on a folding chair. He seemed weighed down by age, slumped over, his head bowed on his chest, his lower lip hanging down, his eyes watery and weary. To see this attitude and this dazed expression, one could not believe in the powerful genius, the tenacious will locked up in this debilitated and ugly envelope. However, the spirit kept watch, lucid and ardent, exhausting the body, overwhelming it with fatigue and heroic contempt.
- Any news from Osaka? he said, quickly.
The letter was handed to him, which he hastily unfolded.
The wind penetrated to the tent, stirring the flames of the lanterns hanging from the central pole. The forest rustled violently and we could hear the sea crashing against the shores.
Hiéyas gave no indication of the feelings he was experiencing as he read General Hachisuka's letter. He beckoned to some of the chiefs in his tent to approach him, and handed them the letter.
Then he turned to the messengers.
- Did Hachisuka give you a verbal message in addition to this letter?
Raiden was about to answer when several men entered the tent.
- Master!" shouted a soldier, "here are other messengers arriving at the same time from different points.
- Good! good!" said Hiéyas, "let them come closer.
One of the newcomers came forward and knelt down. He was carrying something under his cloak.
- Illustrious lord," he said in a firm, triumphant voice, "I have come from the castle of Toza. I bring you, on behalf of my master, the head of the Prince of Nagato.
This time, Hiéyas could not conceal his emotion; his lips twitched and he held out his trembling hands with senile impatience.
Raïden jerked when he heard the messenger, but the prince gestured to him to be silent.
- I'm curious to see that face," murmured the sailor.
The man had uncovered a bag of plaited straw, closed at the end by a rope, and was untying it.
Hiéyas motioned for a lantern to be unhooked and brought close to him.
- Is it really true? is it really true?" he said, "I can't believe it.
The envoy pulled the head out of the bag; it was wrapped in a piece of red silk that seemed to have been dyed with blood.
The cloth was removed, and Hiéyas took the head in his hands and rested it on his knees. A man standing next to him was shining the lantern on it.
The head was so pale that it looked like marble; the deep black hair, knotted at the top of the skull, gleamed with flashes of blue, the eyebrows were slightly contracted, the eyes closed, a mocking smile tightened the discoloured lips.
- If the Prince wasn't standing right next to me, I'd swear this head had been cut off on his shoulders," thought a stunned Raïden.
Nagato, painfully moved, had grabbed the sailor's hand in a nervous movement.
- My poor Sado!" he murmured, "devoted unto death, as you said!
Hiéyas, his forehead bent, gazed hungrily at the head in his lap.
- It's him! it's him!" he said, "he's vanquished at last, he's dead, the one who insulted me so often and who always escaped my vengeance! Yes, there you are, motionless and frightening, you whom the women followed with sighing eyes, whom the men envied and tried to imitate. You are even paler than usual, and despite the scornful expression that your features still retain, you will no longer scorn anyone, your gaze will no longer clash with mine like a sword against a sword, you will no longer stand in my way. You were a noble heart and a great mind, I admit, but unfortunately you failed to understand how unselfish and useful to the country my plans were. You devoted yourself to a lost cause, and I had to break you.
- Truly!" murmured Raïden.
The messenger recounted how the prince had been captured and executed.
- They disarmed him!" cried Hiéyas, "they didn't allow him to kill himself.
- No, my lord, he was beheaded alive, and from the moment his head fell off he never stopped insulting his conqueror.
- Toza is a zealous servant," said Hiéyas with a hint of irony.
- He is a villain," murmured the Prince of Nagato, "and he will atone for his crime harshly. I will avenge you, brave Sado.
- How cold death is!" said Hiéyas, whose hands froze at the touch of the pale flesh, and who handed Sado's head to one of the chiefs standing next to him. Toza can ask me whatever he likes," he added, addressing the envoy, "I won't refuse him anything; but there was another messenger, what does he have to say?
The second messenger came forward and bowed.
- Your soldiers have taken Fusimi and are about to begin their attack on Kioto.
On hearing these words, the Prince of Nagato, who was still holding Raiden's hand, squeezed it with such force that Raiden almost screamed.
- Kioto's attack! What does that mean?" said the prince in fright.
- If it's like that," said Hiéyas, rubbing his hands together, "the war will soon be over. Once the Mikado is in our power, Osaka will fall of its own accord.
- We have to get out of here," said the prince in Raïden's ear.
- Hiéyas is just dismissing the messengers," said Raïden.
As the sheet closing the tent was lifted, a red glow lit up the wood.
- What is it?" asked Hiéyas.
Several chiefs came out of the tent and enquired. A great flame was rising on the seaward side; the wind was activating it and bringing the sound of crackling, fizzing wood.
- What could be burning on this beach?
- There's no village on this side.
Information was coming in.
It's boats," someone said.
- Our boats!" sighed Raïden, "well, that's nice!
- We don't know where they came from, but suddenly we saw them washed up on the beach.
- Are there many of them?
- About fifty of them. We walked towards them; they were deserted.
These large, well-equipped boats looked suspicious.
- We remembered Soumiossi.
- So we set fire to them. Now they're blazing merrily away.
- What a misfortune! What a misfortune!" said Raïden, "our beautiful boats! What are we going to do?
- Silence," said the prince; "let's try to get out of here.
- It may not be as easy as getting in.
They realised that they were free in the camp, no one was paying any attention to them, so they set off in search of a way out.
- They're attacking Kioto and I'm here!" said the prince in extraordinary agitation; "our flotilla is destroyed, I'd need two hundred horses; where can I get them?
- There's no shortage of them here," said Raïden, "but how can we get hold of them?
- We'll come back with our companions," said the prince, "look how these horses are tied.
- Simply by the bridle to the trunks of the trees.
- They are placed behind the tents in groups of five or six, as far as I can see in the dark?
- Yes, master.
- We'll have to take them.
- We'll do what you tell us," said Raïden, without objecting that it might be impossible.
They had arrived at the edge of the wood, at the point where they had entered the camp. The sentries were being relieved and the one who had brought them in recognised them.
- Are you leaving already?
- Yes," said Raïden, "we're taking orders with us.
- Bon voyage!" said the soldier.
And he motioned to the man replacing him to let them through.
- Well, we're almost out of here," said Raïden when they reached the plain.
The prince walked quickly. Soon they were back in the huts. All the sailors were on their feet and in despair.
They ran to meet the prince.
- Master! Master!" they cried, "our boats are burnt.
What will become of us?
- It was that infamous Hiéyas who did this," cried Loo; "but I will take revenge on him.
- Do you have your weapons?" asked Nagato.
- Of course we have our swords and guns.
- Well, now you must show me that your courage is worthy of the confidence I have in it. We have to do something heroic that may cost us our lives. We are going to penetrate the camp of Hiéyas, jump on his horses and flee towards Kioto. If we're not dead, we'll be in the sacred city before sunrise.
- Very well!" said Loo, "let's enter the camp of Hiéyas, I've got my idea.
- We're ready to follow you," said the sailors, "our lives are yours.
- The darkness will hide us from the eyes of our enemies, and the sound of the wind stirring the leaves will prevent the sound of our footsteps from being heard. Maybe we'll get through. The only thing that worries me is that we won't have time to steal the head of the brave servant who died for me, so that we can bury him with the respect he deserves.
- What head?" Loo asked Raïden quietly.
- I'll tell you what I know," whispered the sailor.
- Let's split up," said the prince, "one by one we have a better chance of going unnoticed; if we have to meet again, it will be on the other side of the wood. May the Kamis protect us!
The sailors dispersed. The darkness was deep and they suddenly disappeared.
Loo stayed by Raïden's side, questioning him about everything he had seen in the camp. When he'd had enough, the child escaped and ran ahead.
He had a plan, two in fact, since he knew about the adventure with the severed head: he wanted to steal the head and then take revenge for the burning of the boats. For him, entering the camp without being seen was just a game: he had the silent walk of a cat; he knew how to leap, slide and lie flat on his stomach without stirring a blade of grass; he wouldn't have aroused a watchdog.
The lights of the camp guided him; he ran straight towards the edge of the wood; he wanted to be the first to enter.
He almost reached the sentry without seeing her; he threw himself flat on his stomach: she didn't see him.
- I've got it," he said, slipping into a thicket; "the hardest part is over.
The wind was still blowing and great flashes of blue filled the night from time to time.
- Ah god of storms!" said Loo as he ran on all fours under your leaves, "you're behaving badly; bang your gongs as much as you like, but turn off your lantern. As for you, Futen, genius of the wind, blow! blow! even harder!
With the exception of the sentries, the whole camp was asleep; in the intermittent wind, one could hear regular breathing and a few snores. Loo was heading, according to Raïden's indications, towards Hiéyas's tent. He reached it and recognised the red draperies that formed a wall around the tent. Two archers stood in front of the entrance. Lanterns hung from poles above them, and they leaned against the poles with their backs.
- Yes! yes! look out to sea for the last glimmers of our burning boats," said Loo, "that will prevent you from seeing me go by.
He crawled under the drapery, flattening himself against the ground; but to reach the tent, he still had a fairly wide, bare and lit space to cross.
He hesitated for a moment and glanced at the archers.
They have their backs to me," he said, "I think they're sleeping standing up.
He stood up and, in three leaps, reached the edge of the canvas; then he sank underneath.
A blue lantern lit up the inside of the tent. Hiéyas, lying on a silk mattress, his upper body supported by a large number of cushions, was sleeping soundly; sweat was beading on his forehead and he was breathing heavily.
Loo looked up at the former regent and made a face at him, then looked around the tent.
On a mat, not far from the master, a servant was sleeping.
A writing case and a few rare porcelain cups lay on a very low, black wooden stepladder; in one corner, a complete suit of armour, collapsed in on itself, gave the impression of a man cut into pieces. A large red lacquer chest, on which the three chrysanthemum leaves, the insignia of Hiéyas, protruded in gold, caught the light and gleamed.
The straw bag containing Sado's head was leaning against the chest. Hiéyas had wanted to keep it so that he could show it to all his soldiers the next day.
Loo guessed that the severed head must be locked in this bag; he crawled over to it and opened it; but at that moment Hiéyas woke up. He gave several groans of pain, wiped his forehead and took a few sips of a drink prepared for him.
The child had hidden behind the chest and was holding his breath. Soon the old man fell back onto the cushions and dozed off again.
Loo then pulled his head out of the bag and carried him away.
No sooner had he left the tent than cries of alarm rang out from all sides. The trampling of horses and the clash of weapons could be heard over the constant rustling of the trees in the wind.
Hiéyas woke a second time and stood up, breathless from the start. He pulled aside the sheet that closed the tent.
A flash of lightning dazzled him, then he saw nothing but deep darkness. But soon, in the light of a new flash, longer and brighter than the first, he saw, with horrible surprise, the man he had thought dead, the man whose lifeless head he had held in his hands a few moments before, the Prince of Nagato, sword in hand, riding a horse that seemed to Hieyas to make no sound.
His weakened nerves, his mind overexcited by fever and still numb from sleep, did not allow him to react against a superstitious fear; his fortitude deserted him; he let out a frightening cry:
- A ghost! a ghost!" he cried, spreading fear throughout the entire camp.
the whole camp. Then he fell roughly to the ground unconscious.
They thought he was dead.
Some of the chiefs also recognised the Prince of Nagato and, no less frightened than Hiéyas, completed the confusion in the army.
The cry "A ghost!" went from mouth to mouth. The soldiers, who had left at the sound of the alarm, rushed back to their tents.
Someone heroic had the idea of approaching the bag to see if the severed head was still there. When he saw that it had disappeared, this unbeliever began to shout out the news; confusion was at its height; all these men, so brave in the face of real danger, shuddered in the face of the supernatural; they threw themselves flat on their stomachs, loudly invoking the Kamis or Buddha, according to their beliefs.
The Prince of Nagato and his men were very surprised by the welcome they received, but they took advantage of it and crossed the wood without being bothered.
When they reached the other side of the forest, they waited for each other, then counted each other; not one was missing, they were all on horseback.
- The kamis are really protecting us," said the sailors; "who would have thought that the adventure would end like this?
- And that we would be taken for ghosts!
We were about to set off.
- And Loo!" suddenly exclaimed Raïden, "where is he?
- It's true," said the prince, "he's the only one who hasn't returned.
- He was the first to leave," said Raïden. They waited a few moments.
- Unfortunately," said the prince, "the duty that calls me does not allow any delay, we must leave; it is with sorrow that I abandon this devoted child.
Abandoning Loo! the joy of all, the one who reminded fathers of their children, this little mocking hero, a little cruel, who feared nothing and laughed at everything! We set off, all sighing with heavy hearts.
- Perhaps he got lost in the darkness," said Raïden, turning round frequently.
We had been walking for ten minutes when those behind us thought they heard a hurried gallop. They stopped and listened. A horse was indeed coming; the sound of footsteps was soon mingled with bursts of laughter: it was Loo.
- Raïden shouted, come and pick me up, I'm going to fall, I can't take it any more, I've laughed too much!
Raïden hurried to meet the child.
- Well, here you are," he said, "why did you stay behind?
You scared us.
- It's because I had a lot of things to do," said Loo; "you finished before me.
- What did you do?
- Take this for me first," said Loo, handing Raïden the severed head; it's as heavy as if it were made of stone.
- How did you manage to steal it?
- Yes," said Loo, who kept looking behind him, "and they think it's gone off on its own, so they're all mad at the moment.
We set off again at full gallop to join the prince and those who had accompanied him.
- Has the child returned?" asked Nagato.
- Yes, Master, and he's brought the head of the man who looked like you," exclaimed Raiden with a sort of paternal pride.
- That's not all I did," said Loo, who was still looking back. "Look at those pink lights over there, doesn't it look like the sun is coming up?
- Indeed, the sky is lit up," said the prince, "it looks like the reflection of a fire.
That's just it," said Loo, clapping his hands, "the forest is burning.
- You've started the fire!" cried Raïden.
- Didn't I swear that I would avenge our beautiful boats that are lying on the beach, reduced to ashes?
- How did you do it? Tell us about it," said the sailor.
- Ah!" exclaimed Loo, "I'll tell you: as soon as I stole the head of the victim, I heard cries from all sides. So I looked for a horse to be ready to flee. However, I had no idea of leaving yet. When I was on the mount of my choice, I broke off a resinous branch and lit it on a lantern, which I unhooked and then threw into the straw of the bedding. This straw caught fire immediately, and the wind blowing on my torch activated it. I moved away, setting fire to everything. To my great surprise, the soldiers, instead of jumping on me and wringing my neck, threw themselves on their knees when they saw me, stretched out their hands towards me and begged me to spare them; some took me for Tatsi-Maki, the dragon of the Typhoons, others for Marisiten, and they thought they saw in my horse the boar on which the god of battles stands.
I was writhing with laughter, and the more I laughed, the more frightened they became; so I rode through the forest, taking my ease, lighting a banner here, a dead tree there or a bundle of fodder.
- I would never have believed that an army of brave men could be so terrified by a child!" cried Raïden, laughing heartily.
- If you had seen them," said Loo, "how they mumbled, how they trembled. And there was good reason for it: people were saying on all sides that a ghost had stretched out his sword-wielding arm towards Hiéyas, who had immediately fallen to his death.
- Yes," said Nata, "we've been mistaken for a legion of ghosts.
The glow of the burning forest filled the sky to the zenith. The prince turned his head and looked.
- Loo," he said, "I have to praise myself every day for taking you with me; you have the fearlessness of a hero and, beneath your frail exterior, the heart of a lion. The two deeds you have just accomplished deserve a resounding reward: I give you the title of samurai.
On hearing this, Loo was speechless with emotion. He looked at Raïden, who was riding beside him, and then suddenly threw himself into his arms.
On the Prince's orders, some of the men dismounted and, with the tips of their sabres, dug a grave by the side of the road to bury the head of the heroic Sado.
- We'll come and take it back later to give it the honours it deserves," said the prince.
When the grave was closed, stones were heaped on top of it to find it.
- Now," said the prince, "let's make haste; we must be in Kioto before dawn.
The horses were put into a gallop. A few men went ahead, scouting.
The prince also went ahead of the rest of his troop. He wanted to be alone, to hide his emotion and anxiety. He had not been dreaming; the messenger had indeed told Hiéyas that the attack on Kioto was about to begin. Attacking the sacred capital of the Mikados!
to lay hands on the divine person of the Son of the Gods!
Nagato could not believe such a sacrilege; what's more, the idea that the Kisaki was in danger upset him. The thought of her sovereign power being insulted by one of her subjects, frightened by war cries and the sound of battle, perhaps forced to flee, sent him into a frenzy of rage. He was astonished that he hadn't jumped at Hiéyas' throat and strangled him with his hands the moment he'd mentioned Kioto.
- I had pity and respect for his old age, he said to himself, does such a man deserve pity?
However, in the midst of these thoughts of anger and worry, he could not help feeling a deep sense of joy. To be closer to her, to see her again, to hear again that voice his ears were so eager to hear! Was it possible? His heart swelled in his chest, a smile parted his lips, all he could see was her.
- It's fate," he said to himself, "it's prevented me from leaving Kioto; a premonition warned me that she would need me.
What did he intend to do to defend the sacred city against what were undoubtedly considerable forces? He couldn't say.
However, he had no doubt that he would triumph over his adversaries, whoever they might be. There are sovereign wills that tame events, that, in battle, drive the combatants, exalt their courage and make them formidable.
The Prince of Nagato felt within himself one of these irresistible wills. To save her, it seemed to him that he alone would have scattered an army.
XXI
THE KISAKI
Kioto was only five leagues from the camp of Hiéyas, but the Prince of Nagato made a diversion so as not to enter the town from the Fusimi side, occupied by the victors; they reached the banks of Lake Biva and rode along them.
Daylight was beginning to break. It was still dark all over the land, but the sky and water were whitening; a fine mist hung here and there.
The lake is shaped like a musical instrument called a biva; it stretches behind the mountains that surround Kioto and separate it from the town.
circle, enters Kioto from the south.
By order of General Sanada-Sayemon-Yoké-Moura, General Yama-Kava was to camp with his five thousand men on the edge of the lake at the foot of the mountains, but as he advanced, the Prince of Nagato became certain that Yama-Kava had abandoned the position.
Kava had abandoned the position. He found traces of the camp, the ashes of extinguished fires, the holes dug by the tent poles.
- What does this portend?" he said to himself, "If the general has left his post, it must be that danger has called him elsewhere; perhaps the battle has begun, perhaps it's all over, and I'll be too late!
At this thought, the prince, seized by a terrible anguish, threw his horse towards the mountain and pushed it up a rough and inaccessible path. If he succeeded in climbing the hill, he would reach Kioto in a few moments, instead of having to spend several hours making the long diversions along the banks of the lake and the river.
Loo was the first to set off behind his master; all the sailors soon followed, after calling back the vanguard.
The crest of the hill was reached with great difficulty; it was joined by a shallow curve to another higher peak: this was the mountain of Udji, on which the most delicate tea is harvested.
The Western Orchard, where the poetic struggle presided over by the Kisaki had taken place, was located on this mountain. The prince found this enclosure in front of him, so he took his horse through the palisade and crossed the orchard.
The trees were laden with fruit, the heavy branches bending down to the turf.
The prince stopped at the edge of the terrace overlooking the city, just where a few months earlier the queen had approached him and spoken with tears in her eyes.
He glanced quickly at Kioto.
Black smoke was rising from various points. It was also visible in the dairi's compound. The palace and the town had been set on fire. The fortress of Nisio-Nosiro, on the Wild Goose River
River, was under siege; the horsemen of heaven were no doubt defending it. The Mikado must have taken refuge behind its ramparts. Further on, on the other side of the town, a battle was being waged between Yama-Kava's men and the soldiers of Hiéyas. The latter were more or less masters of Kioto. Yama-
Kava still held the eastern part of the town, but the Hieyas banner flew at all other points.
The Prince of Nagato, his eyebrows contracted, stared at the scene unfolding at his feet; he bit his lips to the quick, full of anger, but retained his lucidity of mind and coolly examined the situation.
When a battle takes place in a city, the combatants are inevitably scattered: the design of the streets and their narrow width force them to divide up. Each street and crossroads has its own special, isolated battle, ignoring the phases of neighbouring battles.
The Prince of Nagato immediately understood the advantage offered by this arrangement of the battle. His small troop, nowhere to be found on the plain where its small size would have been exposed, could, with an impetuous dash, produce a happy effect by surprising the enemy from behind, perhaps throwing confusion into his ranks.
The prince made up his mind quickly, shouting to rally his men who, with great difficulty, had managed to join him, then he threw his horse onto the other side of the high hill and shouted:
- Follow me.
The descent was most perilous, but the energy of the men seemed to be communicated to the horses: they reached the bottom of the slope without accident, then rushed, with formidable impetuosity, into the street most crowded with soldiers.
The noise produced by this precipitous gallop on the flagstones was enormous. The soldiers turned round and saw the street full of horsemen and, with that instinctive fear that men on foot feel when faced with men on horseback, they wanted to pull over. To do so, they jostled and tumbled over each other, trying to invade the side streets. The horsemen fired a few shots, which made it even quicker for the pedestrians to flee. In an instant the street was emptied, and the fugitives went to cause alarm in the neighbouring districts.
It was as if they were caught between two armies.
The street Nagato had entered was very long, crossing almost the entire city, and ended in a small square.
On the other side of the square, the roads leading to it were occupied by Yama-Kava soldiers; in the square itself, the opponents had joined forces.
The battle had only just begun. Despite being outnumbered, Fidé-Yori's supporters were not backing down.
At the entrance to the square, the prince stopped; he was master of the street and he had to hold it.
- Twenty men should go and defend the other end of this street," he shouted, "and two men should stand in front of each alleyway that opens onto it; now the soldiers of Yama-Kava should be told that they must try to join us.
Raïden dashed across the square, a hail of arrows enveloped him, his horse fell, the sailor got up, he was wounded, but he was able to reach the other side of the crossroads.
A burst of musket fire brought down many men. An empty space formed in front of the street occupied by the prince, the enemy soldiers gathered around their leaders, they consulted each other; they were of the opinion that they should withdraw into the neighbouring streets and abandon the square.
They made this move, which was almost a retreat.
From then on, nothing was easier for the men of Yama-
Kava's men than to join forces with Nagato's men. The former crossed the square at a run and entered the conquered street. Soon their generator himself appeared, on horseback, masked, armoured in black horn, spear in hand.
- It's the lord of Nagato!" he exclaimed, recognising the prince. I am no longer surprised to have seen the enemies so rudely repulsed. Victory seems to be your captive.
- If it is true that I have chained her, may she never regain her freedom! said the prince. So what's going on here?
he added. What sacrilege, what unprecedented crime, are we witnessing?
- It is indeed incredible," said the general. Hiéyas wants to kidnap the mikado and burn down the city.
- And for what purpose?
- I don't know.
- I think I can guess," said the prince; "once the mikado was in his hands, he would have forced him to proclaim him siogoun, the whole people would have declared for Hiéyas and Fidé-Yori would have been forced to lay down his arms.
- This man has all the audacity!
- Where is the mikado at the moment?" asked the prince.
- In the fortress of Nisio-Nosiro.
- I thought so, and I think I met you in the battle plan.
- It would be an honour for me," said the general.
- I think your army is going to spread out along this street, like a lake that becomes a river, and envelop the enemy. In this way it will separate them from the banks of the Kamon-Gava, and isolate the attackers, who are fairly few in number, it seems to me, from the fortress.
It's towards the fortress that you should retreat, to take shelter behind its walls.
- This was indeed my plan," said the general, "but without your help I would probably not have been able to break through the enemy ranks.
- Well then, now lead your men towards the fortress, while I hold our opponents here for as long as possible.
The general left.
The soldiers of Hiéyas returned; the initial panic had subsided; through all the left-hand alleys, they attacked the street separating them from the river; they were met with rifle shots and volleys of arrows; they retreated, then came back.
- We have to barricade these alleys," said the prince.
- With what?
The hermetically sealed houses seemed dead, their mere appearance, mute and blind, made it clear that to strike would be useless and would awaken no echo in the souls of the terrified inhabitants.
The shutters were torn down, the windows collapsed, the houses were invaded, a sort of looting began, and everything was thrown out: screens, bronze vases, lacquerware, mattresses, lanterns. With astonishing speed, all this accumulated in a jumble at the entrances to the alleyways. A tea merchant was completely robbed, and all the exquisite varieties of the aromatic leaf, wrapped in silk paper, in lead boxes or in precious chests, lay on the ground, open to arrows and bullets: the air was perfumed.
The enemy pressed on, but could not cross the street.
Towards the river, the sound of another battle could be heard.
The prince sent one of his men to that side.
- As soon as Yama-Kava has triumphed, come and tell us.
The battle was becoming terrible: some barricades had been broken through and people were fighting hand to hand in the street, which was full of dust and smoke.
- Courage! courage!" shouted Nagato to his men; "just a moment more!
At last the envoy returned.
- Victory!" he shouted, "Yama-Kava has crossed the river.
Then Nagato's men began to fall back.
Yama-Kava, protected by the horsemen of the sky, who from the top of the towers were showering arrows on the attackers, had entered the fortress with his five thousand men. The mikado was now out of danger: seven thousand men behind the ramparts were worth the enemy general's ten thousand men in the open. The enemy general-
This one, full of anger, badly obeyed, understanding the mistake he had made by engaging his soldiers in the tangle of streets, rushed at the head of his men to raise their courage, force this passage so well defended and reach the banks of the Kamon-Gava.
He found the Prince of Nagato in front of him, both on horseback. They looked at each other for a moment.
- So it is you," cried the prince, "who are the instrument of this crime, so odious as to be unbelievable; it is you who would have the audacity to lay hands on the divine mikado!
In response, the general shot an arrow at Nagato that grazed his sleeve. The prince retaliated with a rifle shot from almost point-blank range. The warrior fell, never to rise again, onto the neck of his horse, without uttering a single cry.
News of his death spread quickly; the soldiers, left without a leader, hesitated.
- It was said that his sacrilegious audacity had brought him misfortune, and that it might well bring misfortune to us too.
The prince, who noticed this hesitation and the confused remorse that was rising in the soldiers' souls, came up with a plan that would make the victory decisive if it produced the effect he was expecting.
He ran to the banks of the Wild Goose River and shouted to the soldiers guarding the fortress:
- Make the mikado appear at the top of the tower.
His thoughts were understood, and they hurried to fetch Go-Mitsou-No.
Mitsou-No and brought him almost by force, more dead than alive, to the highest tower of the castle.
The Sun Goddess seemed to cast all her rays on this divine man whose equal she was; the mikado's red robes shone, the high golden blade of his crown sparkled on his forehead.
- The Son of the gods! The Son of the gods!
The soldiers raised their heads: they saw this dazzling display of purple and gold at the top of the tower, the man they were not supposed to see, the one who was surrounded by a frightening prestige and whom they had just outraged; they believed that the Mikado was about to take flight and leave the earth to punish it for the wickedness of men.
They threw down their weapons and rushed to their knees.
- Grace!" they cried, "don't leave us; what would become of us without you?
what would become of us without you?
- Sublime Lord! Almighty Master! We are wretched, but your goodness is infinite!
- We drag ourselves through the dust, flooding it with our tears of repentance!
Then they recriminated against their leaders.
- They pushed us, they trained us!
- They made us drunk on sake to make us lose our minds.
- The general paid for his crime with his life.
- Damn him!
- May he be carried off by the foxes!
- May the great judge of hell be inexorable to him!
The mikado looked around the city; he saw it full of smoke on all sides. He stretched out his arm and pointed to the burnt spots.
The soldiers below thought they saw an order in this gesture; they stood up and rushed to put out the fires they had started.
The victory was complete. The Prince of Nagato smiled as he saw how the effect produced by the appearance of the Mikado had lived up to his expectations.
But suddenly, just as he was about to set foot on the drawbridge and enter the fortress, panicked servants rushed to the banks of the Kamon-Gava.
- The queen," they shouted, "we're kidnapping the queen!
- What are you saying?" cried the prince, blushing, "the queen is not in the fortress?
- She hasn't had time to take refuge there, she's at the summer residence.
Without listening further, Nagato rushed like a flock in the direction of the palace, followed by what was left of his sailors, about fifty able-bodied men.
But these men lost sight of the prince, they didn't know the way, they got lost.
Nagato soon reached the gate of the summer palace. Some pages were standing on the threshold.
- This way! This way! they shouted to the prince, pointing out the road at the foot of the mountains.
Nagato took this road, lined with tall trees; it undulated in curves; there was little distance before his eyes; he saw nothing. He bloodied the flanks of his horse; it leapt. He threw down his rifle to lighten his load.
After ten minutes of mad running, he caught sight of the rump of a horse in a cloud of dust; the prince was gaining ground; he soon saw a veil floating and a man turning his head uneasily.
- Who is this man who has dared to take her in his arms?" said Nagato to himself, gnashing his teeth.
The kidnapper threw himself into a valley, and the prince soon joined him. Seeing himself lost, the man slid off his horse and fled on foot, abandoning the queen.
The prince thought he recognised the man fleeing as Faxibo, the former groom who had become Hiéyas' confidant.
It was indeed Faxibo. This man, who respected nothing, seeing the battle lost and the mikado out of reach, remembered Kisaki, isolated and defenceless in the summer palace; he understood the value of such a capture and resolved to kidnap the sovereign. He entered the palace pretending to be an envoy from Yama-Kava. He was on horseback when the queen rode out onto the verandah, so he seized her and fled from the palace before the servants had recovered from their surprise.
The prince had no time to pursue Faxibo, as the horse carrying the queen continued to run.
Nagato rushed towards her and took her in his arms - she had fainted.
He carried her to the shade of a tea bush and laid her on the grass, then dropped to one knee, trembling with emotion, distraught, mad. The dizziness of the run he had just made, the fatigue of the battle and of the sleepless night clouded his mind; he imagined he was dreaming; he looked at the woman who relentlessly filled his thoughts, and blessed the illusion that made him believe she was right in front of him.
Lying there in an abandoned, supple pose, very pale, her head turned back, her body wrapped in the fine folds of her lilac crepe dress, which the rapid beating of her heart lifted, she seemed to be asleep. Her sleeve had been raised a little, revealing her arm; her little hand resting on the grass, palm up, looked like a water lily flower.
- What sovereign beauty! the prince thought ecstatically; surely the Sun Goddess is no more resplendent! It seems as if a light shines through the whiteness of her skin, her mouth is reddened by the blood of a flower, her large eyes under their long black lashes look like two swallows drowned in milk. Don't fade away, celestial vision, stay always like this, my gaze riveted on you!
Gradually he regained a sense of reality, and realised that she was suffering and that he had forgotten to help her.
But what could he do? He looked around for a stream or a waterfall, but saw nothing. So he unfurled his fan and waved it gently over the queen's face.
She remained motionless.
The prince took her hand, thinking that perhaps she was cold; but he got up quickly and stepped back a few paces, frightened by the deep confusion caused by the touch of that soft, warm hand. He called out. No one answered. Those who, like him, were pursuing the queen's kidnapper, had continued straight ahead instead of entering the valley.
Nagato returned to the Kisaki; it seemed to him that she had moved; he knelt down again and gazed at her.
She opened her eyes, then closed them again as if dazzled by the light. The prince bent over her.
- Beloved Queen," he whispered, "come back to yourself!
She opened her eyes a second time and saw the prince. Then a lovely smile parted her lips.
A bird was singing above them.
- It's you, Ivakoura," she said in a faint voice, "you are with me at last! You can see that death is merciful and that it has reunited us!
- Alas!" said the prince, "we are still alive.
The Kisaki stood up and leaned on one hand. She looked around her, trying to remember, then looked back at Nagato.
- Didn't a man snatch me from my palace and carry me off?
- A wretch was indeed guilty of a crime worthy of a thousand deaths.
- What did he want with me?
- He wanted to take you prisoner so that he could impose conditions on the Mikado.
- The infamous man!" exclaimed the queen. I can guess the rest," she added.
You pursued my kidnapper and saved me. That doesn't surprise me. When I was in danger, I called on you! Just now, when I lost consciousness, I thought of you. I was calling out to you.
After saying these words, the Kisaki lowered her eyes and turned her head away, as if ashamed of such a confession.
- Oh, I implore you," cried the prince, "do not retract your words, do not repent of having spoken them, leave this divine dew to a plant scorched by an implacable sun.
The Kisaki raised her big eyes to the prince and looked at him for a long time.
- I do not repent," she said, "I love you, and I confess it proudly. My love is as pure as the light of a star, and there is no reason to hide it. I thought a lot while you were away: I was frightened by the feeling that was penetrating me more and more, I thought I was a criminal, I wanted to tame my heart, to silence my thoughts, but what was the point? Can a flower refuse to be born and bloom, can a star refuse to shine, can the night rebel when the day invades it as you have invaded my soul?
- Have I heard you right! It is to me that such words come from such a mouth," cried the prince, "you love me! you, Daughter of the Gods! Let me take you then; let us flee from the kingdom to a far-off land that will be paradise. You are mine because you love me. I have been so unhappy! Now happiness overwhelms me. Come, let us make haste; life is short to lock up such love.
- Prince," said the queen, "the confession I have just made to you, being what I am, should show you the extent to which my love is free from earthly concerns. I do not belong to this world, I am a wife, I am a sovereign, and no sinful action will be committed by me. My soul, without my will, has given itself to you; could I hide it from you? But if I have spoken today, it is because we must not meet again in this world.
- Never to see you again!" exclaimed the prince in horror. Why do you say such a cruel thing? Why, after opening up heaven before my eyes for a moment, do you suddenly throw me into the tortures of hell? Being deprived of your presence will kill me as surely as being deprived of air and light.
Nagato covered his face to hide the tears he couldn't hold back, but the queen gently removed his hands.
- Don't cry," she said. What is life? Little compared to eternity. I'm sure we'll meet again.
- But what if death were to be disappointing," said the prince, "what if life were to end in nothingness, what if everything were over after the last breath?
- That's impossible," she said, smiling, "because my love is infinite.
- Very well," said the prince, "I will kill myself.
- Swear to me you will do nothing of the sort," cried the Kisaki. What do we know
the will of heaven? Perhaps we don't have the right to escape our destiny, and if we don't accept it, we are obliged to return to earth.
- But that's impossible, I can't bear life," said the prince. Don't you understand what I'm suffering? You say you love me and you torture me like this!
- Do you think I don't suffer? I swear to you that I will die of this love without resorting to suicide.
The Prince had thrown himself on the ground, his face in the grass; great sobs were shaking him.
- You make me despair, Ivakoura," cried the queen, "all my fortitude is shattered by your pain. I am only a woman in front of you; my will is no longer sovereign: what must I do to dry your tears?
- Allow me to see you from time to time as I used to," said the prince; "only then will I be able to let death come.
- See each other again after what I have told you.
- I will forget if I must, divine friend; I will remain your humble and submissive subject. Never a look, never a word will betray the pride with which my soul is full.
The queen smiled as she saw happiness once again light up the prince's still moist eyes.
- You have defeated me", she said, "I thought my resolution was irrevocable; may I not be punished for my weakness!
- Punished! Why?" said the prince, "What harm are we doing?
Are not all the lords of the court admitted to your presence? I alone, because I am blind to anything that is not your beauty, would have been exiled. Wasn't that unfair?
- It was wise and prudent," said the queen, who sighed, "but I've given in, so let's not talk about it any more. Let's go back to the palace," she added.
Let's go and let the people know that I've been saved.
- Oh, stay a moment longer," murmured the prince, "we'll never find ourselves like this, in the middle of nature, alone, far from any eyes. It took civil war, crime and sacrilege to bring this about. Tomorrow all the pomp of your rank will envelop you again, and I will only be able to speak to you from afar.
- Who knows what will happen next?" said the queen, "the Mikado took refuge in the fortress, which was immediately surrounded by soldiers, and I was forced to stay in the summer palace.
- But since then they have been completely defeated," said the prince; "the enemy general has been killed and the army has surrendered; the Mikado is free. But let's not talk about that. Who cares about the war! Tell me, how long have you loved me?
- As long as I've known you," said the Kisaki, lowering her eyes.
I didn't suspect anything, when one day jealousy revealed my love for you.
- You, jealous?
- Yes, and madly so; I felt a strange, continuous pain, I couldn't sleep any more, pleasures irritated me, anger swept me away at every moment and I bullied my wives; the one I thought was in love with you, I hated; one evening, I chased her out of my presence because, on seeing you, she had betrayed her love with a scream. I was passing by on my way back to the palace; you were leaning against a tree in my path, and I can still see you, lit by the moon, pale with your burning eyes.
- Didn't you see that they were only looking at you?
- No, and all night long I wept silently.
- Oh, don't drive me mad!" cried the prince.
- You see," she said, "I'm not hiding anything from you, I'm laying my heart bare before you, trusting in your loyalty.
- I am worthy of that trust," said the prince, "my love is as pure as yours.
- A few days later," continued the queen, "you were kneeling before me in the audience hall. Surprised by your confusion, I let myself talk to you about my maid of honour. You cried out that you didn't love her, looking at me with a look that revealed your whole soul. Do you remember how angry and contemptuous I looked? If you only knew the ineffable joy that flooded through me: the gazelle that a tiger clutches between its claws and then suddenly abandons must feel a sensation similar to the one I was experiencing. I realised then that it was me you loved, your look and your emotion had told me so. When I left you, I ran into the gardens and wrote the quatrain that I gave you so lightly.
- It's there on my heart," said the prince, "it never leaves me.
- Do you recognise this?" said the Kisaki, showing the prince a fan tucked into the silver cloth belt that held her dress.
- No," said Nagato, "what is it?
She took the fan and unfolded it.
It was made of white paper powdered with gold; in one corner was a clump of reeds and two storks taking flight; in the other corner were four verses in Chinese characters.
The thing that you love more than anything else," said the queen, reading the verses, "that you love better than anyone else could love it, belongs to someone else; - so the willow that takes root in your garden - bends down, pushed by the wind, and embellishes the neighbouring enclosure with its branches.
- These are the verses I wrote in the Western Orchard!
exclaimed the prince. Have you kept this fan?
- I never wear another one," said the Kisaki.
They both laughed, forgetting their past suffering, enjoying with delight this minute of happiness. She was no longer talking about returning to the palace.
- If you were my brother!" she suddenly exclaimed, "if I could spend my life with you without being slandered, how delightfully the days would pass!
- And you, cruel woman, wanted to banish me from your presence!
- The Queen had ordered it; faced with your tears, the woman could not obey her! But, in your turn, tell me, how did you love me?
- I've loved you for a long time," said the prince; "my love was born long before you even saw me. When my father abdicated in my favour, I came to make my submission to the Mikado. Just as I was leaving the audience, you walked past me on a gallery. I thought I saw Ten-Sio-Daï-Tsin herself, and I was speechless with surprise and admiration. Your eyes were downcast; your long eyelashes cast a shadow across your cheeks. I can still see you when I close my eyes. A white peacock was embroidered on your dress; lotuses adorned your hair; your hand was absent-mindedly waving a fan made of pheasant feathers. It was only a flash: you disappeared, but from then on you were my whole life... I didn't return to the palace until a year later.
- That was when I saw you for the first time," said the queen.
Everyone was talking about you: my wives were not at a loss for words; your eulogy was on everyone's lips. I was curious to see this hero, to whom all virtues were attributed and who was said to have every grace. Hidden behind a blind, I watched you as you crossed the great courtyard of the dairi. I found that the praise was less than the truth, and I went away greatly disturbed.
- For a year I had waited impatiently for the moment when I hoped to see you again, and that year of waiting ended in disappointment. I couldn't help coming back a few days later; this time I was admitted to a party, which you attended. It was at this party that I realised Fatkoura's interest in me and that I formed the guilty plan of hiding the invincible passion that subjugated me behind a feigned love.
- How she must suffer, the unfortunate woman, to love and not be loved!" said the Kisaki, "I pity her with all my heart. Where is she
is she at the moment?
- In my castle at Hagui, near my father; I sent a messenger to him, so that he could bring me accurate news of the events that have taken place. My father must think I'm dead, because as you probably don't know, my kingdom has been ransacked, my fortress taken and my head chopped off; but never mind all that, I'd give my kingdom and the whole world just to see that lovely hollow that forms at the corner of your lips when you smile.
- Ah," said the Queen, "I too would happily give my diadem and all the splendours that surround me, to be your wife and live close to you; but let us not think of what is impossible," she added, "let us remember that our hope goes beyond the limits of this world.
As she said this, she raised her eyes to heaven.
- See, my friend!" she cried, "these clouds illuminated by bloody reflections, the sun is already setting, is it possible?
- Alas!" said the prince, "we must return to mankind.
- Don't be too sad," she murmured, "for we shall meet again.
The prince got up and looked for his horses. The one he had been riding had fallen exhausted and was dying. The other, very tired, had stopped a few paces away. With a deep sigh, he took the horse by the bridle and began to guide it over the grass.
As the Kisaki and the prince rode away, the bush that had sheltered them shook, and a man who had been hiding there fled.
XXII
THE MIKADO
Kioto thus escaped the danger she had run; the battle was over, the fires were extinguished. The Queen, who had been carried off by criminal hands at a time when the town was in confusion and terror, was brought back by the Prince of Nagato, through a people drunk with joy. The houses, so tightly closed just a few hours before, were wide open; everyone went out into the streets; the inhabitants chatted with the soldiers; sake barrels were rolled outside, collapsed, sung and danced. People thought they were dead, but now they were alive. There was much to be joyful about: cries went up from a street or a square; they bounced from mouth to mouth and soon the whole town was repeating them:
- Glory to the Mikado!
- Death to Hiéyas!
- A curse on his race!
- Blessings to General Yama-Kava!
- Praise to the horsemen of heaven!
- And glory to the Prince of Nagato, to whom we owe our victory!
- And who brings us back our divine Kisaki," said another.
The prince did indeed step forward, guiding the horse carrying the queen. The crowd moved aside, bowing before her in sudden silence, which ceased abruptly as soon as she had passed.
The queen had pulled her veil over her face and was clutching its folds to her chest with one hand; the horse, covered in foam, was whistling as it went. Nagato held it by the bridle, turning occasionally towards the queen, who smiled at him from behind the gauze of her veil, while all their foreheads touched the ground.
They thus reached the fortress of Nisio-Nosiro and crossed its ramparts. The Sky Riders came to receive the Kisaki. Her wives had stayed behind in the summer palace; she was asked if they should go and fetch them.
- Why?" she said; "aren't we going back to the palace?
They didn't dare answer her, as the Mikado, not reassured, refused to leave the fortress and intended to stay there.
The Son of the Gods was exasperated; victory had not calmed his fear or his anger. He, attacked in his palace! Not by Mongols, not by Chinese, by Japanese! His people, in other words his slaves, those who were not worthy to speak his name, had had the unheard-of audacity to take up arms against him. His sacred person had been forced not just to walk, but to run. The mikado, the one whose gaze could reduce a man to ashes, had fled pale with fear; the rigid folds of his satin robes had been disturbed; he had stumbled in the waves of fabric as he ran through the streets. What had become of the sacred majesty and divine prestige of the descendant of the gods in the midst of this adventure?
Go-Mitsou-No, furious, trembling and stunned, was not pacified by the victory. He ordered the massacre of all the soldiers who had submitted.
- They will come back against me," he said, "kill them to the last man.
- We'll kill them later," replied the Minister of the Right Hand, one of the highest dignitaries in the Dairi.
Then the Mikado cried out:
- Bring me Hiéyas, gouge out his eyes, rip out his entrails, cut him to pieces!
- Later," said the Minister of the Left Hand, "Hieyas is now beyond our reach.
- Call together all the warriors, all the princes, all the ministers," cried the Mikado, "I want to tell them my will.
There was nothing to object to. But the surprise was great: the Mikado had a will and was showing the desire to make a speech. Such a thing had not been seen since the general Yoritomo, under the reign of Tsoutsi-Mikado, had repulsed the invasion of the Mongols and received the title of Siogun for this fine deed. Since then, the sioguns had reigned in the name of the Mikados, who had never thought of taking back the sceptre, which they had entrusted to other hands. Was the true master finally waking up from his long torpor? Was he thinking of seizing power again and governing his kingdom himself? The ministers looked at each other, vaguely afraid; some of them secretly favoured Hiéyas, others were loyal to the dynasty of the mikados, but they lacked energy and feared any revolt against those who were the masters of the army.
But since the son of the gods had the whim to command, there was no escaping obedience. The lords and warriors were hastily assembled in the largest room in the castle. The mikado sat cross-legged on a platform surrounded by a small balustrade. The folds of his robes were arranged around him; then the lords sat on the ground, holding a long, narrow screen in front of their faces, to put an obstacle between their gaze and the face of the sovereign.
The Prince of Nagato, Farou-So-Chan, who was chief of the Sky Riders, Simabara, General Yama-Kava, all the ministers and all the lords were present.
Go-Mitsou-No glared at them, his cheeks even paler than usual, then blew loudly as if he wanted to scatter grains of dust.
Finally he spoke, abruptly and a little tearfully.
- So," he said, "I'm no longer the master, I'm no longer the representative of the gods. I'm under siege, I'm being insulted, I'm being taken over! I'm surprised you're still alive. What is the meaning of all this? Is this the way to treat a god? I'm the mikado, the supreme lord, have we forgotten that? I am on earth for the good of mankind, when I could be with my family in heaven. If things go on like this, I'll leave you. Are you not trembling? What are you thinking about? Have you not heeded the signs of anger shown by my heavenly ancestors?
Remember: not long ago, a mountain suddenly rose from the sea off the island of Fatsisio; isn't that terrible? Isn't it a sign of the displeasure that men inspire in the gods? The ground will shake again, and everything will be turned upside down. A few days after this mountain rose from the water, did it not rain hair in the vicinity of Osaka? Is that not a sign of doom? Are you deaf and blind? Do you no longer understand the threats of heaven? Are you hardened to crime? Do you fear nothing, since you do not tremble under the breath of my wrath?
- We are your faithful servants," said the minister of the Right Hand.
- I, Go-Mitsou-No, the one hundred and nineteenth of my race," continued the mikado, "have been insulted, and if the earth has not split into four pieces it is only because my feet are still on its surface, it has been spared because of me. Yes, men, my subjects, came to the dairi, they forced open the doors, they wanted to take me, to make the son of the gods a prisoner! and, to escape them, I had to flee. A mikado fleeing from men! I'm choking with rage. I'll plunge you into darkness, I'll extinguish the sun, I'll turn the seas upside down and I'll blow the earth to smithereens.
- We are your submissive slaves," said the Minister of the Left Hand.
- If you are my slaves, obey me," cried the son of the gods, "I command that all be ended, that the war cease, and that all things return to their usual order.
- Divine Lord! Master of our destinies!" said the Prince of Nagato, "do you allow me to speak in your presence?
- Speak," said the Mikado.
- The monster known as Hiéyas," said the prince, "fears nothing and insults the gods; yet if the order you have just given were served on him in front of the whole of Japan, he would be forced to obey and would consent to peace.
- Explain yourself," said Go-Mitsou-No.
- It is with sorrow that I note," continued the prince, "that despite the many defeats he has suffered, Hieyas is still the strongest, his supporters are increasing day by day, but they would rapidly diminish and soon all would abandon him if he openly resisted a universally known order emanating from the Mikado.
- There's no doubt about it," cried the ministers and lords.
- What should we do?" asked the Mikado, addressing the Prince of Nagato.
- Sublime master", said the prince, "I am of the opinion that a herald should be sent to all the towns and villages to proclaim your will; at the same time, a deputation composed of a large number of men should be sent to Fide-Yori and Hiéyas to tell them that they must stop the war, that this is your will.
- We will follow your advice," said the Mikado, "it is good advice. To thank you for it, I give you the title of Naï-daï-Tsin.
- Lord," cried the prince, "I am not worthy of such an honour.
- Send the envoys away quickly," said the Mikado. No more war, just rest and peace as before. I feel exhausted by all these emotions," he added more quietly, addressing the Prime Minister, "I could well die.
They soon parted.
On leaving the castle, the Prince of Nagato met a messenger looking for him.
- Where are you from?" asked Ivakoura.
- From Nagato.
So the messenger recounted all the events that had taken place in the province: the battles, the capture of Hagui, the capture of Fatkoura by the lord of Toza.
- How!" exclaimed Nagato, "Fatkoura is in the hands of that wretch who has princes beheaded. I cannot delay my revenge a moment longer. I shall leave at once to rescue her and make this infamous man pay dearly for his crimes and his impudence.
The prince enquired about his little troop. He wanted to know what the morning's battle had left him. Of the two hundred sailors, eighty had been killed, fifty were wounded and around sixty were fit to set sail again.
Raïden had been hit in the arm by an arrow, but the bone had not been affected; the sailor had had his arm bandaged and claimed not to feel anything. He begged the prince to take him with him.
- The journey will do me good," he said, "besides there are only sixty of us left, which is not much to take a kingdom, and with such a small number a man more or less is something.
- I need twenty thousand men to march against Toza," said the prince, "I'm going to ask the Siogun for them.
- Have I behaved badly that you want to keep me away from you?" said Raïden.
- No, my good servant," said the prince, smiling, "come if you like, and stop at Osaka if your wound hurts.
- Are we leaving at once?" asked the sailor.
- Are you mad!" exclaimed the Prince, "we've had a hard night and an even harder day, you're wounded and you don't even think of taking a rest! I confess that if you are tireless, I, who am by nature very unchalant, feel exhausted.
- If I'm allowed to sleep, I'll sleep heartily," laughed Raïden, "but if we had to set off again, I'd still have been able to stand up.
- Where's Loo?" asked the prince, "I lost sight of him in the battle.
- He's sleeping in a house on the shore, and so soundly that I could pick him up and carry him off without him noticing. This young samurai earned his sleep well, he had taken the rifle of one of our fallen companions and I was told that he fought like a demon.
- Is he unharmed?
- Luckily, he doesn't have a scratch on him.
- Well, go and join him and get some rest; tomorrow, around midday, we'll be leaving.
The next day, Nagato went to say goodbye to the Kisaki; she had returned to the summer palace, and he saw her among her wives.
- You're already leaving this city, which owes you victory, without taking the time to rest?
- I'm going away with a heavy heart," said the prince, "but an imperious duty calls me; before peace is signed, I must avenge the outrage done to my name, I must save Fatkoura, my fiancée.
- Is Fatkoura in danger?
- She is the prisoner of the Prince of Toza; a messenger brought me this news yesterday.
- Such reasons cannot be denied," said the queen; "hasten to punish this infamous man, and may the god of battles be good to you.
His voice trembled a little as he spoke; he was going to run into danger again, expose his life and perhaps die.
- I think I'm invincible," said Nagato, "an all-powerful goddess
powerful goddess protects me.
The Kisaki tried to smile.
- May you triumph and return promptly," she said.
The prince walked away. Before leaving the room, he looked at her again; a strange anxiety chilled his heart.
- Every time I part from her, it seems to me that I must never see her again," he murmured.
She also looked at him, troubled by the same anguish; she pressed the tip of the fan the prince had given her to her lips.
He withdrew from her presence.
That same evening, he arrived in Osaka and immediately went to see the siogun.
- It's you!" exclaimed Fidé-Yori with joy. I didn't expect to see you again so soon; your presence is a relief in the midst of the troubles that are weighing me down.
- What!" said Ivakoura, "we are victorious. Why are you sad?
- What are you saying, friend? It is true that Yoké-Moura has driven the enemy from the village they occupied near Osaka; but Harounaga has just been completely defeated by retreating to Yamasiro. Our enemy now holds two thirds of the kingdom.
- Never mind! We have won at Soumiossi; we have thrown the camp of Hiéyas into disarray; we have triumphed at Kioto, and the Son of the Gods, coming out of his torpor for a moment, is going to order the two parties to reconcile.
- Hiéyas will refuse.
- He cannot refuse; he cannot openly rebel against the Mikado.
- He who attacked him with such sacrilegious audacity!
- He attacked him to take control and dictate his will. The imprisoned mikado was nothing; the free mikado, seizing power for a moment, is all-powerful.
- Hiéyas will impose unacceptable conditions on me. It is in his interest to continue the war.
- Nevertheless, he will be forced to obey for the time being, and what we need above all is a few months' respite.
- Certainly, we could then muster all our forces. Communications have been cut off, the armies of the princes have not arrived.
- Are Signenari and his twenty thousand men still on the island of Avadsi?
- Always," said the siogun, "and the young general is in despair at having been reduced to inaction.
- I just want to ask you to give him the order to enter the campaign.
- What do you mean by that?
- I have a personal injury to avenge, and I beg you to lend me this army.
- What do you want to avenge, friend?
- Against one of those who betrayed you, the Prince of Toza. He attacked my kingdom, sacked my fortress, kidnapped my fiancée, and deceived by a resemblance, he thought he had me, and refusing him the death of nobles he cut off the head of one of my servants.
- Such things can only be washed away with blood," said Fide-Yori, "I will give you an order for Signenari, and I will place a war junk at your disposal. Do not spare this infamous Toza, this traitor, envious and cowardly, unworthy of the rank he occupies.
- I'll have his towers razed to the ground, his crops burnt and I'll kill him like a pig being slaughtered," said the prince, regretting that he had only one life to pay for all his crimes.
- May you succeed!" said the Siogun. Alas!" he added, "I was looking forward to seeing you again, and you arrive to leave again! What solitude, what emptiness around me! what sadness! My heart is gnawed by a secret sorrow that I can't talk about. One day I'll confide it in you, and that will make me feel better.
The prince looked up at the siogun; he remembered that several times before a confession had reached the king's lips, and that a sort of savagery and modesty had stopped him there. This time too, Fidé-Yori became confused and looked away.
- What is it?" said Nagato to himself.
Then he added loudly:
- I promise I'll never leave you again, once my revenge is complete.
On leaving the Siogun's flat, the Prince of Nagato met Yodogimi.
- Ah, there you are, beautiful victor," she said to him bitterly, "you have come to reap the praise deserved by your fine conduct.
- It is only from your charming lips that praise would be sweet to me," said the prince, bowing with a slightly outraged politeness, "but they have only harsh and contemptuous words for me.
- If we are enemies, it's because you wanted us to be," said Yodogimi.
- I always wanted not to displease you, but my lack of merit betrayed me. You declared war on me, but I didn't accept it and remained your slave.
- A very unassuming slave who draws all the light to himself, allowing no-one else to shine beside him.
- Do I really shine so brightly?" said the prince. And now, in spite of yourself, you're letting slip the praise you've been refusing me.
- Stop jeering!" exclaimed Yodogimi, "I'm happy to tell you that while everyone loves you and cheers you, I hate you.
- She won't forgive me for the defeat of Harounaga," murmured the prince.
Yodogimi walked away, giving Nagato an angry look. In the past, the beautiful princess had secretly loved Ivakoura; the prince had not wanted to see this love; hence the hatred with which Yodogimi pursued him.
Nagato left the palace, and a few hours later he set sail for the island of Avadsi.
XXIII
FATKOURA
The captive of the lord of Toza found the days long and monotonous. She waited for the avenger, certain that he would come to free her, but telling herself that he was a little late. She was obsessed by Toza's growing love for her. After the execution of the man he believed to be Nagato, he had refrained from visiting her; then, realising that Fatkoura's pain was not very violent, and that she seemed resigned, he had conceived some hope and resumed pestering her. At times he was humble, submissive and suppliant; at others he became angry and threatened; sometimes he tried to soften the young woman with tears, but she remained implacable.
- Tears of a tiger," she would say, "who sees his prey escape him.
- You won't escape me!" cried Toza.
Fatkoura was rigorous with Tika; she had realised that the young maid was favouring the prince's love. Tika's plan was to make his mistress a princess of Toza. "Since the Prince of Nagato is dead! she said. Besides, Fatkoura was soon consoled by his loss.
- You're free now," she told her one day, "you can love the Prince of Toza.
- I will never love anyone but Ivakoura," the young woman replied.
- Loving a dead man won't last, Tika thought.
But from that day on, Fatkoura no longer spoke to her, she didn't even allow her to be in her presence. Tika cried against the door; her mistress pretended not to hear her. However, she missed her young companion more than she cared to admit.
This companion in her misfortunes, this confidante of her sadness and sorrows, was necessary to her life. Captivity seemed harder to her since she had exiled her from her side; she missed one thing above all: not being able to talk about her beloved with Tika.
She resolved to forgive her and tell her that the prince was still alive.
One day, she called him.
Repentant Tika knelt down in the middle of the room, hid her face behind her wide sleeves and let her tears flow.
- You won't speak to me about the Prince of Toza again," said Fatkoura.
- Never, mistress," said Tika, "except to curse him.
- Well, I forgive you; speak to me of my beloved as you did before.
- Alas, he is dead," said Tika; "I can only mourn him with you.
- Don't you think I was quick to console myself?
Tika, surprised, looked up at her mistress, who was smiling.
- But it seemed to me..." she stammered. I thought he was wrong to let himself be defeated in front of you.
- If I told you that he has never been defeated, that he is alive...
- He triumphs in your heart, he's alive in your mind, that's what you mean.
- No, he still breathes the earth's atmosphere.
- Alas, that's impossible. Before our very eyes, I still shudder, his pale head has bounced off the ground.
- This man who died in front of us was not Ivakoura.
- Has his mind been disturbed by pain?" said Tika, looking at her mistress with fear.
- Do you think I'm mad?" said Fatkoura, "you'll see when he comes to open the doors of this prison whether I've told the truth.
Tika didn't dare contradict her mistress, and pretended to believe that Nagato was alive.
- Better this strange hallucination than the despair that would have overwhelmed her! she said to herself.
They began again, as before at the Dairi, to talk about the absent man. They remembered the words he had said, the anecdotes he had told. They tried to imitate the inflection of his voice; they reconstructed his every toilet, remembering his features, his smile, his attitudes.
Often they would have long discussions about a detail, a date, a phrase he had said.
In this way, the hours flew by.
Every day the Prince of Toza sent presents to Fatkoura: flowers, rare birds, marvellous fabrics. Every day Fatkoura flapped the birds and threw the fabrics and flowers out of the window. The prince never tired. In the middle of the day, he would visit the prisoner and talk to her about his love.
One day, however, he entered Fatkoura's house with a strange expression on his face.
He waved Tika away with a gesture that brooked no reply; then he walked over to Fatkoura and stared at her.
- Are you determined always to resist me?" he said after a silence.
- Always, and to hate you as much as I despise you.
- Is that your last word? Think again.
- I don't have to think, I hated you as soon as I saw you, and I'll hate you until the day I die.
- Well then!" exclaimed the Prince in a terrible voice, "I will know how to force you to become my wife.
- I defy you," said Fatkoura, who did not lower her eyes to meet the prince's gaze.
- I swear I will defeat you, just as I defeated your fiancé.
Fatkoura smiled mockingly.
- Yes," continued the prince, "you have wearied my patience; my love had made me merciful, timid, fearful even. I begged, I cried, I waited! I gave your pain time to heal. Your refusals inflamed my tenderness, I got carried away, then I humiliated myself. But I'm tired of this long torture; the prayers are over; no more sweetness, no more tears, from now on you'll be the one crying, begging. One last time, will you
do you want to love me?
- The vulture asks no gratitude from the bird it smothers in its claws, but you demand the love of a woman whose husband you have killed.
- I know you'll never love me," says Toza, "but you'll tell me you love me, and you'll try to make me believe it.
- I'm curious to know the means you'll use to make me say such things.
- You will know soon enough," said the prince, who walked away.
From that day on, a series of sufferings began for the prisoner. First she was separated from Tika and locked in her flat; then the windows were shut, letting in only a little daylight from above. In this way Fatkoura was deprived of the view of the gardens and the fresh evening air. She was served food she didn't like. Little by little, all the things she could use disappeared. Each day made her situation worse. None of the servants cared for her any more. Soon she was put in a prison, then lowered into a dungeon where she had to wait all day for a bowl of cooled rice.
- That's how he makes himself loved!
said Fatkoura, sustained by the hope of deliverance.
But one day, suddenly, these rigours ceased and the young woman was taken back to the pavilion she had first occupied.
She saw Tika again, looking very cheerful.
- The province of Toza has been invaded," she exclaimed; "an army is approaching and we shall be delivered.
- You can see that he is coming, my lord, my beloved husband," said Fatkoura.
He is coming to relieve us of our sorrow and avenge the man who died so bravely in his place.
There is only talk of General Signénari, sent by the Siogoun.
- You can be sure that Ivakoura is close to him.
- It's possible," said the young girl.
- It's certain! So I'm going to see him again at last. After so much suffering, happiness is going to return! Do we know anything about the battle?
- The Prince of Toza left in a hurry. His soldiers, who were not expecting this attack and who were resting after their victory, were completely beaten. The Siogoun army is a few leagues from here.
- They will soon be within these walls," said Fatkoura, "and we will once again undergo a siege, but whereas at Hagui we wanted to win, this time we will tremble at the prospect of victory.
A few days passed in feverish anticipation.
Suddenly, the army of the Prince of Toza, driven by a rout, stormed back into the fortress. The gates were closed.
The siege began.
Without giving the besieged time to recognise each other, the attackers launched an assault.
A terrible noise filled the castle. Inside, there was confusion, constant coming and going, calls and shouts. Outside, there was non-stop banging. Tika ran to get the news, came back and left again. On the third day, the soldiers suddenly moved to the same spot. A breach had been made. Cries of discouragement went up from all sides.
- We'd better surrender.
- We can't hold out much longer.
- We are lost.
Towards midday, the Prince of Toza suddenly entered Fatkoura's flat.
She was standing by a window, looking out; joy lit up her face.
She turned round and saw her enemy staring at her with his arms folded. A sort of instinctive fear seized her when she saw him. He was pale, with a sinister expression. In his right hand he held a bloody sword that was dripping on the floor. He calmly put it back in his belt.
- The battle is lost," he sneered, "I am defeated.
- The man you thought you'd dishonoured is at your door, coming to punish your crimes," said Fatkoura.
- Ah, you know that Nagato is not dead," exclaimed the prince, "but that doesn't matter, he is here, it's true, he's coming to free you, but before he takes you back," he added in a thunderous voice, "before he has crossed the crumbling walls of my castle, you understand, you will belong to me.
Fatkoura leapt backwards and retreated to the back of the flat.
- You can guess," continued Toza, "that I have not left the battle for nothing. The winners are hot on my heels. I won't waste time in vain pleas.
He walked towards Fatkoura.
Help me!" she cried in a heart-rending voice, "Help me, Tika!
Nagato! Come to my aid!
Toza put his hand over her mouth.
- What's the point of screaming? he said, no one will come. Resign yourself, you're mine now; you can't escape me.
He had wrapped his arms around her, but suddenly he saw something shining above her eyes. Fatkoura had just grabbed the long dagger from the prince's belt.
- You are mistaken, I'm escaping you this time too," she said. My last thought is of you, Ivakoura.
Toza shrieked; he had seen the dagger disappear down to the hilt into the young woman's chest, then she pulled it out and threw it to the ground.
At that moment, the panel closing the entrance shattered. The Prince of Nagato, sword in hand, rushed into the room.
He pounced on the Lord of Toza.
- Ah, you wretch!" he cried, "you insult your captive, my betrothed! You add this unparalleled crime to all your previous ones! But the hour of vengeance has come, the earth will be delivered from you!
Toza had drawn his sabre; it clashed with Nagato's, but he was trembling; a superstitious fear froze him; he felt he was going to die.
Ivakoura, with irresistible strength, pushed him back to the other side of the flat. He cornered him against a panel.
Toza, his eyes bloodshot, looked at his opponent in horror; he was defending himself badly. Nagato knocked the sword out of his hand.
- Now you're going to die," said Ivakoura; "I'm going to kill you, not like freeing yourself from a loyal enemy, but like crushing a scorpion.
And with a tremendous blow of his sabre, he nailed him to the partition by the throat.
Fatkoura had not fallen. She had remained leaning against the wall, pressing her hand against her wound, blood gushing through her fingers.
The Prince of Nagato abandoned his enemy, who was writhing in terrible agony, and ran towards her, seeing the blood trickling down.
- What's the matter?" he cried.
- I'm dying," said Fatkoura.
She slipped to the ground, and the prince knelt down beside her and supported her on his knees.
- Is anyone here?" he shouted, "bring the doctors.
- I beg you," said Fatkoura, "don't call, there's nothing anyone can do for my wound. It was to spare your name from being insulted: I've hit hard, I can't be saved. Don't send for anyone, let me die near you, since I couldn't live there.
- Unfortunate woman, this is where I have brought you!" exclaimed the prince, "it is for my sake that you are dying after a life of suffering; you, so beautiful, so young, and who were made for happiness. Ah! why did I find myself in your way?
- I was happy for a while," says Fatkoura, "very happy, you seemed to love me, but I paid dearly for those days of joy. What had I done to you, cruel one, to make you desert me like that?
- You guessed it, sweet princess; an all-powerful, invincible love turned me away from you, my will no longer obeyed my reason.
- What can you do against love? I know how it tames you, I who tried in vain to hate you. Yes! you have experienced these acute tortures, these aimless expectations, these feverish dreams, these hopes that don't want to die; you have known these sobs that don't relieve, these tears that burn like a rain of fire. In the grip of an impossible love, you suffered as much as I did. Isn't that awful, and don't you feel some compassion for me?
- To repair the harm I have done you, I would like to give my life.
- Don't you have rest neither night nor day? It's as if you were at the bottom of a precipice lined with steep rocks; you want to climb back up, then you fall back down again. But I am mad," added Fatkoura, "your suffering is nothing compared to mine, you were loved.
The prince shuddered.
- Yes, she loves you, I know it," continued Fatkoura with a faint smile. Do you think that the jealous gaze of the scorned woman has not been able to read her eyes? How their pride was extinguished when they weighed themselves on you, how her voice, in spite of itself, became soft when it was you she was talking to, what joyful anxiety on your arrival, what sadness after your departure! I watched, and every discovery was a sword stroke for me. Rage, hatred and love tore at my heart. No, you didn't suffer as much as I did.
- Don't blame me, Fatkoura," said the prince, "I didn't deserve such love. You are here dying because of me, and I cannot save you. The horrible pain that is gripping me at this moment will avenge you for all the suffering I have caused you.
- I'm happy now," says Fatkoura, "I could have died before you arrived, and now I'm close to you.
- But you won't die," exclaimed the prince. Am I a fool to stand by, stupid with fear, instead of coming to your aid and having your wound dressed! You're young, you'll heal.
- What's the point," says Fatkoura. Will you love me afterwards?
- I'll love you as I love you, with infinite tenderness.
- Like you love your sister," murmured Fatkoura with a bitter smile. Ah, let me die.
- Alas, this blood that is leaking out and taking your life!" cried the prince, mad with grief.
He began to shout violently. They were heard. Soldiers and servants invaded the room. General Signénari came too, still bleeding from the battle. They moved aside as he passed.
- What's happening, Prince?" he cried.
- A doctor, by grace, and right away," said Nagato; "my fiancée has stabbed herself to death to escape the outrages of the infamous Toza; she's dying.
Fatkoura had lost consciousness.
The palace doctor soon arrived. He uncovered the wound and, on seeing her, made a grimace that was hardly reassuring.
- She didn't spare herself," he said.
- Can she be saved?" asked the Prince of Nagato.
The doctor shook his head.
- I don't think so," he said, "the iron went in too deep.
When I have dressed the wound, the blood will no longer flow outwards, but it will flow inwards and suffocate her.
- And if you didn't close the wound?
- The woman would be dead in a few minutes.
The doctor brought his lips close to the wound. When he touched the raw wound, Fatkoura didn't twitch. He shook his head a second time.
- A bad symptom," he murmured.
When the dressing was finished, he placed the neck of a small bottle containing a comforting liqueur between the young woman's lips and made her drink it all.
Fatkoura soon opened her eyes again; she was still leaning on Nagato's lap. Tika was sobbing at her feet.
She cast a disgruntled glance at those who filled the room; with a slow, painful gesture she motioned for them to be removed.
Signenari let them out and left, leaving only the doctor and Tika.
- You disobeyed me, Ivakura," said the dying woman in a voice that was growing weaker.
- I wanted to save you.
- I am lost... What would I have done in this world?
Spasms seized her, she stretched out her arms, blood choking her.
- Air!" she cried.
Tika rushed over and opened all the windows. Then her mistress saw her.
- Goodbye, Tika," she said, "you see he wasn't defeated, he wasn't dead! We will speak of him no more.
The young woman next to her wept, her face in her hands.
Fatkoura raised her gaze to the prince.
- Let me see you," she said, "it's been so long since my eyes have reflected your face! How beautiful you are, my beloved!
beloved! - You see," she continued, addressing the doctor, "he is my husband, he came to rescue me from captivity, but Toza insulted me and I threw myself to my death.
She spoke in an interrupted, muffled voice, growing weaker and weaker. Her eyes widened, a waxen pallor invaded her face.
- Tell your father about me, Ivakura," she continued; "he liked me! I told him I'd never see the castle again. I was almost happy there. I saw the room where you were born, your childhood clothes... Ah, I did love you!
She was panting; beads of sweat were beading on her forehead. She tore the bandage from her wound.
- Ivakoura," she said, "I can't see you any more.
closer... Ah!" she suddenly exclaimed, "to leave while he's here!
- She's dying!" cried the distraught prince.
- She's dead," said the doctor.
Tika screamed in pain. The prince hid his face in his hands.
- All suffering is over for her," said the doctor; "she rests and forgets her torments in the serene tranquillity of the last sleep.
XXIV
THE PEACE TREATY
Hiéyas agreed to put an end to the war, but, as Fidé-Yori had said, his conditions were harsh.
- I demand," he said, "that one of the following three proposals be carried out: that Fide-Yori abandon the fortress and spend seven years in Yamato; that Yodogimi be given to me as a hostage; or that the walls and ditches of Osaka Castle be demolished and filled in.
Only the last proposal was acceptable. This was the opinion of the generals meeting in a council of war. Yoké-Moura, however, considered the destruction of the ramparts deplorable.
- This peace will be short-lived," he said, "and if the war resumes, what will become of us with our castle dismantled?
He was in favour of letting Yodogimi go.
- My mother! Are you thinking about it," exclaimed the siogun. With such a hostage in his hands, we'd be nothing more than slaves to Hiéyas.
- It's true," exclaimed General Harounaga, "we can't think of that.
- Our walls are demolished and we are defenceless. War was better than a peace like that," said Yoké-Moura.
He would gladly have sent Yodogimi; he didn't care much for a woman.
- Hiéyas has specified," someone said, "that the ditches must be filled in so that three-year-olds can climb in and out without difficulty.
- Ten thousand workmen will have to knock down the walls in a hurry," said another.
Yoké-Moura sighed.
- We have to accept that," said the siogoun, "we'll be forced to do it. At the slightest hint of war, we'll raise the walls and dig up the ditches.
- Since you demand it," said Yoké-Moura, "I agree with you; let's demolish the fortress.
- I have charged General Signénari with going to the camp of Hiéyas to exchange peace treaties; he will represent me with dignity and, I am sure, will conduct himself nobly in this delicate matter.
- I will do my utmost to deserve the trust you have placed in me," says Signénari. I await your orders for departure.
- You have barely wiped away the sword that has just chastised the province of Toza," said the Siogun, "if you need a day's rest, take it.
- I'll leave tonight", said Signénari.
The same day, in fact, the young general, accompanied by a large and magnificent escort, left for the usurper's camp.
After the forest fire, in which some of his men had perished, Hiéyas had moved to the neighbouring plain. He did not want to abandon this position so close to Osaka. Reinforcements arrived and he marched against Harounaga, who was still occupying Soumiossi. The general was defeated and his army routed. However, Hiéyas left only a vanguard on the conquered site and returned to his camp. It was there that he received the order from the Mikado to make peace. Hiéyas had then called some of the lords of his council to him: Ovari, Dathé, Todo, Couroda; they were all of the opinion that it was impossible to resist the order of the son of the gods; that we should apparently give in, but create an obstacle to the signing of the treaty.
- Let's make sure that Fide-Yori refuses to sign the peace treaty," said Hiéyas. That way, the wrath of heaven will fall on him.
Much to his surprise, Hiéyas was told that an envoy had arrived from Osaka. Fide-Yori accepted the conditions imposed.
- Who is he sending?" asked Hiéyas.
General Signénari.
The young warrior, whose heroism was well known, was held in high esteem even by his enemies. When he arrived in military costume and rode through the camp, the sovereign princes greeted him.
Signenari did not respond to the salutes.
- What is the meaning of this pride?" asked a lord.
Someone said:
- He represents the siogoun Fidé-Yori, he must not salute.
He was ushered into the master's tent.
Hiéyas was seated at the back on a folding bed, and mats had been laid out on the ground to his right and left. The princes and generals were present.
They tried to seat Signénari next to the princes, but he didn't seem to understand and sat down opposite Hiéyas.
- It's true," said a lord in a low voice, "this warrior, despite his great youth, has already acquired the dignity and prudence of an old man.
Signénari unrolled a piece of paper.
- These are the words of my master, the siogun Fide-Yori, son of the siogun Taïko-Sama," he said. And he read the scroll he held in his hands: "I, Fide-Yori, General-in-Chief of the Mikado armies, agree, in order to put an end to the unjust war declared against me by Hiéyas, which is devastating the kingdom, to accept one of the conditions imposed by my adversary for the conclusion of peace; I will demolish the first wall of the fortress of Osaka and I will fill in the moats, so that all hostility will cease and we will lay down our arms. "I have written this in all sincerity, on the fifteenth day of the second autumn moon, in the nineteenth year of Nengo Kai-Tio, and I sign with my Fide-Yori blood."
- If this is so," said Hiéyas in his weak, trembling voice, "I accept the peace.
He sent for writing materials and dictated to a secretary:
"I, Minamoto Hiéyas, proclaimed siogoun by the predecessor of Go-Mitzou-No, in the name of the siogoun Fidé-Tadda, in whose favour I have abdicated, agree to put an end to the war, on condition that Fidé-Yori has the walls of Osaka castle thrown down and its moats filled in, so that three-year-old children can go down and come back up while playing."
Hiéyas was given a new paintbrush and a long needle with which to prick the tip of his finger in order to sign in his own blood.
He pricked himself weakly and obtained only a pale droplet; he signed nevertheless, and the treaty was passed to Signénari.
- This won't do," said the general, casting his eyes over the paper, "the blood is too pale. Your name is illegible, start again.
- But," said Hiéyas, "I am old, weak and ill; for me, a drop of blood is precious.
Signénari pretended not to hear.
With a sigh, Hiéyas pricked himself again and strengthened his signature; only then did the young general give him the treaty signed by Fidé-Yori.
XXV
CONFIDENCES
A wild joy filled Osaka. This city of pleasure, luxury and perpetual festivities abhorred war, political conflict and bereavement, all of which prevented it from enjoying itself: entertainment being, for the inhabitants, the main aim of life. So that was it! The face stretched out by sadness and worry could be replaced by a face enlarged and full of laughter. At the first news of peace, the whole city began to dance, the sailors on the quays of the Yodo-Gava, the merchants at the threshold of their houses, the servants in the courtyards of the palaces. The wealthy individuals, the civil servants and the nobles were no less pleased, if they were a little more reserved in expressing their joy. The princesses in particular were happy: confined to their palaces, separated from their husbands, they had thought they were growing old in this war. They were waking up from a nightmare. They would still be allowed to be beautiful, to smile, to adorn themselves.
They ran to the great lacquer chests and, amid the scent of musk and precious woods, pulled out the superb dresses they had buried there, to adopt darker clothes. The floor was an admirable heap of satin, silk and crepe in the most tender colours. But the dresses were found to be a little faded and wrinkled, and the manufacturers, tailors and embroiderers were called in.
That very evening, the court announced a party on the water, in which the wealthy inhabitants of Osaka could take part. It was a fever. There was little time to prepare and decorate the boats.
Evening came and the river lit up.
Thousands of boats, garlanded with lanterns, left the banks and glided slowly up and down the river.
The court boats soon arrived. Wider and more beautiful than the other boats, they were lined with silk fabrics that spilled over and dragged across the water, lit by huge round lanterns made of gauze or painted glass, and surrounded by the multicoloured rustle of countless banners. Under the shelter of magnificent tents, stretched out nonchalantly on cushions, amid the many folds of their dresses, graceful women appeared in the soft light.
The embroidery of their kirimon and the large, radiant pins of their headdresses gleamed. Lords stood beside them, telling them a thousand foolish things, which they laughed at, tilting their heads a little. Long, luminous snakes danced on the water.
At the widest point of the river, where the banks are cut into vast tiers over a long stretch, fireworks were set off on rafts, waiting to be lit when the court arrived. A huge crowd, boisterous and full of joy, lined the terraces along the banks and watched the festivities.
The spectators, some standing, others sitting or lying down, all carried lanterns and took part in the illumination. There was no shortage of sake barrels: they tumbled down from the banks, rolling and bouncing amid shouts and laughter. A few fell into the water, and it was quite a comedy to catch them; several sank; nevertheless, everyone was soon drunk.
Fidé-Yori attended the party incognito. He and the Prince of Nagato were riding in a light, dimly-lit boat. Two men standing at the bow were steering it.
Half-reclining on cushions, the two friends silently watched the boats come and go.
The clear voices of female singers of national legends could be heard, accompanied by the biva or the semsin. Orchestras passed by, drowning out the gentle female song with their noisy music. But all of a sudden, the fireworks exploded, rockets shot off in all directions, sprays of fire bloomed and rained down stars. Once they had started, the fireworks never stopped, the pieces being renewed as they went up in smoke. They whistled, sparkled and radiated continuously.
The boat carrying Fidé-Yori came across the one carrying her mother Yodogimi. The princess, fully illuminated, appeared in a resplendent toilette. Her boat was entirely upholstered in gold brocade; the tent, made of purple satin, had tassels of pearls at each corner. General Harounaga, completely drunk, was laughing loudly, sprawled on the cushions.
The siogun turned his head away. The boat passed. Fidé-Yori heard the soldier's laughter for a moment longer.
The Prince of Nagato was dreaming; he was looking at nothing but the reflection of the lights in the water; he thought he saw embers, jewels, flames and molten metal shimmering in the water. He snapped out of his reverie, but finding that the silence was dragging on too long, he looked up at the siogun. Fidé-Yori's face was deeply melancholy, yet the young man searched every passing boat with an avid gaze.
Nagato examined him for a few moments.
- What is he looking for?" he asked himself.
Fide-Yori was obviously looking for someone; he let out a deep sigh whenever his hopes were disappointed.
- Master," said Ivakoura at last, "the whole nation is rejoicing today. I thought that sadness had taken refuge in my heart alone, but I see that you have kept some of it.
- I should indeed appear happy," says Fidé-Yori; "but to you I show myself as I am. You see, friend, a moral wound that won't heal is torturing me. The kingdom is at peace, but my heart is not.
- Do you remember, a few days ago, you promised to confide your grief to me.
- I wanted to do so a long time ago; I don't know what strange modesty held me back; it seemed to me that this feeling, so sweet and so cruel, which I was experiencing for the first time, the one who had inspired it should be the first to know it.
- You are in love, my friend, I suspected it. But why do you suffer for this love?
- The one I love saved my life, I've only seen her once, her name is Omiti; that's all I know about her," said the siogun.
- Poor dear prince!" exclaimed Nagato; "and you couldn't find her?
- Alas!
- Do you know what class she belongs to?
- She's a noble girl," said Fidé-Yori; "her language and her appearance have revealed that to me. But even if she belongs to the ranks of the reprobate, if ever heaven allows me to find her, she will be my wife.
- We'll look for her together," said Nagato.
- I'm looking for her right now, in the middle of this crowd.
Every boat that goes by, laden with women, makes my heart beat faster and faster.
- Do you think she lives in Osaka?" said the Prince of Nagato.
- I hope so and have a premonition of it," said Fidé-Yori.
- Then she is certainly at this party. Which young lady will be staying at home today?
- I thought the same as you, friend," said the siogun; "that's why I'm here.
- Let's see, give me a few words about the girl you love," said Nagato, "so that I can help you in your search.
- She is full of exquisite grace, small, with very large eyes, she looks like a child; her smile is like a dewy flower.
- The portrait lacks a little precision," says Ivakoura, smiling. Never mind, let's have a look; you're here to correct any mistakes I make.
They ordered the boatmen to row quickly and cover the entire stretch of the river that the illuminated boats had crossed. The light boat began to glide like a swallow. It came and went, running from one bank to the other without ever bumping into the other boats. Not a single one escaped the scrutiny of the two friends, but their search was fruitless.
- She's called Omiti, don't you know anything more?" said Nagato.
- I know nothing. But I think the family she belongs to is one of my enemies. When she told me about the plot, she refused to name the people behind it.
- Ah!" exclaimed Nagato suddenly, "look at that young girl over there, isn't she the one you're looking for? I've never seen such beautiful eyes.
Fide-Yori turned round sharply.
- Ah!" he said, "you're joking, she's got thick lips and a squashed nose.
- It's true," said Nagato, "forgive me, she seemed pretty from a distance.
The boat carrying them arrived at the point where the river widened, and from where the fireworks continued to fly into the sky.
It was Fidé-Yori's turn to cry out.
Through a spray of fire he had thought he saw Omiti's face, and he was not mistaken.
- There! there!" he shouted, "get to that boat, hurry!
The oarsmen hurriedly tacked. But they had to make a diversion, as the large rafts carrying the fireworks were blocking the way. When we passed them, we didn't know which boat to go after. Fidé-Yori had only seen the young girl's face, he could no longer see it. He could not see the number of lanterns or the colours of the banners on the boat in which she had passed. Moreover, the place was so crowded with boats of all shapes and sizes that it was almost impossible to move around.
Fidé-Yori was trembling with emotion and worry.
- She's going to escape me," he said; "after waiting so long to find her, only to lose her immediately!
- Did you see which way the boat was going?
- It seemed to be going up the river.
- Well, let's head that way; it couldn't have gone that fast. We're like prisoners here; we'll find her.
Fidé-Yori regained his courage.
- Go back up the river," he said to the boatmen.
The young siogoun leaned over the edge and looked eagerly. A few people recognised him. A large number of court princesses, lords and warlords passed by him. He saw his mother and General Harounaga again, but the face he had been looking for was nowhere to be seen.
- Perhaps we went too fast," he said.
They stepped back, then climbed back up again.
- The party is coming to an end!" suddenly exclaimed Fidé-Yori.
Let's wait for this boat above the central crowding; when it pulls away, it will pass us by.
- Which way should we go?" said Nagato.
- On the upper town side, there are no noble dwellings on the seaward side.
They waited in vain; the boat didn't show up; it had gone down the river and headed towards the suburbs.
Fidé-Yori, discouraged, returned to the palace. The Prince of Nagato tried to console him.
- Are you sure that the woman you saw was the one you were looking for?
- Certainly!" cried Fidé-Yori; "I only saw her face once, but my eyes will never forget her.
- So," said the prince, "instead of being sad, rejoice. You only imagined that she lived in this town; now you are certain that she does. So we're sure to find her. You'll throw another party and she'll still be there.
- You're right, friend," said Fide-Yori, "you'll help me; we'll search the town. We'll find her, and she'll be my wife.
Then life, which has been full of sadness and disappointment for me, will begin to smile on me. From tomorrow, won't we?
We will study the city quarter by quarter and try to wrest its secrets from it. Oh, you've given me back my courage, you've made me almost happy!
Hope lit up the young Siogoun's eyes and a smile parted his lips.
Suddenly a cloud passed over his forehead.
- How selfish and cruel I am! he cried. You, my dearest friend, my devoted brother, have just lost the woman you loved, she died a terrible death, and I insult your grief by telling you of my love and my hope. I dare to be joyful when you are sorry.
- Master," said Nagato, "I am deeply saddened by the loss of the woman who died for me. I had a brotherly affection for her, but my fiancée was not the woman I loved.
- What are you saying," cried Fidé-Yori, "you've taken a huge weight off my heart. So you can still be happy, as happy as I am.
Ivakoura shook his head.
- My love is made up of light and shade," he said. I'll never be completely happy; it's part heavenly joy and part deep suffering; as it is, however, it's my whole life.
- Who do you love?" said Fidé-Yori.
- Oh, master," said the prince, putting his hand over his eyes, "don't ask me.
- It is so sweet to talk about the one you love. You see, since you became my confidant, my pain has been halved.
- I'm condemned to silence.
- Even from me? That's how you love me! I regret having opened my heart to you.
- As soon as I tell you who I love, you'll never speak to me again.
- Is it my mother?
- No," said Nagato, smiling.
- Then who is it? I beg you, tell me!
- The Kisaki.
- You wretch!" cried Fide-Yori.
And, just as the prince had predicted, he didn't add a word.
The next day, work began on demolishing the fortress walls. Ten thousand men tried hard: they resisted. They didn't know how to go about it; the stones were leaning against an earthen embankment, as if they were set into it. At the top, on the platform that formed a vast terrace, cedar trees grew up and spread shade. First, the towers projecting far and wide in front of the walls were attacked; they were thrown into the ditch, then blocks of the rampart were torn out and the work was completed. Only the demolished walls still seemed to be standing; the stones were no longer there, the mountain of earth remained, but the ditch had been filled in.
While this work of destruction was being accomplished, the city continued to rejoice. Fidé-Yori had a huge bell melted down and solemnly dedicated it to the temple of Buddha: From now on, my house will be peaceful.
Public celebrations were held to mark the dedication. Now a splendid performance was announced at Osaka's main theatre. A new drama was to be unveiled: Taïko-ki, the story of Taïko.
This semi-historical work had just been written in honour of Fide-Yori's father. The time was right to perform it, so everything was hastily prepared. But the staging had to be very meticulous, and the day of the performance had not yet been fixed.
It was the talk of the town. The seats were all reserved in advance; they were paid for with five or six kobangs
[1] . The women were going crazy as they prepared their outfits; the tailors and embroiderers were panting. The main actor who was to play Taiko was praised. Everyone knew him; he was famous. He was nicknamed Nariko-Ma, the "Snoring Top".
Fidé-Yori, too, was impatiently awaiting the day of the performance. He hoped Omiti would be there, and that at least she wouldn't be able to escape him. His searches of the town with the Prince of Nagato had produced no results. It was not as easy as they had imagined to enter every house and ask about a young girl. They started with the homes of the nobles. There, it was easier. The siogun would pay a visit, incognito, to the wives of absent lords; he had the fantasy of seeing the families of princesses, and thus reviewed all the noble girls of Osaka.
To enter the homes of wealthy individuals, the two friends were forced to disguise themselves, and they were not always well received.
Their tricks for getting the girls of the house to show themselves to them varied: they claimed to have seen a priceless object fall from a young girl's sleeve, which they wanted to return only to her. Or they claimed to have been sent by a despairing old man who had just lost his only daughter and was looking for a child of the same age who looked a bit like her, so that he could leave her his fortune, which was immense. This latest invention of the Prince of Nagato was quite successful, but the work was hard; they had already spent eight days on the search and had only visited the palaces and one street in Osaka.
- We'll never get to see all the houses in this immense city," said Fidé-Yori, "we're mad.
- We might grow old before we find what we're looking for," replied Nagato. Never mind, let's keep on looking, perhaps we'll come across it in the next house we enter.
Fidé-Yori sighed.
- Let's wait until the day the theatre opens its doors," he said.
Finally, large posters painted on silk fabrics or coloured paper announced the date of the performance.
- We'll see her at the theatre; I'm sure she'll be there," said the Siogoun, clinging to this hope.
XXVI
THE GREAT OSAKA THEATRE
On one of the vast canals that cut the city of Osaka in all directions, the theatre unfurls its wide façade, topped by two roofs. You can get to the show by boat; you can also walk or take a norimono, as a quay, paved with grey flagstones, stretches out in front of the building and separates it from the canal.
Two gigantic blue silk banners, covered in Chinese characters, hang from poles at each corner of the façade, far above the roofs of the building. The main scenes of the plays to be performed are painted with unprecedented richness of colour on large boards with gold backgrounds. We see warriors, princesses, gods and demons in the most exaggerated poses. Often the paint is replaced by a combination of fabrics, laid out in relief in velvet, crepe or satin, which represent the characters' clothes and produce the most brilliant effect. Huge lanterns, round on the ground floor and square on the upper floor, hang from criss-crossing red beams under the roofs. On the crest of the roof, a fantastic animal, dog or lion, strides towards the façade, opening its wide mouth and bristling its tail and mane.
From eight o'clock in the morning, the hour of the dragon, crowds would gather in front of the façade of the Grand-Théâtre. Those who had no hope of getting in at least wanted to enjoy the brilliant spectacle of the arrival of the wealthy individuals and elegant women.
On either side of the main door, reached by a wide staircase, were high platforms on which several delegates of the actors of the troupe came forward, dressed in street clothes, fans in hand. In a pompous style, with delightful gestures and grimaces, they praised to the audience the plays that were about to be performed, the splendour of the costumes and the staging, and the incomparable merit of the actors; then, when this subject was exhausted, they amused the crowd with all sorts of jokes, quips and anecdotes spouted with comic gravity and accompanied by the perpetual movement of the fan, handled in a skilful and graceful manner.
Soon the privileged public, who had been able to reserve seats in advance, arrived from all sides. On the two bridges that curve over the canal to the right and left of the theatre, the norimonos and cangos move forward at the steady pace of the porters, one after the other; other palanquins emerge from all the streets. The black lacquer gleams in the sunlight, and the women's toilettes, hastening to enter, have the fresh radiance of flowers in bloom.
A few young men arrived on horseback; they threw the bridle to the valet who had been running ahead of them, and quickly climbed the stairs to the theatre. Sheltered under large parasols, several families were advancing on foot. On the canal, a crowd of boats besieged the landing stage, the boatmen exchanged insults, and the women put their feet on the ground with frightened cries. They were followed by servants carrying magnificent chests of carved ivory, mother-of-pearl and sandalwood.
The auditorium was soon filled and the doors closed.
Inside, the theatre is shaped like a long square. The floor is divided by low partitions into a series of equal compartments: there are no paths to these sort of lockers, and it is on the crest of these small wooden walls, wide enough for you to put both feet on, that you venture to reach the compartment reserved for you. The journey was not without its perils, and was accompanied by shouts and bursts of laughter. The women, embarrassed in their beautiful clothes, moved forward cautiously, sometimes stumbling, as the men held out their arms to make them jump into the compartments. Some prefer to sit on the partition and let themselves slide. Each locker can hold eight people; they squat on the floor on a mat and, as soon as they are settled, a servant, attached to the theatre, brings them tea, sake, a small brazier and pipes on a lacquer tray.
Above the parterre, two rows of boxes extend along three sides of the auditorium, the fourth side being occupied by the stage. These boxes, richly decorated with gilding and paintings on red or black lacquer backgrounds, are the most sought-after seats in the theatre, especially those on the upper floor. It is here that the most elegant coquettes display the magnificence of their toilette. The view of the auditorium is a feast for the eyes; most of the women are charming with their matte white complexions, their glossy hair and their dark eyes; the shimmer of the silk, the brilliant breaks of the satin, the brilliance of the colours and the embroidery form a joyful and superb whole. Married women are easily recognisable by their teeth blackened by a mixture of iron filings and sake, their eyebrows plucked and the belt of their dress tied in a huge knot on their stomachs. Young girls tie the knot on their loins and leave their teeth their natural whiteness. They also wear their hair differently. Instead of letting their hair hang down in a long twist or gathering it into a single mass at the top of the head, they raise it on the forehead, arrange it like wings on either side of the face and form a complicated, voluminous bun. Here's a woman who has replaced the tortoiseshell pins that usually go through all hairstyles with pins that are no less long, but made of chiselled gold. Her neighbours prefer to adorn their hair only with flowers and silk cords.
The men are no less adorned than the women; crepe, brocade and velvet are not forbidden to them; some wear an embroidered scarf over their shoulder, with one end hanging down from the front; the longer the scarf, the higher the rank of the person wearing it; when greeting a superior, he must bow until the scarf touches the ground, so the longer it is, the less he bows. Several lords, protected by their incognito, their faces hidden in a black crepe bonnet that only let them see their eyes, filled the boxes on the first floor; but one of them, very close to the stage, remained empty; it opened suddenly and a woman appeared.
The audience gasped as they recognised Yodogimi. Was this possible? The mother of the siogoun openly entering a theatre! Had she lost all respect for custom, propriety and herself? The light gauze veil, which clung to the large pins of her headdress and passed over her face, if it indicated an intention to remain incognito, in no way masked the princess: she had been recognised at first glance. However, astonishment soon gave way to admiration. People were grateful that she had not hidden her charming face, which the thin veil made even more beautiful. The fabric of her dress was pale gold, covered with fine pearls and grains of crystal; it looked as if stars were trapped in the folds of the fabric. The princess smiled as she saw how quickly her initial displeasure had been overcome by admiration. She sat down slowly, and when she was seated, a masked warrior could be seen standing behind her.
But there were vague shivers of gongs, a few rolls of flute, a few muffled blows on the tambourines. The musicians were taking up their instruments, so we were about to begin.
The audience turned towards the stage, which was enclosed by a canvas covered in rhombuses, and in the centre of which appeared, on a red disc, a gigantic Chinese character: this was the name of the Snoring Top, the famous actor who had no equal. A wealthy silk merchant had dedicated this painting to him; it was not to be replaced until the day the Snoring Top either surpassed or surpassed him.
It was to be replaced only on the day when the Snoring Top was surpassed or equalled by one of his colleagues.
The curtain billowed, and a man, lifting it slightly, stepped out from underneath. As soon as he appeared, the hubbub that had filled the room ceased abruptly. The man greeted the audience with all sorts of pretences. He was dressed like a rich lord and held a roll of paper in his hands, which he began to unroll.
People waited in deep silence for his words. However, they all knew that no one would be able to make out what he was saying, because that was his mission: to speak without being understood. If anyone discovers anything about the true meaning of what he reads on his scroll, he has missed his goal. However, he must read the text exactly, without skipping a word, without adding anything.
This script contains a summary of the play that is about to be performed, the names of the characters, the actors and the places where the action takes place.
The announcer, by cutting words and phrases, stopping where he shouldn't, joining what should be separated, completely disfigures the text, creating misunderstandings and producing buffoonish phrases that make the audience laugh out loud.
Nevertheless, the audience listens, trying to reconstruct the true meaning. But the announcer is clever: he withdraws before we can find out what it's all about.
When he has disappeared, great music is heard behind the stage and the curtain rises.
The scene is an elegant bedroom, with a large window opening onto a landscape. Rich screens and a bed - a velvet mattress and cushions - furnish the room.
The audience immediately recognised the setting of one of the most popular plays in the repertoire.
It's the third act of The Vampire," murmurs everyone.
A young lord appears on the stage. He is sad, overwhelmed by remorse. He has yielded to the seductions of an enchantress who has pursued him, but he has allowed himself to be overcome only by the power of magic; he loves a young woman he has just married, but he has made himself unworthy of her; he trembles to see her again.
Here she comes, bent over.
- My dear husband!" she says, after a few days of marriage, "is this how you desert me?
The husband protests his fidelity, but pushes her away when she wants to throw herself into his arms. By dint of tears and prayers, the young woman finally moved him, he pressed her to his heart and they both fell onto the bed; Her hair fluttered on her shoulders, her eyes flashed with lightning, she was terribly beautiful, her dance was enchanting; she made mysterious signs, accompanied by strange, interrupted music; the two spouses trembled with all their limbs; she tore the woman from the young man's arms and drew him towards her. His teeth clashed, his knees collided and he fell to the ground unconscious. Then the vampire rushes over him and bites him on the neck; she sucks his blood with delight, only interrupting herself to express her joy by dancing wildly.
Finally, with a long dagger, she splits the young man's chest and eats his heart.
The audience expresses its emotion with a long murmur and the canvas falls.
Only this act of The Vampire was performed; it is the best, the most dramatic. Later, the young lord is resurrected and returned to his wife.
During the intermission, most of the audience leaves the auditorium and invades the teahouse adjoining the theatre. They are served their morning meal, or simply hot drinks and sweets, amid indescribable noise and confusion. Everyone shares their impressions of the merits of the play they have just seen, and of the acting of the actors; they imitate their gestures, their cries, their contortions; some try their hand at somersaults and capersaults, to the great hilarity of those present; others play chess, dice or mourre.
The intermission was long. The young boys who played the women in the first play will appear again in the second, and we have to give them time to rest, take a bath and put on their new costumes. But the time passed pleasantly: people ate, smoked, laughed, and soon returned to the theatre in an uproar.
The appearance of the auditorium had been completely transformed: all the women in the dressing rooms had changed their clothes, and the ones they were wearing were even more luxurious than the first.
All eyes turn to Yodogimi. One wonders what she could have thought up to make her second outfit worthy of the one that had dazzled the spectators just a moment before. This time, too, we are speechless with surprise. Her dress is entirely covered in the feathers of hummingbirds, firebirds and hummingbirds; she casts multicoloured glints of sapphires, rubies, emeralds and glowing embers. A carnage of these living jewels was made to cover the size of this dress: it cost the price of a castle.
The announcer reappeared; he made a speech no less mysterious than the first one, and the canvas was lifted.
This time it depicts a scene from the Onono-Komati-Ki.
Onono-Komati was a beautiful young girl attached to the court of Kioto. Passionate about poetry, she devoted herself to serious study and composed verses; but in her love for perfection, once she had written a poem she would wash it out and start again. Young men fell in love with her beauty and obsessed her with their pursuit. She spurned them and continued her favourite studies, but the spurned lovers did not forgive her her disdain; with perfidious slander they brought her down in disgrace. The inspired young woman left the palace and set off on her adventures. Little by little she became miserable, but her love of poetry did not diminish; she contemplated the beauties of nature and sang them with a rare perfection of style. As she grew older, her hair turned white; she was in the most complete destitution, wandering from village to village, leaning on a stick, a basket in her arm, containing her poems and a little rice; she lived on alms. Children would gather around her when she sat on the threshold of a temple; she would smile gently at them and teach them verses. Sometimes a monk would respectfully ask her permission to copy one of the pieces in her basket. The sweetly inspired woman died; only then did the hatred fall silent and her glory shine forth. She was deified and remembered by all.
After performing a few fragments of the play depicting the life of Onono-Komati, a burlesque interlude was performed.
The scene takes place in a public bath, and according to custom, the men and women, completely naked, bathe together, telling each other all sorts of comic anecdotes and doing a thousand crazy things. One day, a pregnant woman comes along, starts crying out in pain, and finally gives birth to a fat boy. The bathers welcome the birth with a frenzied dance.
At last, the Taïko-Ki began.
The canvas rises over a vast decoration representing an encampment of soldiers. The chief's tent stands taller than the others in the centre.
Envoys arrived, all in a daze, making great gestures with their arms and legs.
- We want to see him right now!
they shouted.
Then the curtains of the tent opened and Taïko appeared.
Nariko-Ma had succeeded in reproducing exactly the attitude and costume of the hero he was representing. The audience expressed its satisfaction. Those who had seen the illustrious Siogun in their youth thought they were seeing him again.
- What do they want with me? says Taïko.
The emissaries no longer dared to speak.
- Well!" said Taïko, frowning and putting his hand on his sabre.
- While you are fighting the enemies of the country, Mitsou-
Fidé, to whom you entrusted your leadership of the kingdom, has seized power.
At this news, Taïko's face went from surprise to worry to fury.
A man, holding a light hanging from the end of a horizontal wooden rod, brought it close to the actor's face, so that the audience would not lose any of the play of his physiognomy.
- Let's go! let's go!" he cried, "my presence alone can restore order in the palace.
He entrusts the command of his troops to one of his generals, and leaves the stage along a path that crosses the parterre and is lost in the folds of a drapery.
The stage swivels round to reveal the interior of a pagoda.
Taiko enters. He asks to rest and spend the night in the pagoda. He is told that Mitsou-Fidé has just arrived with his wife and mother. They are travelling and have stopped here.
Taïko leaps back.
- My enemy so close to me! Should I flee? No, I must disguise myself.
He got himself a razor, shaved his head completely and put on a monk's robe. No sooner had he stapled it on than Mitsou-
Fidé stepped forward and cast a wary glance at Taïko; the latter, to give himself the air of being at ease and unconcerned, began to sing a naive song popular throughout the kingdom:
- From the top of the mountain, I look down into the valley.
"The cucumbers and aubergines, the hope of the harvest, are in flower.
- Come here, monk," says Mitsou-Fidé. My mother is tired from the journey and needs a bath.
- Who'd have thought I'd come here to be a bath boy!
exclaims Taïko, turning round to face the audience with a most successful facial expression. I obey," he adds loudly.
The bathroom is only separated from the bedroom that fills the stage by a frame covered in oiled paper. Taïko prepares the bath while amusing the audience with a thousand strange reactions, accompanied by appropriate grimaces.
Mitsou-Fidé's mother enters the stage and asks if the bath is ready. When the fake monk answers in the affirmative, she disappears behind the frame. But Mitsou-Fidé has just learnt that Taïko is in the pagoda, and arrives furious, shouting where his enemy is.
- He's in the bath at the moment," says a monk.
- He won't escape me.
During this scene, Taïko slips away.
Mitsou-Fidé cut a long stalk of bamboo in the garden, sharpened the tip and hardened it over the fire of a bronze stove. Then, walking towards the frame that enclosed the bathroom, he pierced the paper with this improvised spear and, thinking he had killed his enemy, killed his mother.
- What have I done!" he cried out in horror as he heard a woman's scream.
- You have killed your mother!" said the young wife of Mitsou-Fidé, who entered pale with horror and trembling.
Repent! Repent as she expires," she cried in song.
"This cruel death caused by your hand is heaven's vengeance.
"Did I not tell you: beware of betraying your master? You have usurped power.
"See where ambition has led you. You have killed your mother; at least repent while she is dying".
- Alas! alas! screams the parricide, let us leave these cursed places, let us flee; remorse tears at my heart. For three days I have possessed the power, the punishment is terrible, my mother killed by my hand, I cannot believe it!
He rushes into the bathroom and comes out with all the signs of despair bordering on madness.
The scene rotates once more to show a field. Taïko in war costume, surrounded by soldiers, waits for his enemy who wants to flee. Mitsou-Fidé crosses the stage with a small retinue; he is surrounded by Taïko's men.
After a long speech in which he reproaches his unworthy servant, Taïko has him put in chains and taken prisoner.
The canvas falls away; the play is finished.
The audience was very interested: in certain situations they found analogies with the events that had just troubled the country; they often thought of Hiéyas as Mitsou-Fidé.
Everyone left very satisfied.
Not everyone. Fidé-Yori is dead at heart.
The young girl was not at the performance. Nagato tries in vain to console his friend.
- I'll never see her again! he cried. I had hoped that I would at last be able to live happily ever after, but misfortune has set its sights on me. Well, friend," he added, "I feel like dying. My mother's behaviour, her ruinous and mad luxury, on public display, fill my heart with bitterness. Several times, on hearing the outbursts from the soldier she has the weakness to love, I've been on the verge of jumping into that dressing room, punching him in the face and chasing her away with the anger that such a lapse in decorum deserves. And then my rage fell at the thought of love that invaded me. I hoped she would come, the young girl who is all my hope; I searched the room with an avid gaze.
But she didn't come! All is over, all is sadness in my mind, and this life that she has kept for me, I would like to free myself of it now!
XXVII
OMITI
Winter has come. Scorching days are succeeded by icy ones. The sky, the colour of ashes, seems to have changed roles with the earth, dazzling white in its snowy garment.
Near the outskirts of Osaka, the deserted beach has kept intact the thick cotton wool that has fallen from the sky. The waves, reflecting the dull clouds, look like ink. A few rocks stand here and there, torn snow clinging to the rough edges of their walls. Seagulls, thwarted in their flight by the wind, flap their wings; they look grey and dirty against this whiteness.
The last house in the suburb stretches out along the beach, the high palisade of its garden; it is all covered in snow, and the cross sign hanging from the top of the two posts flanking the door is illegible. The large lanterns on either side of the entrance have been drawn back and secured with a hook; a small awning protects them. The triple roofs of the dwelling appear to be covered with silver thatch.
This building is the tea house of the Rising Sun. This is where Omiti has been suffering her cruel fate for many long days. She suffers, but silently, with a proud resignation that accepts neither consolation nor pity. She has sacrificed herself to save the master of the kingdom, and submits to the consequences of that sacrifice without a murmur. Only she sometimes thinks that it would have been more merciful to kill her. She has no desire to see the king again, even though she loves him all the same. Her love was born of a young girl's reverie. Before she had ever seen Fide-Yori, this young prince, said to be charming and full of gentleness, crossed her dreams, and during the day, while embroidering, she thought of him. When she overheard the horrible plot that threatened the life of the man who filled her thoughts, she thought she would die of fright, but the desire to save him had given her the energy and courage of a hero. In her only meeting with the king, near the lemon grove, she had understood that her heart had not been deceived and that she would never love anyone but him.
But the idea that he might love her had not even occurred to her, her modesty had pushed it aside, and since, sold for the pleasure of all, she had fallen to the lowest rank in society, the thought of appearing before Fide-Yori again made her ashamed.
Rich merchants from the city often brought their wives to the teahouse to spend a few hours in the company of the courtesans. The courtesans would teach them manners, the art of playing the semsin and composing verses. Sometimes the woman of the world, crouched opposite Omiti, listening with half-opened lips to the painful song of the young girl, had been surprised to see tears suddenly welling up in the singer's eyes, but she had thought that this was a seductive ruse, and, going home, had tried to cry by making the strings of her instrument vibrate.
Under its blanket of snow, behind the closed windows, and although it appeared silent from the outside, the teahouse was full of people and bustle.
For several weeks now, it had been invaded daily by a crowd of people from all walks of life, who seemed to gather there for some secret purpose. The master of the establishment was undoubtedly in agreement with these men; he always interfered in their conversation; he even often seemed to direct it and inflame it. They talked about the country's affairs: the misery was terrible; this civil war, occurring at a time when the fields needed man's care the most, had damaged the harvests; several had been completely destroyed by the armies, the others had been bad; a famine threatened the whole part of the kingdom that still belonged to Fidé-Yori. The north, on the other hand, had been preserved and was flourishing. While rice was in short supply around Osaka, it was sold at half the normal price in the northern provinces, but Hiéyas was absolutely opposed to exporting it to the south. The siogoun did not bother to bring it from elsewhere. While the people were starving, the court displayed unparalleled luxury: every day there were receptions, parties and banquets. Yodogimi aroused popular indignation; she drained the treasury. Taxes had been raised and salaries cut. Obviously, this was madness. The court, dragging after it streams of gold and satin, to the sound of dizzying music, was running, dancing, towards an abyss. Everyone was blinded; no one thought about the possible resumption of the war; they got drunk, laughed and sang between the fallen walls of the fortress; no one bothered to put the army back on its feet, to increase it if possible. Yoké-Moura had tried in vain to take action; he lacked money; the follies and ruinous finery of Princess Yodogimi absorbed everything. And what was the Siogun doing? Plunged into an inexplicable sadness, he wandered alone in the gardens, taking no interest in anything, abandoning power, so to speak. It was obvious that Hiéyas was only waiting for an opportunity to give the final blow to this crumbling edifice. But why wait? Did not the wisdom of the old man contrast with the short-sightedness of the young man and the folly of his court? It was time to call Hiéyas: his accession would save the people from misery and possible starvation; why allow themselves to be reduced to the last extremity? We had to try to bring about the inevitable outcome as quickly as possible.
Omiti, with growing dread, heard daily speeches similar to this one. It was not always the same men who returned; they went elsewhere to foment revolt and stir up anger. Emissaries from Hiéyas were obviously mixed up with these craftsmen. The usurper saw the value of a movement in his favour in Osaka; he wanted to provoke it. Moreover, the insouciance of the court supported him wonderfully. Omiti understood all this; she twisted her arms and wept in despair.
- No one has the courage to warn him of the danger!
she cried in her sleepless nights.
One day, as she was embroidering in her room, she noticed that those talking in the room below were lowering their voices.
Usually they didn't care if they were heard. Her heart leapt in her chest.
- I absolutely must hear what they're saying," she murmured.
she whispered.
She walked to the edge of the staircase and took hold of the banister, sliding down as lightly as a cloth.
The conversation had started and she caught bits of it.
- Yes, this beach is deserted.
- You enter the inn through the door facing the sea.
- And we'd leave in small groups on the street side.
- The soldiers would have to be disguised as craftsmen.
- Of course, but they should keep their weapons under their clothes.
- The town is already very agitated, we would march en masse to the fortress, and we would demand that the Siogun relinquish power.
- If he refuses, we will invade the palace and seize his person.
Omiti shuddered with horror.
- I absolutely must get out of here and raise the alarm," she murmured.
The conspirators continued:
- We must hurry, tomorrow, at nightfall, the soldiers will be able to disembark.
- Immediately afterwards, a cargo of rice and wheat will arrive.
Omiti went back to her room; she knew enough, her mind was made up. A sort of mystical ardour filled her spirit.
- My mission in this world is to save him, to keep him on the brink of the abyss," she said to herself with exaltation. This is the second time my ear has caught a criminal secret, a plot against the man I loved before I met him. Heaven's will is showing itself in this: this time too, I must warn him of the danger, and my feeble hand will stop the crime from being carried out.
She thought about the means she could use to escape from the inn.
Two other young women shared her room at night, but she could not confide in them, as they did not love her and were all devoted to the master.
On the ground floor, all the doors were locked from the inside with heavy bars; moreover, the valets in charge of the cellar slept downstairs. So there was no need to think about escaping from this side. There was still the window; the first floor was quite high, but that wasn't what worried Omiti. How could she slide the window shutter open without waking the young women? If she did it quietly, the cold air entering the room would rouse them from their sleep. Omiti thought of the window that opened onto the landing of the staircase; but the one in the bedroom looked out onto the street, whereas this one looked out onto the garden, and once in the garden there was still the palisade to cross.
- Anyway," Omiti said to herself, "I'll go down by the window of the staircase.
But how? She didn't have a ladder at her disposal.
With a rope! Where would she get a rope without arousing suspicion? She decided to make one. Her companions had gone for a walk and she had some time to spare. Opening the chests containing her clothes, she pulled out some strong silk dresses and cut them into strips. She then plaited the strips together and tied the braids with strong knots. Then she rolled up the rope and hid it under her mattress.
- Now," she said, "I'm sure I can save him.
The day seemed long to her, and the fever of waiting gave her a nervous tremor, and she chattered her teeth from time to time.
The girls came back with their cheeks all rosy with cold; they tired Omiti by recounting everything they had seen and done; they had gone as far as the banks of the Yodo-Gava to see if it was carrying ice cubes. They thought they could make out a few, but perhaps it was just floating snow; besides, there was snow everywhere, even on the golden fish in the high tower of the fortress, which had become silver fish; the breeze was icy cold; but, to protect themselves from the cold, the men had invented embroidered velvet earflaps...
Omiti was not listening to the endless cackling of the young women. She was pleased to see the lanterns being lit. Night was coming on, but the evening would still be long. She couldn't eat anything at the evening meal, and said she was sick so she didn't have to sing or play the biva.
She went back up to her room. Her companions soon joined her there; the walk had tired them, and they promptly fell asleep.
The noise, the laughter and the songs of the men getting drunk in the rooms below continued for a long time, and finally she heard the familiar crash of the bars falling into the hooks, everyone had left.
She waited another half hour to give the valets time to fall asleep, then without making the slightest noise she got up, took her rope from under the mattress and moved the panel that opened onto the staircase a little.
She listened and heard nothing more than a few snores, but that noise was reassuring. She opened the window and shivered in the night air. She leaned out and looked down; the white snow cast a vague light.
- It's a long way up! she thought, but will my rope be long enough?
She tied it to the windowsill and let it unwind. The rope reached the ground and even dragged a little on the snow.
Omiti wrapped her dress around her legs and knelt down on the windowsill, but as she was about to let go of the frail rope, a sort of instinctive fear overcame her and she hesitated.
- How!" she said, "I tremble for my life when his is in danger!
She let herself go abruptly, holding on to the rope with both hands. A sharp pain almost made her scream: it seemed as if her arms were going to be torn from her shoulders; her hands were scraping as they slid against the rope; she was descending rapidly. But suddenly one of the knots in the silk stretched under her weight and the rope snapped.
She fell into the snow, her body making a hole in the snow that almost swallowed her whole. But the fall had been cushioned and Omiti stood up, feeling no pain apart from a sudden weariness. After shaking off the snow that covered her whole body, she crossed the garden and reached the palisade. Luckily, the gate was only closed by a large round bolt; after some effort, Omiti managed to pull it.
She was on the beach, out of that dreadful house, free at last! The violent wind from the sea, whose monotonous roar she could hear, hit her in the face. She began to run, sinking ankle-deep into the thick layer of snow, kicking it up into the dust.
She was in such a hurry to get away from the inn that instead of turning the corner of the house and taking the street on which the façade opened, she followed the garden fence, which soon disappeared and was replaced by a wall bordering another enclosure.
- I'll enter the city by the next alley that opens onto the beach, Omiti thought.
She reached a sort of crossroads, open on the seaward side, bordered on the other by a semi-circle of miserable huts, which she could make out confusedly beneath their snowy bonnets.
In the centre, hanging from a post, a lighted lantern made a bloody spot that shook. The light was poor. The young girl took a few steps into the crossroads, but suddenly recoiled with a cry of horror; she had just seen a frightening face staring at her from beneath the lantern.
The young girl's scream was answered by the cries of countless ravens, which, suddenly awakened, took to the skies and began to circle incoherently.
Omiti was enveloped in this sinister flight. Immobile with terror, she thought she was the prey of an hallucination, and opened her eyes wide, trying to understand what she was seeing. The face was still staring at her, with snow in its eyebrows and on its hair, its mouth open and its eyes haggard. At first Omiti thought she saw a man leaning against a post, but on closer inspection she saw that the head, which had no body, was hanging by its hair from a nail.
Omiti recognised that she was in the crossroads of capital executions.
The ground was lumpy with hastily dug graves in which the victims were buried. The body of the last victim had been left at the foot of the post; a dog, busy removing the shroud of snow covering the corpse, let out a long howl and ran off carrying a bloody shred.
A large bronze statue of Buddha seated on a lotus appeared, stained with a few white flakes.
Omiti overcame her terror and crossed the crossroads, stretching out her arms to ward off the swarm of frantic crows that swooped down on her. They pursued her with their mournful cries, which mingled with the moans of the sea.
The young girl quickly made her way down a narrow street where there was no light. The snow had been trampled underfoot and she was now walking through icy mud.
The darkness was deep, no longer illuminated by the whiteness of the ground. Omiti walked along the walls, trying to lean against them, but the houses were not evenly spaced; there were gaps and she sometimes lacked the support she needed. Her feet sank into potholes of soft snow that was beginning to melt in places. She would fall, then get up again; the bottom of her dress was soaked. She felt freezing cold.
- Will I get where I'm going? she thought.
Another street came into view, intersecting the first; a few lights shone on it. Omiti turned into this street.
Without realising it, the young girl was passing through the most despicable part of the capital. Thieves, women of ill repute and scoundrels of all kinds haunt and inhabit it. There is also a particular kind of man: the Lonines. These are young men, sometimes of noble birth, driven to the lowest degree of ignominy by debauchery. Driven from their families or stripped of their jobs, but retaining the right to carry two swords, they take refuge among the reprobates, indulge in all sorts of shameful industries, murder on behalf of others, lead gangs and wield great power in the midst of this horde of wretches. A few hours earlier, it would have been impossible for the young girl to cross this district without being assaulted, insulted and dragged by force into one of the bad places that make it up. Fortunately, it was late at night and the streets were deserted.
But there was another obstacle in Omiti's way: the neighbourhood was closed off by a fence, which a man was guarding. How could the gate be opened at such an hour? What pretext could he give the guard, who was suspicious and probably off-putting? Omiti thought about this as she walked.
Soon, at the end of a street, she saw the wooden gate illuminated by several lanterns; she saw the hut made of planks that sheltered the guard.
- If I show the slightest concern, he will not trust me.
She walked straight to the door. The man was no doubt asleep, because the noise she made as she stepped forward did not attract him outside. Omiti measured the barrier with her eyes. It was impossible to get through; a portcullis of criss-crossed iron rods stood above it.
With a flutter of her heart, the young girl went to knock against the boards of the hut.
The guard came out with a lantern. He was well wrapped up in a wadded-up robe, and his head disappeared under the wrappings of a brown woollen cloth; he looked sickly and stupefied by drunkenness.
- What's the matter?" he said hoarsely, raising his lantern to Omiti's face.
- Open the door for me," said the young girl.
The guard burst out laughing.
- You've lost your mind," he cried.
And he turned on his heels.
- Listen," she said, holding him by his dress, "my father is ill and has sent me for the doctor.
- Well, there's no shortage of doctors in the neighbourhood, there's one ten paces from here, there's another in the rue de la Cigale-d'Automne, and a third at the corner of the sentier des Maraudeurs.
- But my father only trusts one who lives in the next district.
- Go home and sleep well," said the man; "you're telling me a lie, but I'm not easy to fool.
He was about to close the entrance to the hut.
- Let me out," cried Omiti in despair, "and I swear you'll be rewarded beyond your expectations.
- Do you have any money?" said the guard, turning round sharply.
Omiti remembered that she had a few kobangs in her belt.
- Yes," she said.
- Why didn't you say so straight away?
He took the big key hanging from his belt and approached the door. Omiti gave him a kobang. It was a large sum for a man who was paid very little and who, moreover, drank up all his pay.
- With a reason like that in your hands, you didn't need to put your father to death! he said as he opened the door.
- Which is the shortest route to the banks of the Yodo-Gava?
- Walk straight ahead. You'll find a new barrier. It opens onto the shore.
- Thank you," she said.
And she walked quickly away. The path was better; the snow had been piled up in large mounds.
- I'm saved now," said the young girl to herself, joyful and oblivious to the fatigue that was weighing her down.
She reached the second barrier. But this time she knew how to get the gate to open. The guard was walking up and down, stamping his feet to keep warm.
- A kobang for you if you open the door for me! she shouted.
The man held out his hand and put the key in the lock. Omiti passed by; she was on the banks of the River Neuve. Now all she had to do was go back up to the castle. There was still a long way to go, but there were no obstacles. She walked bravely, clutching her dress to her chest to keep out the cold.
Night watchmen passed by on the other shore, beating tambourines to announce the last watch of the night. When the young girl reached the castle, a pale, dull day was trying to pierce through the clouds; the snow was back to its brilliant bluish whiteness, seeming to give off light rather than receive it from the dark sky, which seemed to be covered in red smoke.
The castle towered imposingly above her. The tall towers rose into the sky, the broad roofs of the princely pavilions were spread out, and the cedars along the first terrace had heaped up bundles of snow on their still-green branches, fragments of which occasionally broke off and tumbled from branch to branch.
Omiti felt tears welling up in her eyes as she saw the walls destroyed and the ditches filled in.
- My poor beloved prince," she said to herself, "you have given yourself over to your enemy; if the war started again you would be lost; at least you will still escape the odious plot hatched against you!
Everything in the castle was asleep, apart from the numerous sentries who came and went; the fallen walls had been replaced by living ones.
Omiti, as he reached his goal, feared he would not have the strength to take the few remaining steps to reach the fortress gate. Drenched in snow, shattered by fatigue and emotion, the icy chill of the morning made her tremble from head to toe; everything swayed before her eyes, her temples pounded and her ears buzzed. She hurried towards the door.
The sentries crossed their spears in front of her.
- You can't go through," they said.
- Yes, I must go at once and see the king, or you'll be severely punished!
The soldiers shrugged their shoulders.
- Get back, woman! You're drunk or mad, go away!
- I beg you, let me in; call someone, I think I'm going to die; but first I must speak to the king! I must, do you hear? Don't let me die without speaking.
Her voice was so painful and pleading that the soldiers were moved.
- What's the matter with her?" said one, "she's as pale as snow; she could well die as she says.
- What if she has something to reveal?
- Let's take her to the Prince of Nagato; he'll decide whether to listen to her.
- Come in," said one of the soldiers, "we feel sorry for you.
Omiti staggered a few steps, but her strength failed her. She hurriedly grabbed a dried flower from her chest and held it out to the soldiers; then, with a muffled cry, she fell backwards.
The worried and embarrassed soldiers looked at each other.
- If she's dead," said one, "we'll be accused of killing her.
- We'd better throw her in the river.
- Yes, but how can we touch a corpse without becoming impure?
- We'll purify ourselves according to the prescribed laws, and that's better than letting our heads be cut off.
- True enough. Let's make haste. It's a shame," added the soldier, leaning towards Omiti; "but it's her fault too, why did she have to die like that?
Just as they were about to lift her up and carry her to the river, a clear young voice burst out singing a song:
"Is there anything in the world more precious than sake?
"If I were not a man, I would like to be a barrel!
The soldiers jumped to their feet. A young boy came forward, wrapped in a fur-trimmed robe, his head buried in a bonnet tied under his chin. He proudly rested his velvet-gloved hand on the handles of his sabres.
It was Loo returning from a night party, alone and on foot so as not to be denounced by his retinue to the Prince of Nagato, for Loo had had a retinue ever since he became a samurai.
- What's going on? Who is this woman lying motionless on the snow?" he cried, turning a terrible gaze from one soldier to another.
The soldiers fell to their knees.
- Lord," they said, "we are not guilty. She wanted to enter the castle to speak to the Siogun; moved by her prayers, we were going to let her pass and have her taken to the illustrious Prince of Nagato, when all of a sudden she fell dead.
Loo leaned towards the young girl.
- Donkeys! empty brains! milk drinkers! collapsed shoes!" he cried angrily, "can't you see that she's breathing, that she's only fainted! You leave her in the snow instead of helping her. To cure you of your stupidity, I'll have you caned and left dead in the square.
The soldiers were shaking all over.
- Come on," said Loo, "lift her carefully and follow me.
me.
The soldiers obeyed. When they had passed through the gate of the fortress, the young samurai went to knock on the guardhouse a few steps away.
- Renew the sentries," he shouted, "I need them.
I need them.
And he continued on his way. The Prince of Nagato was asleep. Loo didn't hesitate to go and wake him up. He knew that the Siogun was trying to retrace the steps of a young girl he loved. He and his master had followed the king as he searched the city. The woman he had just seen, fainting at the castle gate, closely resembled the portrait drawn by Fidé-Yori.
- Master," he said to the prince, who was still awake and looking at the child with a weary, surprised gaze, "I think I've found what the Siogun is looking for.
- Omiti!" exclaimed Nagato, "where did you find it?
- In the snow! But come quickly, she's cold and motionless, we mustn't let her die.
The prince put on a fur-lined robe and ran to the room where Omiti had been laid.
- This could well be the one we were looking for," he said when he saw her. But first, send for some maids and have them remove the girl's wet and muddy clothes. Call the palace doctor too.
Omiti was wrapped in the softest furs and the flames were rekindled in a large bronze basin. The king soon arrived. From the threshold of the room, through the open panel, he saw the young girl in the midst of this heap of superb fabrics and fleeces. He let out a cry of joy and rushed towards her.
- Omiti!" he cried, "am I dreaming? It's you! After being separated for so long, you've finally been returned to me!
The young girl shuddered at the king's cry. She opened her eyes. The doctor arrived out of breath; he knelt down beside her and took her hand.
- It's nothing," he said, after feeling her pulse carefully, "just a minor fainting spell, no doubt brought on by the cold and fatigue.
Omiti, with her large, surprised eyes, shaded by long, fluttering eyelashes, looked at all the people grouped around her. She could see the king at her feet; standing next to her, the Prince of Nagato, whose handsome face smiled at her; then the grave face of the doctor, made strange by an enormous pair of spectacles. She thought she was in a dream.
- Are you suffering, my sweet beloved?" said Fidé-Yori, taking Omiti's little hand in hers. What's happened to you? Why are you so pale?
She looked at the king and listened to his words without understanding them. Suddenly the memory came back to her and she stood up abruptly.
- I must speak to the siogoun!" she cried to him alone, "at once!
With a gesture, Fidé-Yori dismissed those present; he held back the Prince of Nagato.
- You can speak in front of him, he's my dearest friend," he said.
But calm down; why do you look so frightened?
Omiti tried to gather her thoughts, clouded by fever.
- Here," she said. Through skilful emissaries, Hiéyas is inciting the people of Osaka to revolt, to hate the rightful lord. Soldiers disguised as craftsmen will disembark on the beach near the suburb; they will break into the city and come right up to your dismantled castle to demand that you abdicate your title or take your life if you refuse. You don't doubt my words, do you? Once already you have had proof, alas! that the misfortunes I am announcing are real.
- What!" cried Fide-Yori, her eyes wet with tears, "you have come to me again to save me. You are the good genius of my life.
- Hurry up and give orders, take measures to prevent the crimes that are being prepared," said Omiti, "time is running out: this evening, have you understood? the soldiers of Hiéyas are to treacherously invade your town.
Fidé-Yori turned to the Prince of Nagato.
- Ivakoura," he said, "what do you advise me to do?
- Warn General Yoké-Moura. Tell him to put his men under arms and keep an eye on the beach and the town. Isn't there a place where the leaders of the conspiracy should meet?" he added, addressing Omiti.
- There is," said the young girl, "it's the Rising Sun tea house.
- Well, we need to surround the inn and seize the agitators. Do you want me to carry out your orders, master?
- You will make me happy, friend, by doing so.
- I leave you, my lord," said Nagato, "worry about nothing, and give yourself over to the joy of having found the one you love.
The prince walked away.
- What does he mean?" thought Omiti in surprise, "the one you love", who is he talking about?
She was alone with the king and didn't dare look up. Her heart was beating violently. Fidé-Yori, too, was troubled; he did not speak, but gazed at the charming child trembling before him.
The young girl, blushing, was twirling a small dried-up branch in her fingers.
- What have you got in your hand?" asked the siogun softly; "is it a talisman?
- Don't you recognise the blossoming lemon branch that you gave me when I saw you?" she said. "Just now, when I fainted, I held it out to the sentries; I thought that they would bring it to you and that when you saw it you would remember me. But I found it in my hand.
- How did you keep these flowers?
Omiti looked up at the king with a beautiful gaze that showed his soul, then looked down again.
- Because you gave them to me," she said.
- So you love me?" cried Fidé-Yori.
- Oh, master," said the frightened young girl, "I would never have the audacity to confess the folly of my heart.
- You don't want to confess your love. Well, I love you with all my soul, and I dare to tell you so.
- You love me, you siogun!" she exclaimed with touching amazement.
- Yes, and for a long time, evil one, I've been waiting for you, I've been looking for you, I was plunged in despair, you made me suffer cruelly; but now that you're here, everything is forgotten.
Why did you wait so long? Weren't you thinking about me?
- You were my only thought, blooming like a divine flower in the midst of my painful life; without you I would have died.
- You thought of me while I moaned about your absence, and you didn't come?
- I didn't know that you deigned to keep my memory alive.
Besides, if I had, I wouldn't have come.
- How," cried the siogoun, "that's how you love me; you refuse to live with me, to be my wife!
- Your wife!" murmured Omiti with a sad smile.
- Certainly," said Fidé-Yori, "why this expression of bitterness on your face?
- It's because I'm not worthy to be just one of the maids in your palace, and when you find out what I've become, you'll chase me away in horror.
- What do you mean?" exclaimed the siogun, turning pale.
- Listen," said the young girl in a deaf voice. Hiéyas came to my father's castle; he knew that I had discovered the terrible plot against your life and that I had denounced it. There I lived as women who are slaves live. I didn't leave the teahouse until that night. Once again, I had overheard a plot against you. I escaped through the window, using a rope that broke. You're safe now, let me go; it's not right for you to stay any longer in the company of a woman like me.
- Shut up," cried Fide-Yori, "what you've just told me has broken my heart; but do you think I've stopped loving you? How! It's because of me that you were reduced to servitude, it's because of me that you suffered, you saved my life twice and you want me to abandon you, to despise you!
You are losing your mind. I love you more than ever. You will be queen, do you hear? How many women in your position have been bought and married by lords? You are here, you will never leave.
- O master!" cried Omiti, "I implore you, think of your rank, of what you owe to yourself, don't let yourself be carried away by a passing desire.
- Shut up! Cruel child," said the king, "I swear that if you make me despair like this, I'll kill myself at your feet.
Fidé-Yori had reached for her sword.
- Oh no, no!" cried the young girl, who turned very pale.
I'm your slave, you can have me.
- My beloved queen!" cried Fidé-Yori, wrapping her arms around her, "you are my equal, my companion, not my slave; it's not just out of obedience that you give in, is it?
- I love you!" murmured Omiti, raising her beautiful eyes wet with tears to the king.

FROM NOW ON MY HOUSE WILL BE QUIET
The ringleaders of the conspiracy had been arrested in the inn of the Rising Sun; but the soldiers of Hiéyas, warned in time, had not disembarked, so that, although it was certain that Hiéyas was the secret leader of the conspiracy, no evidence could be adduced against him. However, it was clear that the civil war was about to start again. General Yoké-Moura was of the opinion that it was necessary to take the initiative and bring the war to the enemy province. The other generals, on the other hand, wanted to gather all their forces around Osaka and wait.
Discord broke out between the chiefs.
- You are reckless," they said to Yoké-Moura.
- You are madmen," replied the general.
Nothing was decided. Fidé-Yori, completely content, did not want to hear about war.
- Let my generals do their job," he said.
However, at the request of the Prince of Nagato, he sent an old chief named Kiomassa, known for his prudence and devotion, to Hiéyas.
- Let him go to Mikava under the guise of peace," said the prince, "and let him try to find out if Hiéyas really wants to start the war again. The Mikado has ordered us to remain at peace; the first person to break his order will incur his wrath. If war is inevitable, let our enemy be the first to blame. Kiomassa has a castle in the vicinity of Mikava; he can visit Hiéyas from his estate without arousing suspicion.
General Kiomassa had left, taking three thousand men with him.
- I've come to see you as a neighbour," he said to Hiéyas when he reached Mikava castle.
Hiéyas greeted him with a mocking smile.
- I have always held you in high esteem," he said, "and it is a pleasure for me that chance has brought you to this side. This morning, on hearing of your arrival on my lands, I told the lords of my house that, apart from three things, I saw nothing to admire in you.
- And what are those three things?" said Kiomassa.
- Firstly, you are travelling with an army, which is unusual in times of peace; secondly, you have a fortress that seems to threaten my provinces; thirdly and finally, contrary to fashion, you are letting your beard grow under your chin.
Kiomassa replied without appearing angry:
- I travel with an army to protect myself from all danger, because I believe the roads to be unsafe; I have a fortress naturally to house this army. As for my beard, it's very useful: when I tie the cords of my helmet, it makes a little cushion under my chin and protects it from rubbing.
- Fine, keep your beard, but shave your castle," said Hiéyas, smiling; "your soldiers can help you with that.
- If you're that keen, I'll ask Fide-Yori if he'll allow me to give you the castle. I'm going back to my master. Don't you have anything to tell him?
- You can tell him I'm angry with him," says Hiéyas.
- And why is that?
- Because he had the characters that make up my name engraved on the bronze bell that he dedicated to Buddha's temple, and they are tapped night and morning.
- How!" cried Kiomassa, "Fide-Yori had these words engraved on the bell: From now on my house will be quiet.
- I'm telling you that all the characters in my name make up this phrase, and that it is on my name, cursing it, that the bronze mallet is struck.
- I'll let the siogun know that this coincidence hurts you," said Kiomassa, without losing any of his placidity.
- He returned to Osaka and recounted how he had been received by Hiéyas. The mocking insolence and futile quarrel imagined by the former regent sufficiently indicated the latter's hostile intentions, which he did not even try to disguise.
- This behaviour is tantamount to a declaration of war," said Fidé-Yori, "and we must consider it as such. However, let us not attack, let Hiéyas advance; he will not do so immediately.
We will no doubt have time to dig the ditches around the fortress; let's get to work straight away.
Some time later Fide-Yori repudiated his wife, the granddaughter of
daughter, and sent her back to her grandfather. At the same time he announced his forthcoming marriage to Omiti, to whom he had given the title of Princess of Yamato.
The two fiancés forgot the rest of the world; their joy blinded them to the dangers that threatened them. For them, the only possible misfortune was to be separated, and they were certain that if disaster struck, they could die together.
They had been to see the lemon grove again. Faint buds were beginning to dent the bushes, for spring comes quickly in this climate; as soon as the last snow has melted, the trees are already turning green. They wandered through the misty alleys of the gardens, hand in hand, enjoying the happiness of being close to each other, of seeing each other in ways other than in their thoughts or dreams, for they adored each other but did not know each other. They had only seen each other for a moment, and the image they had kept of each other in their memory was incomplete and a little different from reality. Every minute brought a new surprise.
- I thought you weren't so tall," said Fidé-Yori.
- Your eyes had seemed proud and contemptuous to me," said Omiti; "on the contrary, an infinite tenderness fills them.
- How sweet your voice is, my beloved!" said the king; "my memory has distorted its divine music.
Sometimes they got into a little boat and rowed out to the middle of the pond. On the shore, a tall willow tree let the long folds of its green draperies hang down towards the water, irises pierced the liquid mirror with their rough leaves, water lilies spread out on the surface. The two fiancés cast a line. The hook sank in a series of circles on the water. But no matter how hard the fish bit, no matter how wildly the light buoy on the surface of the pond danced, they took no notice; from one end of the boat to the other, they stared at each other passionately. Sometimes, however, they realised that the fish were taunting them, and their clear laughter broke out, mingling with the birdsong.
He was twenty-three, she eighteen.
But it was Omiti who sometimes worried about the war.
- Don't forget your royal duties towards me," she would say.
Don't forget that war threatens us.
- Your heart is at peace with mine," said Fidé-Yori; "why are you talking about war?
Besides, the siogun could safely absorb himself in his love. The Prince of Nagato took his place. He had organised the defence and had tried to bring the generals, who hated each other and thought only of antagonising each other, into agreement. Harounaga in particular gave him a thousand worries. He had forbidden his soldiers to work on digging the moat around the castle.
- That's slave labour," he said, "and you are warriors.
The soldiers of the other cohorts, not wanting to be less susceptible than their companions, refused to work in their turn. So after a month and a half, the children could still easily climb up and down the ditch.
Nagato was forced to impose severe penalties. Little by little, order was established.
Signénari set up camp on the plain to the north of the town.
Yoké-Moura set up camp on the hill called Yoka-Yama; Harounaga, on the hill called Tchaousi-Yama. The rest of the troops guarded the beach or were massed in the fortresses. Nagato had also instructed Raïden and his companions to enlist anyone who wanted to fight. The brave sailors had gathered ten thousand volunteers.
Defended in this way, the city was difficult to surprise. Nagato had his eye on everything, and fortified the two bastions at the entrance to Osaka on either side of the river. Using the canals that criss-cross the city and by demolishing a number of bridges, he had managed to form a moat and isolate the district that contained the fortress. The prince seemed indefatigable. With such a leader, who thought of everything and fired up the soldiers with his words and his example, the city could defend itself and still have hope. But suddenly Nagato left Osaka.
One evening a horseman stopped at the gate of his palace.
Nagato recognised Farou-So-Chan, one of the lords specially attached to the service of the Kisaki. It was never without a deep throbbing of the heart that Ivakura saw anyone coming from the Dairi. This time, his emotion was even more violent: Farou-So-Chan had been entrusted with a special, secret mission.
- Here is a letter that the Kisaki has asked me to give to you," he said with a sad gravity that struck Nagato.
He unfolded the letter with a tremor in his fingers; it exhaled the subtle perfume he loved so much.
It read as follows:
"On the tenth day of the fifth moon, go to the province of Issé, to the temple of Ten-Sio-Daï-Tsin, when evening comes, kneel at the threshold of the temple and remain in prayer until a young priest approaches you and touches your shoulder, then rise and follow him, he will lead you to me."
Nagato was lost in conjecture. What was the meaning of this strange meeting on the threshold of the temple of the Sun Goddess, in the province of Issé? Was it a trap? No, since Farou-So-
Chan was the messenger. But then he was going to see her again, and all anxiety disappeared in the face of this joy.
The tenth day of the fifth moon was the day after tomorrow.
The prince had only time to arrive at the appointed hour; he left in a hurry.
XXIX
THE HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE SUN
It is at Naikou, in the province of Issé, bathed by the waves of the Pacific Ocean, that the primitive temple of Ten-Sio-
Daï-Tsin. According to divine legends, the Sun Goddess was born on the very site of this temple.
Here, the ancient traditions, the confused legends of the first ages, are religiously preserved by the priests, who meditate on the profound meaning of the symbols.
In the mysterious times when the world was not yet a reality, the confused elements floated in space. What was once earth and what was once heaven were mixed together, just as the yolk and the white are mixed together in the embryonic egg.
But then three immaterial gods appeared: the Supreme God, the Creator of Souls, the Creator of Matter, and the chaotic state ceased. The heavy, opaque parts came together and formed the earth; the light, subtle parts rose and became the sky.
Soon, from the soft, silty mass that was the earth, a hairy, half-open flower rose from the floating mists, its corolla bearing the God of the Germinating Reeds. He watched over the newborn world for countless years. The Genie of the Waters came after him and reigned for a thousand million years.
During these immeasurable periods, the gods succeeded one another in the heavens. The seventh of the divine dynasties reigned in the ether.
One day, from the top of a bridge thrown between the clouds, the god Iza-
Na-Gui and his companion Iza-Na-Mi looked down on the earth.
- Everywhere I see only the immensity of water," said the god.
With the tip of his jewelled spear, he shook the surface of the sea, and the silt rose up, spread out over the water and came to rest there. This is how the first island of Japan was formed.
Soon it was covered with vegetation, populated by quadrupeds and birds and became so charming that Iza-Na-Gui and her companion descended from the sky and came to live there. The birds taught them love, and the Sun goddess was born. The divine couple went on to give birth to the genies of the wind, the rain, the metallic mountains, the Moon god who "looks through the night", and finally to the first men, whose descendants populated the island.
Then the creators of Japan ascended to heaven, entrusting the government of the world to their beloved daughter, the Sun goddess.
All the subjects of this luminous divinity must, at least once in their lives, make a pilgrimage to her temple at Naikou, in order to purify their souls. This is why the town is constantly crowded with pilgrims arriving and departing, some on horseback or by norimono, others - and these are the most deserving - on foot, carrying a straw mat to use as a bed and a long wooden spoon to draw water from the streams along the way.
The temple is of great simplicity, a small building, open on one side, topped with a broad thatched roof, surrounded by hundred-year-old cedars and preceded, some twenty paces away, by a Torié, the sacred portico, which consists of two high beams leaning slightly towards each other and joined at their ends by two crossbeams, the highest of which has its ends curved towards the sky. The temple houses only one large round mirror, made of polished metal, a symbol of clairvoyance and purity.
It was in front of this mirror, on the few wooden steps leading up to the temple, that the Prince of Nagato came to kneel, at the moment indicated by the Kisaki. It was already dark, the moon had risen, and its light, broken by the screen of high branches and foliage, fell to the ground. The priests had returned to the sumptuous pagodas that surround the rustic monument of the early ages; the pilgrims had gone away, and all that could be heard was the vague rustling of the cedars in the wind.
The prince listened attentively. Impressed despite himself by the sanctity of the place, he found the night strangely solemn. There was something threatening about the silence, the shadows of the cedars were hostile, the moon-blue gaze seemed to weep over him.
Why did an invincible anguish oppress his heart so? What was he going to learn? Why was the sovereign in Naikou instead of in her palace? A hundred times he asked himself the same question, which he could not answer.
At last, he felt a slight pain in his shoulder and stood up; a young monk was standing next to him and started walking without saying a word.
Nagato followed him.
They passed through groves of bamboo and avenues of cedar, and came to a wide stone staircase rising between two embankments, on which the moon cast a snowy whiteness. They climbed this staircase, which led to the terrace of a tall pagoda, whose roof, flared like an upside-down lily, ended in a slender spire, turned in a spiral.
The young monk stopped and motioned to Nagato to stay where he was, then walked away. The prince then saw a white shape emerge from the pagoda and step out of the gloom cast by the roof. The moonlight struck it. He recognised the Kisaki. She was dressed in a long sleeveless tunic of white silk, falling over a robe of golden cloth. It was the costume of the High Priestess of the Sun.
- Queen!" exclaimed the prince, rushing towards her, "am I the prey of a dream? this costume...
- It's mine now, Ivakoura," she said. I have laid down my crown and come closer to heaven. However, out of a final weakness, I wanted to see you once more, to bid you farewell forever.
- Ah, perjurer!" exclaimed the prince, "that's how you keep your promises!
- Come," said the queen, "the night is mild, let us leave this open space.
They walked down a long alley lined with bushes and filled with a silvery mist.
- Listen," she said, "don't condemn me without hearing what I have to say. A lot has happened since you left Kioto. I want you to know, my friend, that on the day you saved me, the day we talked for a long time, sitting at the foot of a bush, a man was watching us.
- That's impossible!" exclaimed the prince in horror.
- It certainly is. Instead of fleeing, the man who kidnapped me came back and listened to us. He was a spy for Hiéyas. This treacherous man took advantage of the secret his servant had discovered and revealed it to the Mikado. At first, the son of the gods didn't believe it; he was still full of anger against the infamous man who was bloodying the country. But by skilful manoeuvres, Hiéyas managed to change the mikado's mind and win his trust. Your devotion and heroic conduct during the attack on Kioto were given as proof of our criminal agreement. One day the son of the gods asked for me, and when I was in his presence he handed me a document in which our conversation was reported, but distorted and rendered infamous. Lies have never stained my lips. I confessed proudly that I had given you my soul, but that as long as I lived I would not be ashamed of my actions. But after this confession I could no longer stay at the Dairi.
The high priestess of Ten-Sio-Daï-Tsin had been dead for some time. She was my husband's sister. I asked to fulfil her priesthood, wishing to end my life in retirement. The mikado immediately sent me the title I wanted, and a few days later he married Hiéyas's granddaughter, a child of fifteen.
- You have left the palace of your ancestors to kneel, solitary and grave, in the shadow of a temple, you the smiling goddess whom a whole people adored.
- I'll love this solitude, Ivakoura," she said. Here I am free, at least, free from the tenderness of a husband I did not love, even though he was a god. My thoughts will be entirely yours.
- Why won't you run away with me? Haven't we suffered enough? You love me and I breathe only because you are here on earth. What's the point of torturing ourselves like this? Let's go into exile!
You are our homeland; the world is where you set foot! What do we care what men say! The heavenly music of our love will drown out their despicable voices.
What does it matter to the bird that flees drunk with light to hear the murmurs of reptiles tied to the marshes?
- Shut up, friend," she said; "don't make me repent for wanting to see you again.
- Why don't you want to hear me? Why are you so implacably cruel? Since your husband has taken another wife, you are free now.
- No, Prince, I have not fallen that far; the Mikado has added another woman to his list of wives, but he has not elevated her to the position I occupied. If I were truly free, despite the blame I would incur, I would empty the wedding cup with you and go live wherever you wanted.
- Ah! I'll kill the man who's keeping us apart!" exclaimed the prince, whose mind was wandering.
- Silence, Ivakoura!" said the queen in a serious voice. Look at the garment I am wearing. Think of what I am. From now on I no longer belong to the world; its fevers and follies can no longer touch me. Purified by the divine flame of the Sun, I must meditate on its mysterious and creative essence, absorb myself in its splendour, let myself be penetrated by its rays, identify with the light and become as pure as itself, until the day my soul flies away and receives its deserved reward.
- Forgive me," said the prince; "what do you care about a man's despair? See, I am calm now, as calm as the dead in their graves. Forgive
me for hurting your ears with words too human.
- I have the power to forgive now," she said, "and I absolve you with all my soul.
They retraced their steps.
At the end of this alley, bathed in a diffuse light, everything would be over for them; they would leave each other, never to see each other again.
In spite of herself, the high priestess slowed her pace. The prince's sudden calm frightened her; she could feel that it was the result of an irrevocable resolution. He was silent and looked at her with an expression of appeasement.
- He wants to die, she thought.
But she felt that nothing she could say would shake his decision.
They had reached the end of the driveway and were walking out onto the terrace.
- Farewell," she said.
As she said this, her heart seemed to break in her chest; she was about to fall into the Prince's arms and cry out to him:
- Take me away, let's run away wherever you want!
- Farewell," he murmured, "don't forget that you gave me a rendezvous on the threshold of the other life.
She fled with a sob.
Near the pagoda, she turned round one last time.
She looked supernatural in the moonlight, her golden dress shining beneath her silk tunic, as white as her face.
Ivakoura stretched out her arms towards her, but the high priestess of the Sun sank into the shadows, which enveloped her and hid her forever.
XXX
BATTLES
Hiéyas was at the gates of Osaka with an army of three hundred thousand men. Coming from the northern provinces he had crossed the great island of Nipon, crushing in his path the detachments charged with guarding the country. The soldiers of Fidé-Yori had died heroically, not a single one had retreated; the troops of the princes had put up a feeble resistance, on the contrary. Moreover, the army of Hiéyas, as powerful as a river swollen by the rains, could not be hindered in its march. It arrived near Osaka and enveloped the city. Without resting, they attacked it from all sides at once.
Fidé-Yori had divided his army into three corps of fifty thousand men each: Signénari and Moritzka commanded the first, Harounaga, Moto-Tsoumou, Aroufza the second, Yoké-
Moura the third. The soldiers were intrepid, the leaders determined to die if they could not win.
The first clash between the armies was terrible. They fought with unparalleled fierceness and fury. If their numbers had been equal, Fidé-Yori's troops would have won, but they were so determined to let themselves be killed rather than retreat that they were unshakeable. General Yoké-Moura was attacked by twenty thousand men armed with rifles; he had only ten thousand soldiers around him, established on the hill called Yoka-Yama; Yoké-Moura's men also had rifles. One discharge followed another until the ammunition ran out. Yoké-Moura had been waiting for this moment. He had noticed that his attackers were armed only with rifles and sabres and carried no spears. So he stormed down the hill. His soldiers, spears in fist, threw themselves on the attackers who, almost defenceless, retreated in disorder.
Signénari, too, after a fierce battle, had managed to drive back his attackers, but on all the other points the generals, crushed by numbers, had been beaten and had retreated, with what remained of their soldiers, into the interior of the city.
Evening came and the fighting stopped. The exhausted soldiers lay down in the city streets, on the bridges and along the canals. Only Signénari and Yoké-Moura were still outside Osaka, one on the plain, the other on the hill.
When night had fallen, a man came up to the foot of Yoka hill and asked to speak to General Sanada- Sayemon-Yoké-Moura.
Sayemon-Yoké-Moura, on behalf of Hiéyas.
He was ushered into the warrior's tent.
Yoké-Moura recognised one of his old comrades-in-arms.
- You've come on behalf of Hiéyas," cried the general reproachfully.
- Yes, friend, I believe in the powerful genius of this man; I know how useful his triumph would be for the country, and yet, now that I am in your presence, I hardly dare express the proposal I have been asked to make to you.
- Is it shameful then?
- You shall be the judge: Hieras holds you in high esteem, and he thinks that to triumph over you would be a defeat for him, because your death would deprive the country of its best warrior. He offers you to join him. Your conditions would be his.
- If Hiéyas really holds me in high esteem," replied Yoké-
Moura, why does he pretend to believe that I'm capable of selling myself? You can tell him that if he gave me half of Japan, I wouldn't even think about his proposal, and that my glory lies in remaining faithful to the master I have always served, and in dying for him.
- I expected this answer, and if I accepted this mission that was proposed to me, it was because I gave in to the desire to see my old companion again.
- Weren't you afraid of the just reproaches I might make of you?
- No, because I didn't feel guilty. Now I don't know what remorse torments me in the face of your quiet and heroic devotion. I feel that my actions, dictated by wisdom, are not worth the folly of your blind loyalty.
- Well, there is still time to repent, stay with us.
- I will, my friend. Hiéyas will understand, when he doesn't see me coming back, that the man who came to buy you has given himself to you.
The same proposal was made to General Signénari.
- Hiéyas offers to give me anything I want," cried the young general, "so let him send me his head!
The next day, considerable forces had gathered in front of Signénari. The young warrior realised that the battle ahead was his last. He went round his camp, exhorting his soldiers. Grave, gentle and as beautiful as a woman, he went through the ranks, demonstrating to the attentive men the little value of life, not hiding from them that the outcome of the day was death or dishonour. He added that a glorious death was enviable and that the life of a coward was not worth that of a dog.
Then he returned to his tent and sent a messenger to his mother, telling her that he was going to die and sending her a rich dagger in memory of him. Then he approached a mirror and poured perfumes over his hair, and placed his black horn helmet on his head, topped above the forehead by a copper blade cut into the shape of a crescent. He tied it under his chin and cut off the floating ends of the silk cords. This meant that he would never untie them again, that he was dooming himself to death. If his head was carried to the victor, the latter would understand that he had killed himself voluntarily.
The battle began, and it was Signénari who attacked; he rushed to the head of his soldiers with impetuosity. They broke through the enemy ranks and massacred many of them. Signenari's army, decimated the day before, reduced to a small number of men, penetrated the enemy army like a ship in the sea, but the waves had closed behind it, it was enveloped, captive, yet more fiery than ever; the soldiers of Hiéyas thought they had imprisoned a storm. The desperate are terrible, the carnage was frightening; the wounded were still fighting, the earth flooded with blood was softening, people were trampling in the mud, you could have thought it had rained. However, ten thousand men against a hundred thousand could not hold out for very long. The heroes surrounding the young leader were not defeated, however; they did not retreat, they let themselves be killed in the square they had conquered. But their numbers were dwindling fast: soon there was nothing at the centre of the army but a huge heap of corpses. Signenari, covered in wounds, formidable, was still fighting. He was alone, the enemy hesitated in front of him, he was admired, but someone shot an arrow at him and he fell.
Hiéyas, lying in a litter, was on the battlefield.
The grave and charming young head of General Signénari was brought to him; he saw the cords of the helmet cut; he breathed in the perfumes with which the hair was flooded.
- He would rather have died than join my cause," he said with a sigh. Today's victory saddens me as if it were a defeat.
That same day, Fidé-Yori sent for Yoké-Moura and asked him what remained to be done.
- Tomorrow we must attempt a general sortie," he replied.
All the remnants of the armies gathered in the city form a total of around sixty thousand men, to which we must add the garrison of the fortress, the ten thousand men I have left, and the ten thousand volunteers you have gathered: we can begin the fight.
- Will you enter the city?" asked the Siogun.
- I think it would be better for me to keep my advanced position on the hill. When the army moves off, I'll attack from another point, so that he'll be forced to divide his forces.
The chiefs were brought together to consult with them. The seriousness of the situation silenced the discord that usually divided them: all submitted to Yoké-Moura.
- The enemy has spread out all around the town," said the general, "so that at the point you attack, you will encounter forces at most equal to your own. The exit should be to the south, so that, if possible, you can drive the enemy into the sea. Let the leaders inflame the soldiers by their example and their words, and we can triumph.
- I myself will lead the army," cried Fidé-Yori. The insignia that preceded my illustrious father in battle, the golden gourds with the red staffs, which have always been a signal of victory wherever they have appeared, will be drawn from their velvet scabbards; this memory of Taïko-Sama will enthrall the soldiers; it will remind them of ancient triumphs, of glorious battles won under his shadow. This talisman will protect us and fill the perjurer Hiéyas with dread, evoking before his eyes the image of the man whose trust he has betrayed.
The chiefs returned to their soldiers to prepare them for the decisive battle of the following day. Fidé-Yori ran back to his fiancée.
- This could be the last day we spend together," he said, "I don't want to waste a second.
- What are you saying, my lord?" said Omiti, "If you die, I'll die too, and we'll be reunited never to leave each other again.
- Anyway," said the king with a sad smile, "I would have liked our happiness on this earth to have been longer. I have been unhappy for so long, happy for so few days; and you, so devoted, so gentle, have suffered all kinds of hardship because of me, and as your reward, when I would like to shower you with riches, honours and joy, I can only give you the spectacle of the horrors of war and the prospect of imminent death.
- You gave me your love," replied Omiti.
- Oh yes," cried the king, "and that love, which was the first, would have been the last; it would have filled my whole life. What can I do to take you away from here, to flee this battle, this carnage! Power doesn't matter to me! It hasn't given me happiness. To live close to you, in a deep retreat, oblivious to men and their criminal ambitions, that would be true happiness.
- Let's not think about that," said Omiti, "it's an impossible dream; to die close to each other, that's a joy too, and it won't be denied us.
- Alas!" exclaimed the siogoun, "my youth revolts at the thought of death. Since I have found you, my beloved, I have forgotten the disdain I was taught for this fleeting life; I love it and I would not like to leave it.
Under the cover of darkness, Harounaga managed to regain the heights of Tchaousi that he had lost. General Yoké-Moura had advised him to make this attempt, the success of which would protect the exit from the Siogoun.
Everything was ready for the last effort, the soldiers were full of ardour, the chiefs were hopeful, Fidé-Yori was regaining confidence and he believed in victory. One thing saddened him, however, in this supreme situation, was the absence of his most faithful friend, his wisest adviser, the Prince of Nagato: what had become of him? what had happened to him? In the twenty days or so since he had abruptly left Osaka, there had been no news of him.
- He is dead because he is not near me in the hour of danger, the siogun said to himself, sighing deeply.
From daybreak, the inhabitants of Osaka crowded the area around the fortress; they wanted to see the Siogun emerge from the castle in full battle dress, surrounded by his richly dressed warriors.
In the meantime, they chatted with the soldiers camped in the streets, pouring them glassfuls of sake. The city looked cheerful: despite everything, the light-hearted nature of its inhabitants was back in evidence. They were going to see a show, they were happy.
Around the eighth hour, the gates of the second wall of the fortified castle opened wide, revealing a confusion of banners floating among the luminous stripes formed by the high lances.
The first corps of spearmen from the Siogun advanced, breast-armoured, wearing visored helmets flared around the nape of the neck and decorated above the forehead with a sort of copper crescent, spears in fist, a small flag slung behind the left shoulder; then came the archers, their foreheads girded with a white cloth headband whose ends floated back, their backs bristling with long arrows, holding the great lacquered bow in their hands. After them came a number of strange figures who looked more like large insects or fantastic crustaceans than men. Some wore large helmets adorned with copper antennae above their grimacing black masks; others had their headdresses adorned with enormous horns curved towards each other, and their masks bristled with moustaches and red or white eyebrows; or else a bonnet of chain mail pulled back over the face, leaving only the eyes visible, enveloped their heads. The pieces of armour, made of black horn, were square, heavy and strangely arranged, but under the stitches of silk of various colours that joined the blades of horn together, they produced a beautiful effect. These warriors, dressed as their ancestors had been, were armed with halberds, huge bows and two-handed swords. They marched for a long time, to the great admiration of the people. Finally, Fidé-Yori appeared on a horse with a plaited mane. They carried before him the golden gourds which, since the last victories of Taïko-
victories, had not left the castle. They were greeted with shouts of enthusiasm.
- I entrust them to you," cried Fidé-Yori, pointing out the glorious insignia to his army.
He said nothing more and, drawing his sabre, galloped off.
With a heroic dash, the whole army rode out of the city. The people followed them as far as the outskirts.
From the top of the hill, Yoké-Moura watched Fidé-Yori and his troops advance out of Osaka and spread out across the plain, waiting for the first offensive movement of the siogoun to attack Hiéyas' men from his side.
- Signénari, who died so nobly yesterday, and his heroic soldiers have done a great deal of harm to the enemy; I myself drove back the detachment attacking my position, causing them considerable losses. We can cut to pieces the part of the army that the Siogoun will attack. Then the two enemy forces will be more or less on an equal footing, and with equal strength we will triumph.
Fidé-Yori's army had stopped on the plain and was occupying the site
where the Signenari camp had stood the day before.
- What are they waiting for?" wondered Yoké-Moura; "why have they stopped moving forward?
The leaders were running up and down the flanks of the battalions. There was a strange restlessness in the ranks. Evidently something new had happened, people were hesitating, consulting each other. Suddenly, the army was shaken to its core, turned around and retraced its steps back into the city.
- What does this mean?" exclaimed Yoké-Moura, stunned and pale with anger. What madness has suddenly seized them? Are they cowards?
The soldiers of Hiéyas then advanced, crossing the plain abandoned by Fidé-Yori. At the same time, Yoké-Moura's men raised the alarm. They were being attacked from two sides at once.
- It's all right," said Yoké-Moura, "all is lost now.
- He summoned his young son Daïské.
- My son," he told him, "go back to the town, join the Siogoun and tell him that all I have to do now is die gloriously for him, which I intend to do before tonight. Stay with the master as long as he lives and die with him.
- Father," said Daïské, giving the general a pleading look, "I would prefer to die by your side.
- Do as I command, my son," said Yoké-Moura, his voice trembling slightly.
A tear rolled down the boy's cheek, but he said nothing and went away.
The general followed him with his eyes for a moment as he descended the hill. He sighed, then suddenly threw himself into the battle.
Without having fought, without having exchanged an arrow with the enemy, the Siogoun army had returned to the town in disarray. The people didn't want to believe it. What had happened?
How had the rout preceded the battle?
Here's what had happened: Harounaga, suddenly abandoning his position on the hill, had run towards Fidé-Yori, accompanied by a man who had come from the camp of Hiéyas. This man, who was a relative of Harounaga, claimed that most of the army had been sold to Hiéyas and that, at the moment of battle, Fidé-Yori would be surrounded by his own soldiers and taken prisoner. He said that he had overheard this secret and had run to warn the Siogun and prevent him from falling into an odious trap.
- Go back to the fortress," he told Fidé-Yori, "in the shelter of its ramparts, you can still defend yourself and die nobly, whereas here you are at the mercy of the victor.
After some hesitation, we returned to the city. This story of betrayal was completely inaccurate: it was a perfidy on the part of Hiéyas who, although he was strong, did not disdain to use trickery. But the people did not accept this reason, and the return of the soldiers had the most deplorable effect.
- They don't know how to behave, they said.
- They're lost, it's all over now.
- After all, it's none of our business.
Half the population was beginning to wish for the advent of Hiéyas.
The siogoun had barely returned to the castle when the enemy army attacked the outskirts of the town. The inhabitants shut themselves up in their houses. A terrible battle ensued, the ground was defended foot to foot. However, the enemy advanced.
They were fighting in the narrow streets, on the banks of the canals, whose blood-reddened waters were littered with corpses, and every bridge was swept away after a fierce struggle. Little by little, the soldiers of Fidé-
Yori's soldiers were pushed back towards the fortress.
There was great confusion in the castle, no one thought of defending the first wall, the bastions no longer existed and the moat had not been dug back more than two feet. They locked themselves in the second enclosure, but there they were too far away to be of any service to those fighting. After three hours of fighting, they were driven back to the castle walls; they invaded the first enclosure and shouted for the second to be opened. They were about to be crushed against it.
Yodogimi shouted to open up. All the doors opened at once, and the soldiers rushed in. But the enemy was hot on their heels, and when they had passed through, the doors could not be closed and Hiéyas's soldiers entered behind them.
Fidé-Yori had locked himself in with a thousand soldiers in the third enclosure of the castle, which surrounded the great tower of the Golden Fish, the residence of the siogun and some of the palaces of the noblest princes. He was not thinking of defending himself, but only of not letting himself or any member of his family be taken alive. In one of the rooms of his flat, sword in hand, between his mother and his fiancée, he looked out of the open window and, brow lowered, listened to the tremendous clamour of the soldiers fighting behind the second wall. Many of his people were surrendering. The man in charge of guarding Taïko-Sama's golden gourds - his name was Tsou-Gava - was burning them in front of the palace, in front of Fidé-Yori.
- It's all over!" murmured Fide-Yori. O you who are the dearest thing in the world, you are going to die because of me and with me! We're going to have to take your lives, so that you don't fall alive into the hands of the victors.
He looked down at his naked sword, then up at his mother and the gentle Omiti, with an expression of bewilderment.
- Is it not possible to save them?" he cried, "to let them live? I don't care who wins, as long as I die!
- To live without you!" said Omiti reproachfully. They were both pale, but calm.
- I don't want to see their blood spilt, I don't want to see them dead; it is I who will die first!
XXXI
THE BURNER
- No one will die!" suddenly cried a voice, just as Fidé-Yori turned his weapon on himself.
The Prince of Nagato appeared at the threshold of the room.
Loo was beside him.
- O my brother!" cried the Siogun, rushing towards him, "I never hoped to see you again.
- I knew that victory was impossible," said Nagato, "and I was busy preparing the means for you to escape from the enemy when your last effort to repel him failed. You are the only scion of your race, you are defeated today, but later your dynasty may flourish again.
- Is it really in your power to save us? said the Siogun.
- Yes, master," said Ivakoura. A boat is waiting for you near the bank of the Yodo-Gava. Raïden, a brave sailor whose devotion is well known to me, will take it up. He will take you out to sea and out to sea.
There, a large junk belonging to the Prince of Satsouma is at anchor ready to receive you. As soon as you set foot on it, it will sail to the island of Kiou-Siou; the lord of Satsouma, the most powerful prince in your kingdom, the most loyal of your subjects, will open his province and his castle to you; you can live there happily, close to the wife of your choice, until the day of vengeance.
- I'm very grateful for your tireless devotion," said the siogun, whose eyes were wet with tears. But how do you get out of the castle? How do you cross it without being massacred by the furious horde that surrounds it?
- You will go out as I came in," said the prince, "without being worried by anyone. If you will follow me to my palace," he continued, bowing to the two princesses, "I will show you the way out of the fortress.
- Prince," said Yodogimi, "your greatness of spirit fills me with confusion; I, who have so often tried to harm you, now see how unjust and blind I have been; tell me that you forgive me for my past mistakes, otherwise I will not accept to be saved by you.
- I have nothing to forgive you for, Princess," said Nagato, "it is I who am guilty of having had the incomparable blunder of displeasing you.
- Come on, let's get out of here," said the siogun, "you can explain later.
They left the room, with Loo in the lead.
In the first courtyard of the palace, the insignia of Taïko-Sama were still burning, forming a heap of embers. As they passed, Fidé-Yori turned her head away. They reached the pavilion of the Prince of Nagato and entered his room. The trapdoor that closed the underground pathway, through which brave Sado used to enter and leave the palace, was open. No one knew of the existence of this underground passage. The Prince of Nagato had had it secretly dug to facilitate Sado's comings and goings and to escape the surveillance of spies.
- This is the way," he said, "it leads to a fisherman's house on the banks of the Yodo-Gava. That's where Raïden is waiting for you with the boat; set off, Loo will guide you along this underground route.
- What!" exclaimed Fidé-Yori, "aren't you coming with us?
- No, Master, I'm staying here, I've still got something to do.
- Are you mad? Staying in this palace, which will soon be completely overrun; what else do you have to do? you won't be able to escape.
Don't worry about me," said the prince with a strange smile.
- Ivakoura!" exclaimed the Siogun, looking at his friend with fear, "you want to die! I understand you, but I won't accept salvation at that price. I'm still the master, aren't I? Well, I order you to follow me.
My beloved lord," said Nagato in a firm voice, "if it is true that I have served you with devotion, do not refuse me the first grace I ask of you, do not order me to leave this palace.
- I no longer order, friend, I beg you not to deprive me of a companion like you, I beg you to flee with us.
- I add my supplications to those of my son," said Yodogimi; "do not let us leave with pain in our souls.
- Illustrious Prince," said Omiti in his soft, timid voice, "this is the first time I have spoken to you, but I dare to beg you, in my turn, not to persist in your cruel resolution.
Loo threw himself on his knees.
- My master!" he cried.
But he could say no more and began to weep.
- I commend this child to you," said Nagato to Fide-Yori.
- Are you deaf to our voices?" said the siogun, "do our prayers have no power over your heart?
- If she were lost to you," said the prince, pointing to Omiti, "would you consent to live? O you to whom I have entrusted the terrible secret of my life, do you not understand how painful existence is for me? Can't you see the joy that shines in my eyes now that I am nearing the end of my suffering? It was to serve you that I did not free myself for a long time from the torment of living. You are not as victorious as I would have liked, but I see you in a retreat full of flowers, joy and love; you will be happy, if not powerful: you no longer need me, I am free, I can die.
- Ah, cruel friend," said Fidé-Yori, "I can see that your will is irrevocable.
- Make haste," said the prince, "you have delayed too long.
Get to the boat. Raïden will hide you under the folds of the sail thrown into the bottom of the boat, then he will take the oars, Loo will hold the rudder.
- No! no!" cried the child, clinging to his master's robe, "I don't want to go, I want to die with you.
- Obedience is the first virtue of a good servant, Loo," said the prince gently, "I order you to obey our master from now on, and to serve him until death.
Loo rushed, sobbing, down the dark underground stairs, the two women followed him, and then the siogoun descended in his turn.
- Farewell! farewell! my friend, my brother, you, the most beautiful, the most noble, the most devoted of my subjects! he cried, letting his tears flow.
- Farewell, illustrious friend," said the prince, "may your happiness last as long as your life!
He closed the entrance to the underground passage. He was alone at last. Then he returned to the courtyard of the palace and, taking a piece of burning wood from the brazier that was still burning, he set fire to all the princely pavilions and to the palace of Fidé-Yori, through all the rooms of which he passed, then he went to the Tower of the Golden Fish and, from floor to floor, lit the fire. When he reached the last terrace, he threw down his burning firebrand and leaned against the red lacquer balustrade of the platform, which was crowned by a vast roof, raised at the edges and supported by four heavy pillars.
The prince looked out to sea. The little boat was already at the mouth of the Yodo-Gava. Alone on the water, it seemed to attract the attention of the victorious soldiers camped along the beach; but Raïden, the fisherman, cast his net, and the reassured soldiers let the boat pass. Out to sea, the Prince of Satsouma's junk appeared as a small brown spot against the crimson of the setting sun. The atmosphere was incomparably transparent. The sea looked like a great turquoise.
The shouts of the soldiers could be heard around the castle.
- Fidé-Yori had set fire to the palace: he would perish in the flames, they said.
Those still sheltered by the third wall opened the gates and rushed out, surrendering.
Moreover, the battle had ceased; the usurper was at the gate of the fortress; people knelt down as he passed by, acclaiming him and proclaiming him the only legitimate Siogun. It was the second day of the sixth moon of the first year of Nengo-Gen-Va
[1] .
From the top of the tower, the Prince of Nagato could see the litter in which Hiéyas lay. He could hear the triumphant cheers that greeted him.
- Glory and royal power are nothing compared to happy love," he murmured, turning his eyes back to the boat carrying his friends.
It was now out at sea, beyond the reach of the soldiers; it was unfurling its sail and fleeing rapidly.
- They are saved," said the prince.
He could see the beginning of the road leading to the sacred city, which he had travelled so many times; he could see the coastline, silhouetted against the blue of the sea, stretching away into the distance, towards the province where the ancient temple of Ten-Sio-Dai-Tsin stands. He seemed to be trying to make out, across the distance, the woman he was never to see again.
The sun disappeared and the light of the fire began to overcome the brightness of the day. The siogun's palace, at the foot of the tower, was a vast furnace which, seen from above, looked like a lake of fire, agitated by a storm. The flames criss-crossed, swirled and formed volutes like waves in a storm. Every now and then, a cloud of red smoke passed in front of the Prince's eyes, obscuring the horizon. Every floor of the tower was on fire, and a tremendous roar, mingled with perpetual crackling, filled its sides. The last platform, however
The last platform, however, had not yet been reached, but already the floor was cracking and swaying. A flame rose and touched the edge of the upper roof.
- Come, then, liberating fire," cried the prince, "come and soothe the devouring burn of my soul, strive to extinguish the unquenchable flame of my love!
He took a crumpled piece of paper from his chest and unfolded it. He lifted it to his lips and read it one last time in the glow of the fire.
"One day the flowers will bow down to die, they will let their luminous souls fall like diamonds, and then the two drops of water will join and merge.
The heat was intolerable. The paper suddenly burned between the prince's fingers. He was gasping for air and felt himself dying.
My beloved!" he cried, "I'm leaving first, don't make me wait too long for the rendezvous.
Like the enormous petals of a fiery flower, the flames enclosed the last terrace and spread across the roof; the two gigantic golden fish twisted on the crest of the roof as if they were alive, then flowed in two incandescent streams. Soon the whole building collapsed, with a terrible crash, sending an immense spray of flames and sparks skywards.
