ZULEÏKA
I
The Nile flowed slowly, in the silence of the night, carrying with it the broken reflection of the broad stars that stained the dark ether of the sky.
And, like another river, a caravan, taking advantage of the cool night air, made its way in good order along one of the banks.
Occasionally, a cry was heard, activating the pace of a beast of burden; the crack of a whip tore the silence, and the rhythm of a momentary trot sounded muffled on the sand.
The caravan wanted to enter Oph, the royal city of the Pharaohs, before sunrise; they hurried on, but already the sky was bleaching, the stars were fading one by one; objects were appearing, still colourless, but cutting out their black silhouettes on the lightened atmosphere.
The camels, arching their long necks and swaying their heads with hanging lips, the donkeys, half disappearing under their loads and harassed by their drivers, the wagons, pulled painfully by large oxen that mooed from time to time, emerged more and more from the shadows.
Soon the pink ibises, which had been sleeping with one foot in the water, whipped the air with their great wings and stretched their limbs; lammergeiers took to the air with high-pitched cries, the Nile lit up, along with the sky, and a beam of golden rays burst from the eastern horizon.
Then the caravan stopped, all the men prostrated themselves, their faces turned towards the East, and, answering one another, intoned the morning hymn.
"O Ra! Lord of Radiance, shine upon the face of Osiris!
"Let him be worshipped in the morning and let him lie down in the evening; let his soul go out with you out of the night; let him sail in your boat; let him board the ark; let him rise into the sky!
"Hail to you, Ra Haremku Khepra! who exist by yourself!
Splendid is your rising on the horizon; the two worlds are illuminated by your rays; the diadem of the south and the diadem of the north are on your forehead.
"I come to you, I am with you to see your disc every day. I am not shut in, I am not pushed away. My limbs are renewed by the brilliance of your beauties, for I am one of your favourites on earth.
"Hail to you, who shine on the horizon during the day, and who travel the skies, united with the goddess Ma. All men rejoice to see you walking towards them; in your mystery they prosper, they progress, those who are illuminated by your rays.
"O unknown one! Incomparable is your brilliance; you are the land of the Gods! All the colours of Arabia are seen in you!
"O sun, who has no master! Great traveller through space! Millions and hundreds of thousands of leagues you cover in an instant; you disappear and remain, O Ra who rises on the horizon!
"Glory to you, who shine in the Nun, who illuminated the two worlds on the day you were born, given birth by your mother with her own hand; you illuminate them, you divinise them, great illuminator who shines in the Nun!"
While everyone was kneeling and glorifying the resplendent sun, stretching out their arms towards him, a young man whose costume was different from that of his companions and who seemed to be of a higher status than them, remained standing and took no part in the prayer. A smile of vague contempt even wandered across his lips when his eyes were lowered towards the prostrate and pious group; then, raising his forehead, he fixed his clear gaze on the sun and bore its blinding brightness with an air of defiance and pride.
Although he had the appearance of a master, this handsome young man did not seem to command the people in the caravan.
They were merchants who peddled natrum, myrrh, sandalwood powder and all sorts of aromatic and medicinal plants, and who also occasionally sold slaves.
When it was time for the merchants to set off again, the young man walked among them without complaint, although he looked very tired and unaccustomed to fatigue.
The walls, gates and palaces of Oph the Great appeared on both sides of the river, and the caravan entered the city, which was beginning to wake up.
The young foreigner, stunned by the magnificence of the scene before him, gazed with growing admiration at Oph, which was shining superbly in the rising sun.
- God of my fathers!" he exclaimed in ecstasy, "never has such a marvel struck my eyes. My sorrow is softened by this splendour. I trust in you, God of Abraham! And I enter without fear into this city where I will be a slave, for your purposes are inscrutable.
II
A few hours later, the foreigner was sold in the marketplace, and the man who bought him was Putiphar, Pharaoh's minister.
- What is your name?" he asked his new slave, taking him with him in his chariot.
- I am Joseph, son of Jacob, and I was not born into servitude.
- My yoke will be light or heavy for you according to your merits," said Putiphar. I am a gentle and humane master, but severe if need be, and full of justice.
The chariot noisily entered the courtyard of Putiphar's sumptuous house, the servants rushed around the master and kept up the impatient horses, covered in foam.
Attracted by the tumult of the arrival, a woman appeared in the portico of the palace, accompanied by a group of servants carrying feather fans attached to golden poles. She stood at the top of the steps, standing out brightly against the darker background of the portico, and smiled at Putiphar, who waved to her.
The woman was beautiful and still young. Her slightly broad face, with its accentuated cheekbones, thick, crimson mouth and enormous eyes enlarged by two lines of antimony, had an excessive freshness of life! A fluted piece of cloth with gold threads running through it was placed on her forehead and along her cheeks, like the headdress of a sphinx. A pectoral of jewels shone on her chest; her round, brown arms were encircled at the wrists and shoulders by enamel bracelets; her dress, knotted under the breast and hanging slightly over the hips, was made of linen with oblique stripes of blue, green and black.
- Rest today," said Putiphar to Joseph, "and tomorrow I'll put you in charge.
And he went up the steps, wrapping an arm around his wife's waist, who leaned towards him and said in his ear, looking at Joseph stealthily:
- Who is this stranger?
- He's a slave from Arabia," said Putiphar. I bought him this very day.
Barely a month had passed, and Joseph had become Putiphar's steward; everything prospered under his direction; the Master had taken his slave in great friendship and placed all his trust in him.
III
In the women's flat, delightfully cool and fragrant, opening onto an inner courtyard, the centre of which was carved out as a pool and filled with limpid water, Zuleïka, Putiphar's wife, had gathered together a cackling group of noble friends.
The stubby pillars with their flowery capitals, painted in alternating colours, cast their shadows; the water gently kisses the black marble steps and reflects, shivering, the paintings on the colonnade and the high cornices.
All these women are lying on blue leather cushions, swollen with the down of thistle flowers, some on their stomachs, leaning on their elbows, others overturned, their arms rounded above their heads, some with their torsos straight and their backs against a pillar. Only Zuleïka is standing and talking animatedly, frequently interrupted by a clatter of clear voices.
At this moment, these pretty Egyptian girls are all talking at once, and the tumult rising from the inner courtyard startles a lammergeier perched at the top of a granite pyramidion, causing it to fly away, pink against the deep blue sky, with a discordant cry.
- Haven't you heard that he is more beautiful than Pentaour, the Pharaoh's œris?
- Our princes are the most beautiful in the world, and you can't expect us to believe that he surpasses those whose foreheads are adorned with the royal viper.
- I know some who don't have a flaw.
- I've met some that capture your heart at first sight.
- There are some you dream about, having crossed paths with their boat on the Nile.
- What's so wonderful about this one?
- Is it the expression in his eyes?
- Is it his smile?
- Is he very tall?
- Is his voice seductive?
Zuleïka covered her ears with both hands, tucking her head into her shoulders, then exclaimed, when the noise had died down a little:
- He is more beautiful than the princes, more beautiful than Pentaour, more beautiful than Osiris and Horus on their celestial thrones; his presence is an enchantment, his walk a spell, his voice music; whoever has seen him sees him again and again; his gaze is a red-hot iron that wounds your heart...
The young voices burst out again.
- She's madly in love! She's blinded by passion...
- She's lost, she's been cursed.
- Let the high priest come and say the magic spells.
Let him hurry!
- How can we believe her, with her eyes dazzled by love? Her beloved is probably quite ordinary.
- Maybe he's cross-eyed and toothless...
- With a humpbacked shoulder...
- And a crooked leg...
And the laughter began to flow, like drops of water in a pool.
One of the laughing girls stood up and, arms outstretched, shouted as loud as she could:
- If she wants to convince us, let her show us this incomparable man.
- That's it! that's it: let her show us!" cried the whole audience, clapping their hands.
The woman being called upon kept silent for a moment, then, stamping her foot and raising her forehead:
- Well, yes," she said, "you'll see him!
She called a slave and spoke low, and the slave walked away.
The young women were now silent, readjusting their hair and the folds of their clothes, worried about looking beautiful in front of the man who was said to be so handsome. They also thought about putting on a brave face, looking indifferent and distracted. They reached for the fragrant wooden baskets full of beautiful ripe fruit and, taking brass knives, slowly began to peel the tender pulp.
Soon the slave returned; he lifted a spartan door and stepped back against the wall. A nervous footstep sounded on the flagstones.
All the young women, their mouths half-open, stared towards the entrance.
Joseph appeared in the doorway.
He was tall and proud, despite the submissive and reserved attitude he maintained, and, despite his modest costume, of incomparable beauty.
His complexion had a radiance and transparency that were especially charming to eyes accustomed to the bronze of Egyptian skins. Her soft, curly hair floated lightly down to her neck, and an emerging beard cast delicious shadows around her mouth.
In the great silence that greeted the entrance of the young Hebrew, a few cries were stifled, and more than one girl suddenly brought her finger to her lips, as if to suck a wound, or quickly wrapped her hand in the hem of her dress. The brazen knives, misdirected by the beautiful onlookers, stunned with admiration, had cut into the delicate flesh instead of peeling the fruit.
Joseph saluted, placing his hand on her heart and then on her forehead.
- I await your orders, mistress," he said.
- I don't have any orders to give you, young stranger; it's an idea that came to me, that you must be suffering cruelly, you who were born to command, to be a slave far from your home, and I wanted to ask you if there's nothing in my power that could soften your servitude.
- I am happy, as much as I can be in my misfortune, thanks to the trust and kindness of my master.
- Keeping your wounds to yourself is not the same as healing; enduring pain that could be worse is not the same as happiness. Confide in us without fear and tell us your secret desires.
Joseph raised his long eyelashes, which he had been keeping lowered, and suddenly revealed the blue gleam of his singularly domineering gaze.
- I am in God's hands," he said; "His designs are unfathomable. I have nothing to desire in the present, and I bow my head to the threats of the future.
- Is the future threatening?" said Zuleïka sharply.
What can you dread in our midst?
- Twice, a dream has warned me that from this palace I will roll into an abyss, with no branch to offer my hand to save me; I submit to the will of God.
- Do you believe in the vain follies of dreams?
- I know how to explain dreams," said Joseph gravely.
And he added:
- Allow me to return to my work, to carry out the master's orders.
- Go!" she said with a long sigh.
The young man stepped back into the shadow of the doorway, and the drapery fell away.
IV
Some time later, on a sweltering hot day, Joseph was resting in his master's garden, under a clump of mimosas, near a pink marble pool. He was gazing dreamily at an ibis standing motionless at the edge of the pool, which seemed to have been carved out of the stone, so closely did the colour of its plumage match the flesh tone of the marble.
Suddenly, he was roused from his reverie by a light footstep crunching the sand.
He looked up to see his master's wife walking towards where he was sitting.
She approached him before he had time to get up and greeted him with a smile.
- You were thinking about your country, young foreigner," she said; "although you are almost the master here, do you miss freedom?
- I regret nothing with a master like mine," said Joseph.
- But, no doubt, you have left some newly hatched love behind, and your heart is far from us?
- No love calls my memory back to my country," he said.
he said.
- Then I'll bet," she exclaimed with a smile of joy, "that many women are consumed by you and mourn your absence.
Then she added, looking at him with tenderness:
- It seems to me that if you went away, I would die of sadness. Not to see your sparrow hawk eyes any more, or your mouth that looks like a wet flower, or your supple body that moves so gracefully, that is beyond my power. My life would be over with you.
Joseph blushed at this speech, which surprised and embarrassed him.
She mistook his confusion for the emotion of unexpected joy, and put her lips to Joseph's ear.
- Love me," she said; "I already love you with all my soul.
I'll make you a delicious life, you'll be the master, the god; I'll become the slave.
Joseph stood up in horror.
- My master has every confidence in me; after him, there is no one greater than I in his house; he asks me to account for nothing, gives me nothing; nothing is forbidden to me but you, who are his wife; and I would betray such a master, I would commit such a heinous crime?
And the young slave walked away, not wanting to hear anything more from Putiphar's wife.
V
From that day on, Joseph carefully avoided being alone with Zuleika. When he was obliged to be in her presence, he never looked at her, even though she never took her eyes off him and sighed her heart out.
Once, he crossed paths with her on a palace staircase; she was going down, he was going up.
She rushed forward and grabbed Joseph's hands before he could defend himself.
- Look at me," she said in a dull voice; "see my eyes reddened by tears, see my temples bruised by fever; I cry all day long, and at night I writhe on my bed like a snake on a fire. I call out to you and implore you in vain. Do you have nothing but the heart of a tiger in your beautiful, marble chest?
Putiphar appeared at the foot of the stairs; then she left Joseph and continued to descend.
VI
One harvest day, all the servants were outside the palace.
Joseph went into a room to get a papyrus he had left there.
Putiphar's wife was in the room, sitting on a very low bed.
- You are looking for your papyrus," she said.
And she handed the scroll to Joseph.
He went over to her without hesitation to take it from her hand, but then she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him so tightly to her chest that he couldn't get away.
- I beg you, don't run away from me," she cried, "have pity on me, don't be crueler than the crocodiles of the Nile! What have I done to you? I love you, I bend at your feet and you reject me, you torture me.
- Please," said Joseph in a firm voice, "leave me alone, if you don't want me to use my strength to free myself from your embrace.
Your frail arms would break in my hand; move away, I implore you, so that I don't break you.
But she paid no heed to his words and pressed herself tighter against him.
- I'll kiss that lovely mouth at least once," she said, pressing her lips to his.
she said, pressing her lips to his.
Joseph felt his reason slipping away from him; he went numb, like a wild bird handled by a warm hand.
However, with a violent effort, he untied this tenacious embrace and pushed his master's wife away from him. But she held on to one side of his cloak.
Joseph quickly undid the clasp on this garment and, leaving it in Zuleika's hands, fled out of the room, out of the palace.
The Egyptian woman, thus driven away by a slave, flew into a rage; she rolled on the ground, tore her face, screamed, wept, bit her fists and swore revenge.
Her husband surprised her in this state of fury.
- What's the matter? What's happened to you?
- Are you asking? Well, I'll tell you: I want you to know that this slave, whom you cherish so much and shower with so many riches, took advantage of the absence of your servants to do me violence and abuse me. Look: here is his cloak, testifying against him.
When Putiphar heard this, he became as angry as his wife; he broke several objects and cursed his trust a hundred times. Then he sent for Joseph and, not wanting to hear him, had him thrown into prison.
VII
Three years after this event, Putiphar's wife was walking sadly on the banks of the Nile with her wives and some eunuchs.
She thought of Joseph, who had disappeared from her life, but who was her constant thought. She could not go back on her revenge, because that would mean admitting that she was the only one guilty; and she bitterly regretted the time when she could at least see him every day and breathe the same air as he did.
Sometimes, however, the outrage would rise to her forehead and she would rejoice in vengeance.
That day, dull and pale, her head lowered, more crushed than ever by the weight of her vain love, she wandered slowly along the banks of the Nile.
Suddenly, a triumphal procession emerged from a street, and she stopped mechanically to watch it pass.
Heralds marched at the head of the procession, proclaiming the dignities of the triumphant king.
Pharaoh, favoured by Ammon-Ra, said:
"Since God has made mysterious things known to you, and you have revealed my dreams to me, you will be on my house, and all my people will kiss your mouth; I alone will be greater than you on my throne.
"I have taken my ring out of my hand and put it in yours, and I have dressed you in fine linen and put a golden collar round your neck. You will ride in a magnificent chariot, the most beautiful after mine, and people will be shouting to kneel before you.
"Your name shall be Zaphenath-pahanea, and I give you Ascenath, daughter of the high priest of On, as your wife. No one shall make a move in all the land of Egypt without your command.
When the triumphal chariot moved forward and Zuleika saw the man riding it, handsome, calm and resplendent in finery, she recognised Joseph, the slave, who had despised her and whom she believed had been crushed by his vengeance.
It was a terrible shock, a dazzle, a torture and a joy. Shame and desire swelled her heart to such an extent that it seemed to break, spreading a burning wave within her that overwhelmed her.
But the violence of the burning purified her. She felt annihilated and regenerated at the same time.
As she slumped at the side of the road, watching the one who had triumphed without pride, who had shone in the eyes of all like a torch in the night, the unknown slave who had become the master of Egypt, because he had walked only towards perfection, she finally understood true love; love outside the flesh, outside life, outside time. She understood that if the beloved was fleeing from her, it was to show her the way, to draw her towards the celestial heights, where only she could join him, perhaps, after countless centuries of effort, tears and prayers, when she had become all light and all love, when she finally deserved to sink, a drop of light, into the infinite light, a particle of love in the unlimited love that is heaven.
THE BOOK OF THOT
A MAGICAL TALE
I
The handsome young man ran along the Nile, avoiding obstacles, brusquely pushing aside those who hindered his passage, raising murmurs, sometimes even pursued by an insult that he did not seem to hear.
He had entered Memphis just as the rising sun was turning the pyramids pink in the distance, and he was following the riverbank, which was crowded with goods, cattle, poultry and huge piles of vegetables and fruit being unloaded for distribution to the various markets in the big city.
The river was full of boats, canoes and rafts driven by bare-chested men; and as they approached the landing stages, there was an intractable brawl, arguments and assaults in which the dripping oars were brandished and fell on skulls. Sometimes, a load would capsize, amidst cursing and laughter.
The young man took no notice of anything, light and agile, always running, followed by everyone with surprised and worried looks; even a donkey driver, who was pushing his animals ahead of him, laden with goatskins full of wine, stopped, rising up on his toes to see, over the heads, if someone was not pursuing this fugitive: a thief perhaps.
Someone was indeed pursuing him, or rather following him, trying not to reach him, but not to lose sight of him. It was a middle-aged man, a bit plump, with slender hands and a noble, thoughtful face, which at the moment was gripped by an expression of anguish.
However, when he saw the man he was watching disappear around the corner of the esplanade of the Temple of Isis, panting, he slowed his pace and wiped his sweaty face with a flap of his white linen robe. He was sure of reaching the young man now, and he seemed reassured. Indeed, when he reached the temple square, he saw the fugitive sitting under a group of palm trees, elbow on knee, forehead in hand, and so absorbed that he had to touch him on the shoulder to attract his attention.
- Horus, my beloved brother, why do you do this to me?
The young man shuddered and exclaimed:
- Amena! You followed me!
- I thought I had guessed a disastrous plan. Was I mistaken?
Horus bowed his head in silence.
- Did you want to die?
- I still do!" he exclaimed vehemently, "this love burns me and suffocates me, it crushes my heart as if the great pyramid weighed down on it. To live like this is to die a hundred deaths in one day. I can't go on... I ran to the threshold of the temple, to see her one last time, to take her image to the Good House.
- Ah, villain! villain!" said Aménâa, her eyes reddening with tears, "is this how you repay all the affection I have had for you? Have I not been the Father and Mother who disappeared too soon from this world? To brighten your youth, have I not neglected my dearest work? And, in order to win you this toy of love whose desire was so maddening, did I not deprive myself of sleep, immerse myself in the study of grimoires, in order to wrest from the gods the secret of power?...
- But you didn't succeed!" said Horus with a sigh.
- How would you know?
The young man stood up, his eyes full of flame.
- Oh! speak! speak! my brother! Excellent scribe!
Amenâa made him sit down again and stood beside him, contemplating him.
- You are predestined for love," he said, "Nature has formed you for it with every grace, you can only suffer and live through love; but it also emanates from you as the aroma exhales from the lotus. Let her see you, this princess, so inaccessible to you; let your eyes, which are the colour of real lapis lazuli, rise just once to meet hers; let the mysterious flower of your smile blossom for her, and, I guarantee it, her heart will leap the distance that separates her from you.
- Your friendship for me blinds you," says Horus, "and even if she were clairvoyant, if Tantyris were touched by my suffering, she could only share it. I will never spend a happy day with her. Even reaching her is impossible: I'll be killed by the guards before I get near her shadow on the flagstones.
- You will approach her without encountering any obstacles," says Aménâa, "I will recite over you... what I will recite from my grimoire, and for a few moments you will be invisible to anyone but her.
- Ah, my brother, is that really possible? to see her up close! to drink the air that envelops her! to hear her voice, perhaps!
I didn't expect such great joy before I died.
- It's not a question of dying," said Aménâa impatiently, "now listen carefully to what you have to say to her.
But Horus was no longer listening.
Trumpets and horns announced the arrival of Princess Tantyris, daughter of Pharaoh Usirmari-Sotpuniri, son of the Sun, Ramses Miamun, beloved of Amonra; she had come to offer a sacrifice to Isis, the Powerful Mother.
As she passed, the crowd ran, shouting the formula of blessing:
- Life! Health! Strength!
But the heralds made way for the ebony palanquin adorned with gold paint, its stretchers resting on the shoulders of eight bearers whose hair was cut in the shape of a skullcap, according to a new Ethiopian fashion, and in which Tantyris was seated, resembling a divinity.
On either side, servants held the golden shafts of pink screens made of ibis feathers, and a hundred young girls, dressed in tunics of white gauze and walking in two lines, accompanied the princess.
Some priests came forward out of the shadow of the colonnades, others came to receive the offering for the sacrifice: a bull, a goose and skins of wine.
Then the princess descended and, followed by the hundred maidens, entered the temple.
II
Horus crept up to one of the obelisks in front of the forecourt, not daring to think that he was really invisible; but as no one noticed him, he went forward without hesitation and leaned against a pillar close to the main door of the temple. There he waited until Tantyris had finished praying and turned to walk past him.
His heart swelled with emotion as he recalled the speech that his brother Aménâa had just taught him, and, so close to the decisive moment of his life, it seemed to him that the minutes were sometimes as long as years, and sometimes flew by in a dizziness.
The trumpets sounded again, the maidens left the temple and the princess came forward after them.
Horus took a step and knelt down, blocking her way. But, contemplating her so closely, he forgot his speech, he forgot the earth and the sky.
She was dressed in a net of multicoloured beads over her gauze tunic, wearing a light helmet of guinea fowl feathers, and the air around her was filled with intoxicating scents.
- What are you doing here, young stranger? Why are you blocking my path?
- O palm of love!" he exclaimed, clasping his hands together, "O royal maiden, more superb than the sparrowhawk of the mounts of the sun! you have made my life redder like wine mixed with water, you have embalmed it like perfume poured over a weft, you are burning it like flame devours the branch...
Tantyris recoiled in pride.
- Do you not know who you offend?" she said, with a sword-like gleam in her long dark eyes.
As one who is drowning rises from the water when he has hit the bottom, Horus came to himself, sank from his drunkenness, and said, suddenly calm and lucid:
- I know what you are. All riches, all earthly powers are yours; and yet I, Horus, obscure mortal, beloved brother of the magician Amenâa, can give you even more. No prince, no king of the world, would dare to attempt what I want to attempt to conquer you.
As he spoke, still on his knees, she bent her head towards him, ashamed of the numbing pleasure she felt in gazing into those eyes, the colour of the night sky, which rose so radiantly towards her.
- So what is it?
- I know where in the world the Book of Thoth is, the magic book that the God wrote with his own hand, and which places those who possess it immediately below the gods. Two formulas are written in it. If you recite the first, you will charm heaven, earth and all of nature; if you read the second formula, you will see the entire cycle of gods in their divine forms, and even if you are already in the grave, you will be able to revive your earthly form:
- Where is this marvellous book?" asked Tantyris.
- It is in the sarcophagus where lies Noferkephtah, son of King Minibphtah; he conquered it with great difficulty and took it with him to the tomb. That is where I will take it, to give it to you in exchange for your love, which is worth more to me than the hours of eternity.
- I swear by Phtah that it will be so," she said. "Bring the magic book, and you will be my husband! But what dangers! you may perish!
- If I perish, my torment will end with me; if I triumph, I will bring you the treasure with which I will be more fortunate than a God.
He walked away, turning his head to look at her again, while she forgot to go down the steps and followed him with her eyes, saying to herself: - This one certainly takes my heart, and it is not the Book of Thoth that I am going to wait for with anguish and hope.
III
The blue night and the twinkling stars half-lit the arid gorges of the necropolis of Memphis, and, leaping over the crumbling rocks, the jackals fled, snapping their famished jaws, their ears pricked up to a living sound, in the midst of the funereal silence.
Horus and his brother Amenâa, the Excellent Scribe, had already been wandering for many hours in the city of the dead, who, fearing above all the visit of the living, hide their dwellings.
And they could have wandered like this for nights, days and years, without ever discovering the entrance to the tomb they were looking for, if Amena had not held a magic wand in his hands.
They went on like this, between the chalky walls whose pallor whitened the night, until the stick shivered and turned its point towards a section of rock that seemed to have broken away from the mountain.
- This is it!" said Aménâa.
- Alas!" cried Horus, "how will we be able to move this enormous stone? Our muscles will be ruptured before it has even swayed!
- The magic rod increases my strength a hundredfold, and it's a lever that doesn't break.
Without effort, Aménâa tipped the rock and uncovered the entrance to the underground passage; but as soon as they entered, the rock fell back, closing the opening.
- It doesn't matter!" exclaimed Horus. If we seize the miraculous book, all obstacles will fall before us; if not, may the tomb guard us!
And, fearless, he was the first to enter the gallery that ran beneath the mountain.
A strange half-light, pale, greenish and soft, reigned in this Western Region, such as, on nights of waning moon, fish see it, perhaps, at the bottom of the Nile.
Far away, a plaintive and tender clamour, enough to make the cruelest weep, suddenly spread through the silence; a slow and long howl, which seemed to traverse harps; a painful call, which grew, became terrible; then, becoming languid, sank into a harmonious sob.
Aménâa murmured:
- It is Anubis the barker, the greyhound god, guardian of the dead.
And all the simulacra of the divinities, painted on the walls, slowly turned their eyes towards the violators of the Good Abode; everything was moved by Anubis' cry of alarm: the statues shook their emblems, the hawks flapped their wings; from the corners of the high hall, women, raising their feathered arms, flew up, striking the vaults in fright.
A rumour grew louder and louder, like the sound of rushing waters. And the mummies, throwing back the covers of their sarcophagi, raised themselves on one hand and looked. Some sat on the edge of the funeral bed; others rose from the ground and, tearing off their bandages, fled; a crowd soon swirled round, plaintive, frightened and threatening.
Horus advanced without hesitation. His brother had joined him, embracing him with one of his arms and protecting him with the magic rod.
But suddenly there was a sinister lake in front of them, its black water like liquid basalt; a lake made of all kinds of venom, poison, fever and pestilence, floating with livid foam and deadly vapours.
Then all those who had been awakened from their great sleep by the sacrilegious living formed a wall behind them, pushing them further and further towards the putrid water, towards the horrible engulfment.
And the waves rose with a thrust; Sevek, the crocodile, master of this lake, emerged, opened his greedy jaws and held them wide open before the certain prey.
- Ô ! Amena, Excellent Scribe," said Horus, "this is the end of our hope. Will you forgive me, you whose death I cause?
But Amenâa stooped down, took a handful of silt and moulded it in his hands. He gave it the shape of a pharaoh's rat, the animal feared by the crocodile. Then he recited a grimoire over the rat, which came to life. Then he threw it into the monster's mouth, saying:
- Crocodile, guardian of the lake, if you do not obey me, this rat, which I have created, will devour your heart! What I command is this: be for us a docile boat that will carry us to the other shore.
Already feeling the bite, the crocodile moved to throw off his enemy; but, unable to do so, he pulled up alongside like a docile boat.
The two brothers climbed onto its scaly, slippery back. They sailed across the sinister lake, while the whole crowd of disappointed shadows, watching them drift away, twisted in despair.
A great light attracted them when they reached the other shore; they walked towards it, and behold: it was the Book of Thoth, the Book of all knowledge, which shone like a star and illuminated the tomb.
Horus ran to it with outstretched hands.
But then Nopherkephtah, the owner of the treasure, rose from his funeral bed and said, in a slow, dead voice that chilled the heart:
- What have you come to do?
- I've come to take it.
- Know that, for having stolen it, I have been deprived of the duration of earthly days that was due to me. Woe to him who possesses it!
- No matter, it will be mine.
Nopherkephtah lowered his mummy-like hand and closed it like a vice on the arm of the bold young man.
- You couldn't take it," he said, "so dare to play fifty-two with me.
- I dare," said Horus.
Then the dead man let go, sneering. He pushed a checkerboard between them. And, in the depths of the tomb, illuminated by the Magic Book, they played this terrible game.
Nopherkephtah won the first move. He immediately struck Horus on the head and made him sink into the ground up to his knees. But Amenâa came and stood behind his brother, directed his game and made him win the last move.
- The stake is mine," cried Horus.
And he laid his hand on the divine book.
Nopherképhtah gave a frightening cry; he became as furious as a panther of the South, and pounced on the sacrilege.
But Amenâa threw himself in front of him, took the brunt of the blow and fought on.
- Take the book," he shouted to his brother, "save yourself, take it away, and don't worry about me any more.
Horus seized the dazzling treasure and fled, taking all the light with him, while the living man fought the dead man in the darkness of the tomb with hoarse sighs and rales.

Pharaoh's palace was like a city within a city, a marvel among splendours.
It was the hour when the king entertained himself, enlivened his heart and his mind, in the company of the most beautiful women in the world. And on this particular day, the meeting was held on the banks of a delightful lake, full of lotus flowers, with shady shores and clear water the colour of opal, amber and emerald.
Under a kiosk with light columns of multicoloured wood, the pharaoh was seated, with Nofirouri, the great royal wife, and their beloved daughter, Tantyris, the perfect princess, beside him.
On the lake sailed a boat in the shape of Pik-ho, the serpent with a glittering face, guardian of the third hour of the day, and the oars, made of ebony wood trimmed with gold, were held and manoeuvred by twenty young girls, chosen from among the beautiful. They were dressed in tunics of gauze, the light weave of which revealed enamel gorgets and, encircling their flanks, golden harnesses adorned with jewels. Lotuses bloomed on their heads.
The king took pleasure in watching the graceful efforts of the twenty young girls as they all weighed on the oars and then lifted them out of the water, their beautiful white bodies stretched out and bent over, watching the boat go round and round and round.
But suddenly a rumour disturbed and drowned out the voice of the hidden music, which gave rhythm to the movement of the oars.
Pursued by the guards, who were armed with spears but did not dare strike him, a man dashed up the steps of the kiosk, unmoved by the royal majesty, and threw himself at Tantyris' feet.
Recognising Horus, she gave a slight cry and half closed her eyes. But the king's heart was burning, his gaze death. Before he could curse, the princess caressingly leaned on his arm and said:
- Father! I beg you, don't say any evil words. Behold, I have sworn by Phtah that he would be my husband if he would bring me the Almighty Scripture, the Book of Thoth, which Nopherkephtah jealously guarded in the tomb. And see, in his hands, the divine grimoire blazes, burning our eyes.
She took the book, which Horus held out to her, and gave it to Pharaoh.
The king, moved and charmed, held the book reverently for a long time, not daring to open it. Then he said:
- First let my Khri-Habi, the excellent magicians, be consulted.
And he had a gold box brought to him to lock up the magical treasure.
Meanwhile, the beautiful bride and groom, no longer knowing where in the world they were, gazed at each other avidly, in such fullness of joy that the memory of that joy alone would have been enough to enchant their entire existence.
V
The pharaoh had given Horus a palace worthy of a royal prince, with all the servants, dignitaries, soldiers and riches that such a rank demands.
The very next day, with great pomp, they were to bring him the divine Tantyris, the wife he had conquered. And that day ended with the king making magnificent preparations for the wedding.
When night fell, the princess, giddy with happiness, went up to her upper room to rest. Her favourite maid, Tméni, which means swallow, undressed her, took off her finery, undid her hair with its countless braids and, when she was in bed, lay across the bed to serve as a cushion for her mistress's charming feet.
Three musicians, playing the harp, the flute and the crotales, played a languid, gentle melody to lull the princess to sleep; but she dismissed them with a gesture, so that she could better hear her reverie and let herself be deliciously rolled and rocked by the waves of her love.
And so, in the peaceful room, dimly lit by veiled lamps, time passed.
And then came the fateful hour of nightmares and ghosts.
---------------
Suddenly Tantyris awoke, trembling with anguish.
Outside, there was a great noise of storm and tempest, through which she thought she could make out dreadful cries that could not have been uttered by human lips.
She pushed Tméni with her foot and tried to call out to him, but her voice died in her throat.
In a gust of wind, the wide window had just opened wide and, in the flash of lightning, a throng of pale, frightening beings besieged the opening and rushed into the room. Frozen, as if dead, she felt herself being dragged from her bed, carried through space, and suddenly lost all consciousness of herself.
VI
When she awoke, she was still moved by the horrible dream that had disturbed her sleep. But she thought of Horus, of the happy day that was dawning, and, smiling, looked around her.
She was lying in the sand at the feet of a granite colossus, and all around her was the desert!
She stood up, distraught, with a long, terrified scream.
So it was true? she had been snatched from her bed, from her palace, taken out of the city? and by whom? by spectres!
Was she going mad? Or was it just another dream?
She tried to calm herself, to think: "People will notice that I've disappeared," she said to herself, "everything will be in an uproar; the whole town will be looking for me. Where am I, first of all?
Steps cut into the pedestal of the colossus, she climbed them and looked up.
In the distance, in a smoky mist, violet, close to the ground, and all gold against the pale sky, obelisks pointed out, temple friezes rose above the greenery and the infinite jumble of houses.
- This is Memphis, the home of Phtah!" exclaimed Tantyris, who quickly dismounted and set off in the direction of the city.
For a long, long time, she walked under the sun, in the sand that burnt her bare feet, soiled with dust, weary, weary to death. At last she reached a road, but not knowing whether her bleeding footsteps were taking her closer to Memphis or further away, she ran out of courage and dropped to the edge of the path, sobbing into her hair.
A donkey driver passing by, carrying two baskets full of figs to the market, stopped in front of her and asked her what was wrong. The princess wiped away her tears, regaining hope.
- Isis has sent you!" she said, "throw the baskets your donkey is carrying over there and take me to Pharaoh's palace. You will then be rewarded in such a way that you will never need to return to the market.
- You have the tone of a commander," said the peasant, "but you don't look like someone who could keep such fine promises. Out of humanity, I'll give you a lift; but, out of caution, I won't throw away my figs.
He took the baskets on his back, put Tantyris on the donkey and, leading it by the bridle, hurried towards the big city.
VII
- Here is the king's palace. Life! Health! Strength!" said the peasant, after walking for more than an hour, "but there's a huge crowd around me; I can't get any closer.
Tantyris, full of impatience, jumped to the ground.
- Come back whenever you like," she shouted to him, "tell the palace that the bride has sent you, and you will be rewarded.
She fled, slipping through the crowd forming a hedge, and dashed across the open square, heedless of the jeers with which she was hounded.
Having reached the royal portico, she tried to pass through, but the guards met her with their pikes held high. Brutally they pushed her back, chasing her, and she would have fallen under their blows had not a stranger thrown himself in front of them and received her in his arms.
- Leave her alone", he said to the guards, "she's my sister, she's lost her mind.
- Don't you see who I am?" she cried, "don't you recognise your royal princess?
- Be quiet," said the stranger, leaning towards her, "you could be seized and imprisoned; then all would be lost.
The curse that pursues those who possess the Book is upon you.
On hearing this, Tantyris looked at the man who was speaking to her. His body was all torn and bruised, as if a ferocious beast had half devoured him; but the gentleness of his gaze and the nobility of his face inspired confidence and respect.
- Who are you?" she said.
- I am the scribe Amena, the brother of the one who, for love of you, descended into the tomb.
- Ah! lead me to him, save me! she cried.
- My ungrateful brother no longer knows me," he said, "he has left me prey to the most terrible danger, without even giving me a thought.
- You must forgive him, it's my fault, I took all his heart...
- My life is his," said Aménâa; "but I have lost my power: the magic rod has been taken from me. Horus must now face the trial alone. If he triumphs, happiness for you; if not, lost forever! Attention! The music is playing and the wedding procession is advancing.
- But this is a wedding that cannot be celebrated without me!
says Tantyris.
- Well, you think so!
And, pale with horror, the princess saw another Tantyris come forward, carried in a magnificent litter after the orchestras and the dancers, looking very much like herself, marvellously adorned and radiant with joy.
- Horus must choose between you and her," said Aménâa.
If he makes a mistake, it's all over. Go, run to your father, and may Isis protect you!
The pharaoh, in a chariot adorned with gold, walked beside the bride.
Tantyris threw herself in front of the horses, which reared back in fright, and she jumped into the chariot, landing on the king's chest.
- Father! Father!" she cried, "acknowledge your blood, save me from all this fear. She is not your daughter, she is a horrible ghost, usurping my form and taking my place!
- My daughter!" murmured the king, "what a state she's in! But how can that be?
And he looked in turn at the one he held in his arms, and at the false Tantyris, who leaned out of the litter and said in a soft, melodious voice:
- She is undoubtedly a poor fool; above all, she must not be mistreated. I don't want any unfortunates on the day of my happiness.
Horus had emerged from his palace in full regalia and was advancing to meet his betrothed.
- Come! come! my son," cried the king, "let's see if the lover will be more perceptive than the father. The gods are angry with us. They are offering us a riddle, the solution to which, I foresee, may be terrible. It's up to you, I think, to solve it.
And Horus, full of dread, exclaimed:
- Woe betide the possessor of the Book! predicted the dead man from whom I took it. Ah, I understand the horror of this vengeance: if I don't guess right, it's the end of us!
Trembling with fear, his face pale as alabaster, he looked alternately at the two princesses, one dishevelled and defeated, her eyes full of tears, the other triumphantly beautiful in her finery, gazing at him with an intoxicated smile.
An anguish gripped the whole watching crowd, breathing stopped in oppressed chests and absolute silence reigned.
The young man, as if fascinated by the gaze, heavy with languor, that weighed on him, seemed to make up his mind: he took a few steps towards the litter.
Then, believing herself lost, Tantyris let out a heart-rending sob.
Horus stopped, putting his hand to his heart, which had been pierced like the blade of a sword.
He ran to her, seized her in his arms, clasped her to his chest deliriously, saying through his tears:
- It's you! It's you! my beloved! How could I have hesitated for a moment?
Immediately, the woman in the litter opened her mouth with a loud cry: then she disappeared, leaving only a handful of ashes in her place.
Then the crowd, stamping their feet with joy, let out a long, tremendous cheer, which rose into the sky, frightening the birds, and continued until the king, stretching out his hand, demanded silence.
---------------
- Let a sacrifice of gratitude be offered to the Gods, who have kept misfortune away from us," he said loudly, "but here is the Book of Thoth: no one shall open it, no one shall read it; let it be placed back in the tomb of the man whose death it has already caused. The Gods, who are very good, have given us Power, Wealth, Beauty and all the good things of the earth; they have even granted us a large share of heaven, since we have Love.
Let us be content with these gifts, and let us not arouse the divine wrath by laying a bold hand on the veil of the unknown, which no living person is allowed to lift.
BILKIS
Saba, who gave his name to the country of the Sabians in southern Arabia, was the great-grandson of Katan and the third-great-grandson of Noah.
grandson of Noah. He was the fourth grandfather of King Zou-Chark, father of the radiant Bilkis, the most illustrious of princesses.
Bilkis was the only surviving of forty children; she was marvellously beautiful, of rare intelligence and wisdom.
When her father died, she seized the throne and declared herself sovereign, but only half the nation accepted her as queen, and the other half proclaimed a brutal, witless man named Bnou-ak-el-Milik king. He soon abused his power. Tyrannical and debauched, he kidnapped his subjects' wives and dishonoured them. Many revolts broke out against him, but in vain; he could not be overthrown. It was then that Bilkis, indignant at so many crimes, resolved to rid the land of Sheba of such a man.
Bnou-ak had wanted to marry the beautiful queen, but she had rejected the union with disgust. One day, however, she pretended to consent, and everything was soon prepared for the wedding.
A superb procession led the queen to the court of Bnou-ak, and the wedding was celebrated with the greatest pomp. During the wedding feast, Bilkis intoxicated the prince, and when she was alone with him, she cut off the head of the sleeping tyrant. The brave queen hid the bloody head in a fold of her dress and went out quietly.
The dancing had ceased, the singing had died down and the torches were extinguished. She slipped stealthily through the dark, deserted palace, past the sleeping guards without being seen, and into a palm grove. There, a servant was waiting, holding two horses that quivered with impatience, gnawing and shaking their jewelled bits. The queen jumped into the saddle and fled towards her palace. As soon as she had reached it, she sent messengers to all the chiefs and high officials of the court of Bnou-ak, calling them to Mareb, the capital of Sheba, and before daybreak they were gathered in front of the palace of Bilkis.
This palace was built on seven terraces that rose up from one another. All the great men and warrior chiefs of the court of Bilkis were arrayed on these terraces when dawn began to break.
Just as the sun's first rays hit the roof of the palace, doors opened on the highest terrace, and the queen appeared resplendent in her bridal finery, stained with the blood of Bnou-ak.
With a gesture, she calmed the admiring murmurs of the multitude and spoke in a high, sonorous voice.
She reproached Bnou-ak's subjects for their spinelessness, their cowardice, their willingness to bow their heads under shame and outrage, their inaction, their deafness to the cries of their dishonoured wives demanding vengeance. - What none of you dared to do, I have done," she said in conclusion: "I have delivered you from the infamous tyrant stained with crimes; now choose another master, this is what I have done with Bnou-ak. And, uncovering the livid head of the dead king, she threw it over the terraces towards the people.
- We want no other sovereign than you!" cried the crowd in a single voice.
And so Bilkis became queen of the land of Sheba.
She reigned with wisdom and glory, dispensing justice herself and using the time left to her by the government to study the science of the magi and to compose moral maxims and symbolic formulas.
One day, the beautiful queen had fallen asleep in a mysterious room on the seventh terrace, beyond six other magnificent rooms.
This retreat, to which Bilkis often retreated, had no windows other than a narrow square opening on the sunrise side. The seven doors were locked and the keys, made of different metals, hidden under the pillow stuffed with ostrich down where the queen rested her head. When Bilkis woke up, she picked up a letter that had been placed on her chest, but the queen couldn't explain how it had happened. The letter was sealed with a musk seal and sealed with Solomon's seal. It read as follows:
"King Solomon, son of David, to Bilkis, Queen of Sheba.
"In the name of the Lord, merciful and just, greetings to those who walk in the right way. Do not think that your glory is greater than mine; come to me and acknowledge my power.
The queen, surprised and worried, called her servants and questioned the guards; nothing had been seen and no stranger had been able to enter the palace. She summoned the great men of the court, told them of the adventure and asked for their advice. But all deferred to her judgement and justice.
Before taking a decision, the queen ordered prayers and sacrifices, a black bull was slaughtered after being sprinkled with salt, and Bilkis herself went to burn incense in all the city's temples: in the Temple of the Chain, the Temple of Matter and the Temple of the Soul, all three of which were circular in shape. Then she visited the sanctuaries dedicated to the stars: the temple of Zohal, which described a hexagon; the temple of Marrîkh, a long square; that of Chams, who is the Sun, a square; that of Otared, a triangle; that of Zahara, a triangle inscribed in a long square; the temple of Kamer, the Moon, was octagonal. These different shapes were linked to allegories and mysteries that the Sabeans never divulged.
When the ceremonies were over, Bilkis decided to send presents to Solomon:
- If he is only a king," she said, "he will accept the gifts and will not invade our territory; if he is truly a magus, he will refuse them, for he should desire nothing more than to see us embrace his principles. I'll find out whether his eyes can distinguish truth from lies.
She had five hundred of the most handsome young men in the kingdom chosen and dressed in rich girls' costumes; they were adorned with gold necklaces, bracelets and earrings adorned with jewels, and given superb horses with harnesses of gold and silk to ride on; then five hundred girls took the male costume and rode on more ordinary horses: Bilkis also sent Solomon a splendid crown, musk, amber, sweet-smelling aloes and a carefully sealed box. She enclosed the following letter:
"If you are a magician, guess which envoys I am sending you, and declare what is in the box before you open it.
The procession set off and reached the plain of Sana, where Solomon was camped. The envoys then saw a long stretch of ground paved with gold and silver bricks, and all around a wall with battlements, alternately of silver and gold. The paving was missing just as many bricks as the Sabeans had brought. Fearing that they would be accused of stealing these bricks, they hurried to place them in the empty squares.
Solomon easily discovered that the girls were boys and the boys girls, and he declared that the box contained a virgin, undrilled pearl of unusual size.
Then he sent the Sabeans away with their gifts.
Shortly afterwards, Bilkis herself set off with a marvellous escort, followed by her entire army.
Solomon, forewarned of her visit, had a palace built to receive her. The architect made the forecourt of crystal, and underneath, clear water flowed, filled with beautifully coloured fish.
When Bilkis arrived, the king, moved and dazzled by her beauty, went towards her; she crossed the threshold and, thinking she was walking in the water, raised her dress a little, hesitantly putting her foot forward. The king-prophet then saw that the beautiful magician had a hairy leg; but his budding love, shaken for a moment, persisted nonetheless, and the hopes of the cunning councillors who, fearing the alliance of these two powers, had persuaded the architect to build this treacherous forecourt, were dashed.
And Bilkis, seated on a throne next to the king, offered him a series of riddles, to which, without ceasing to admire the beautiful visitor, he answered with certainty.
When she came to the last one, the most ingenious of all, she finally hoped to embarrass him:
- Why," she asked him, "has God willed that the stone of your seal should be the most powerful thing in your kingdom and in the world?
- To teach me," replied the king, "that my kingdom and the world are not worth a shard of stone.
The Queen of Sheba admitted defeat in wisdom, but she was also triumphant, for she had won the king's heart.
And Solomon married Bilkis.
THE GOLDEN-HAIRED STAR
Beneath the starry firmament, the ancient city of Midian lies massive and dark, asleep. A few high towers and white domes sketch out vague, pale curves; a palace with mighty walls dominates the city, and around it trembles a music.
The musician is the north wind, brushing against the harps hanging from the windows; the harps whose frail strings gleam here and there, extending the rays of the stars: you think you can hear the shimmering.
The first vigil passes, the living are as good as dead in their sleep. But the king has risen from his warm bed, and slowly, from room to room and terrace to terrace, he climbs to the top of the palace.
He must pass through seven gates and climb seven staircases. At a mysterious word he utters, the doors open in front of him; first it's a lead door, then a pewter one, the third is made of bronze and resonates as it closes; then an iron door opens, then a bronze one, the sixth is silver and the seventh gold; it falls behind the king with a long, clear vibration.
The crisp air makes his white linen robe flutter, for he is on a vertiginous platform that brings him closer to heaven. He looks north and south, west and east.
Then he sees such things among the stars that a cry escapes his lips and pierces the peaceful night. Trembling with emotion, he sprang to the stone ledge and, leaning on it with both hands, looked out towards the infinite.
Kévan [1] , the distant planet, the interpreter of destinies, the great revealer of the mysteries of heaven, is advancing in the sign of the fish towards the dwelling of Ormuz [2], which shines with an unusual brilliance, while above them passes a marvellous star, trailing after it like a sheaf of gold! In the East, the constellation Virgo rises from the horizon, with Leo preceding it and the Cattle Dog following! At the Zenith, in the sign of Alsartan [3] , near the nebulous Crib, the stars known as the Donkeys sparkle brightly; Taurus ascends towards the centre of the sky, and Nembrod [4] walks towards Aries in the west.
The king gazes avidly, his eyes dilated, and, without ceasing to contemplate, he goes to strike with his closed fist the brazen disc which, with a single blow, sounds the precise moment of illustrious births.
But the king strikes and strikes again, relentlessly and forcefully.
The metal shudders and rumbles, the sound swells and expands, it's a swell, an ocean of noise, rolling over the city and submerging it. And soon, loud clamour responds to it, lights are agitated, guards, their weapons gleaming, appear on the terraces; ministers, princes, venerable magi, reopen the mysterious doors, dedicated to the seven planets, and hasten towards the platform. They speak confusedly, and questions collide.
questions.
- Sage Gathaspar, is this the end of the world?
- What terrible omen have you read in the Book of Heaven?
- Is the enemy threatening our borders?
- Master, why do you strike fear into our hearts?
But Gathaspar raised his arms to the stars.
- Behold! behold!" he cries, "a new day is dawning in the West. "A star is coming out of Jacob, a sceptre is rising from Israel! Behold! Never since the day Moses was born has Kevan met Hormuz under a hairy star; the celestial tablets bear witness to this! But the star of the illustrious magus, who lived for forty years in our homeland, was not as splendid as this one. And who can surpass Moses? Who else but the Messiah promised to the world, announced by the prophets; the sceptre before which all sceptres will bow, the king of magi and kings? Zaphikiel, the archangel seated on the planet Kevan, and the one whose throne is Ormuz: Zadukiel, have both beckoned me to leave without delay, to greet the divine child in the land where he was born. Go and get the richest offerings ready, so that I can set off before the star disappears from the sky.
And, as the king ordered, the caravan was formed. It set off before dawn, a brilliant throng of soldiers, slaves and camels laden with gifts. It has now been travelling for several days. The night before, they had wandered into deep mountain gorges, and the star marking the direction to follow had disappeared behind the peaks; during the night they had lost their way, and since sunrise they have been trying to find their way out of the harsh gorges.
Preceded only by a few scouts, the king advances at the head, mounted on a white camel caparisoned in azure and silver; but he has dozed off under the silk tendelet, and around him they march in silence.
Towards the middle of the day, the travellers entered a valley, and they soon reached a crossroads where several roads converged. But the place was already crowded: horses, mules, a whole richly dressed crowd, coming and going, looking from side to side. Gathaspar dismounted to enquire, and was shown a magnificent litter, its curtains fringed with gold. A handsome old man, his head adorned with a triple crown, leaned out; he wore a saffron-coloured tunic and a black cloak studded with gold.
Gathaspar saluted, pressing his hand to his heart; but the old man gave him a mysterious sign, and the king, recognising a magician like himself, approached and kissed him on the mouth.
- My son," said the old magician, "like me you have seen Tzegel and Koracht, the friendly planets of the day, and the hairy star that heralds a new sun, and like me you are going to greet him?
- Are you not Melkone, King of Tharsis?
- As surely as you are the King of Arabia, Gathaspar!
- We are lost, aren't we? The star has disappeared behind those high peaks, and the cloud-covered sky will not let us see it again tonight.
As they spoke, a man on horseback followed by a lone squire rode up one of the roads radiating from the crossroads. The newcomer's face is wonderfully black, his features fine and regular, his mouth the ruddy colour of a pomegranate flower. He is wrapped in a purple cloak that covers his head and is held around his neck by a golden rope.
He rides with youthful grace and great majesty.
Without setting foot on the ground, he greets the two kings when he comes within their reach.
- Word, Light and Life!" he exclaims, "we have achieved the fateful ternary, we can walk now. If you weren't waiting for me, I was looking for you, because I knew where to find you.
- Who are you, night-faced mage?" asked Melkone.
- I am the descendant of the greatest of the magi, for my grandfather was Menilech, the incomparable son that Bilkis, Queen of Sheba, had with Solomon, King of Israel.
- Hail Bithisarca, King of Sheba, master of us all!" said Gathaspar, bowing, and the old Melkone pressed his hand to his heart. But Bithisarca quickly dismounted to embrace them.
- My brothers," he said, "you have understood the celestial signs as I have: a king has been born for us and we are going to him! As you have seen, the sun itself is his pedestal, so we owe him the homage due to the sun, for there is none more solemn.
But we must send away this multitude and these vain riches: symbolic offerings are enough for those who will reign through the spirit.
- Wise Bithisarca," said the King of Tharsis, "do you know the road we must follow? For, as you can see, we are lost.
- I know, as you do, that we must look for this king in Judea, but I have not taken the time to ask the oracle about the precise place where we will find him. Since we're very close to Jerusalem, let's go and consult Herod, King of the Jews; his pontiffs have no doubt warned him of the prodigy.
Towards the end of the day, the three wise men, each followed by a slave carrying a box, entered Jerusalem through the Water Gate.
They passed the foot of Mount Moriah, on which the Temple, with its marble and gold, its elaborate balustrades, its majestic banisters and its roof bristling with needles, blazed marvellously under the slanting sun. Bithisarca, not without emotion, pointed out to his companions the formidable wall supporting the massive temple, made up of huge, uneven blocks of hard stone carved with great skill, each framed by a thin, smooth, hollow strip and set back from one another, as in Egyptian constructions; an indestructible wall, which was the same one built by his grandfather, King Solomon.
In the city, the travellers saw new roads, wide and paved, buildings in the Greek style, theatres and circuses as in Rome. Bright, chattering crowds strolled about, stopping in groups or crowding round the school gates. The women lifted their veils, turned round to take a longer look at the long velvety eyes of Gathaspar and the luminous smile of Bithisarca; the young men gazed with respect at the long silver beard of the old king Melkone, and saluted him as he passed.
The horsemen continued on their way up to Herod's splendid palace, whose white marble colonnades, terraces, gardens, fountains and aqueducts covered almost half of Mount Zion.
The King of Judea, who copied Rome, received crowds of visitors every day, and although the hour of the receptions had long since passed, the soldiers on guard at the gates and in the courtyards did not dare to oppose the entry of the three Magi, whose majestic and superb appearance announced that they were persons of high nobility. Young boys, dressed in hyacinth-coloured robes with silver trimmings and crowned with flowers, offered to guide them to the king and inform him of their arrival. The travellers abandoned their horses and followed the beautiful children through the gardens, still full of flowers despite the season.
Suddenly, however, the boys stopped, as if frightened, and signalled to the magi not to advance.
They were in front of an artificial grotto made of basalt and porphyry, with a gilded bronze double door. The sun, which had made a hole in the clouds and was touching the edge of the horizon, filled the cave with light, making the lighted torch held by a young man leaning against the doorframe useless.
Herod was there, sitting on a stepladder with his back to the door. In front of him, a solid gold sarcophagus with a crystal lid stood upright, leaning against the bottom of the shallow cave, and through the crystal you could make out a woman who looked like a statue of amber caught in the ice.
- She's all crystallised now," said Herod.
She's all clear, all transparent.
- Yes, completely transparent", replied the young man distractedly, looking curiously at the magi and their guides.
But they quickly moved away behind a grove of olive trees and, without being questioned, one of the young boys explained what they had just seen.
- The king had her killed a long time ago, but he still loves her and has preserved her in honey. The cave had remained closed for several years.
A few moments later, Herod joined the Three Wise Men in a high hall with fine columns inlaid with rare stones and enamel.
The King of Judea was approaching his seventieth birthday; he was extremely thin, with withered flesh, as if deflated and marbled with burning redness; feverish activity deranged his movements, and when he embraced his guests, he breathed a sepulchral breath in their faces.
On hearing their questions about this king whose birth the heavens foretold, he paled, and confessed with a tremor of anger that he did not know the first word of this event.
Then he hurried them through the galleries and porticoes, twisting his purple toga around him and whimpering as he went. With a sudden gesture, he ordered the guards and slaves they met to follow them, and an escort formed behind them.
From time to time, he would mutter fragments of sentences in a breathless voice.
- It's always the same people! they're always busy with nonsense! or maybe they know and haven't told me; do they think I'm tired of knocking?
And he sneered menacingly.
They reached the end of Mount Zion, crossed the valley of the Fromagers on a very high bridge, and reached the esplanade of the Temple; there Herod turned back to the magi, whom he seemed to have forgotten, and said to them, with ironic emphasis:
- We are going to surprise the glorious Sanhedrin in the Hall of Carved Stones!
Then he showed them a marvellously chiselled golden Roman eagle that he had had placed on the great portico of the temple.
- Those priests are dying of rage over it," he said, "but we'll see if they dare take it away from there.
Herod and his guests entered through a reserved door and, as dusk was falling, their entrance was not noticed.
Hillel, the gentle and illustrious Nassi, presided over the assembly, and around him were a number of famous teachers: Shemaiah, Abtalion, Baba-ben-Buta, Judah of Galilee, Hezekiah and his friend Jacob-bar-Acha; Matthias-ben-Margaloth and Judah, son of Sariphaeus, both of whom were shortly afterwards burnt alive, along with forty of their disciples, for having torn the Temple's golden eagle to pieces.
When the king entered, a young student was asking the Nassi a question.
- They teach," he said, "that there are six things that are shameful for the scholar. What are they, Master?
And Hillel replied:
- To go out while perfumed, to go out alone at night, to wear mended shoes, to talk to a woman in the street, to sit with a company of ignorant people, and to enter the study room last.
- Why shouldn't he go out wearing perfume?
- Because he might be taken for a debauchee.
And Jacob-bar-Acha added:
- This prohibition applies only to clothing and not to the body, which is perfumed for the purpose of cleanliness.
- Shammai considers hair to be a garment," said Baba-ben-Buta.
- He's too strict," said Hillel, "you can think of it as the body.
- But why is there any shame in going out in mended shoes? If he's poor...
- Let's leave the mended shoes and all that perfume for a moment!" cried Herod in a voice that made everyone present jump with surprise. I'm not fooled by your naïve speeches; tell me what the heavens have in store for us, if your silly discussions have allowed you to raise your eyes to them.
Did you know that a king has just been born in Judea who is not my son? The Messiah, perhaps! Is this true? Did you know?
- We knew it, and it is true," said Abtalion, rising to his feet.
Then Herod flew into a rage, hurling insults and threats. But Hillel, whose wonderful patience was famous, replied gently:
- We feared, Master, knowing that you were ill, that the news would aggravate your illness.
- Ah! you think I'm ill!" cried the king with redoubled rage, "you hope for my death, you desire it, you intend to rejoice when it comes, well, I'm telling you, you'll weep tears of blood over my coffin.
- It is written, says Hillel: "The evil that you wish upon others turns against you"; we do not wish for anyone's death.
The wise men bowed their heads, regretting having come to Jerusalem. They remembered all Herod's crimes, and thought they saw him drenched in blood in his crimson toga, under the last red glow of the evening.
But the King of Judea suddenly calmed down and began to laugh:
- You see, it's the fever that excites me," he said. And where was he born, this King of the Jews?" he added, addressing Hillel.
- We don't know, my lord, but perhaps the high priest does.
- Let him be called.
Ioser, son of Boethos, was in the temple; he was summoned in great haste, and he entered, tiara at his head, resplendent in his priestly vestments, under the lamps that had just been lit.
He knew nothing more than what was revealed by the conjunction of Baal and Shabtai in the sign of Pisces, and by the hairy star announcing a hero. But he could immediately question the Teraphim.
So the students and all those who were not priests or doctors were ushered out of the hall, and Ioser went to the altar where the Torah was placed.
He took the Teraphim, the golden slides on which were engraved kabbalistic figures, and drew lots for a number of them; then, having removed the Rational attached to his chest, he surrounded it with the Teraphim, arranged three by three, between the two onyxes used as clasps for the chains of the Rational: the Urim and the Thumin, which corresponded to the two columns of the temple: Jakin and Bohas.
The high priest leaned back, his elbows on the altar, looking at the jewels and the magical signs. He remained absorbed for a long time, in the midst of the profound silence; finally he rose and exclaimed enthusiastically:
- The angel Souriel, prince of the divine face, spoke to me: "It is in the royal city of Bethlehem in Judea", he said to me, and is it not written in fact by the prophet: "And you Bethlehem, city of Judah, you are not the least of the principal cities of Judah, for it is from you that the leader who is to govern my people Israel will come forth?"
- That's fine!" said Herod, concealing his irritation, "we'll go to Bethlehem.
Then, changing his mind just as he was about to go out:
- I know your subtleties and your way of concealing the true meaning of words," he said; "so swear that this is indeed about a child, and that you do not mean that a new initiate has just been born into the science of magic, as you are wont to say.
- No, it's a child still in its swaddling clothes", said the High Priest.
Herod went out with the magi from the Hall of Carved Stones and said to them, barely concealing his agitation:
- Go! Go to Bethlehem; find out exactly what this child is, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too can go and worship him.
On leaving the Sanhedrin, the students had spread the news throughout the city, and when the Magi passed through again, it was filled, despite the night, with a hustling and bustling crowd; there was especially an old prophetess called Anna, who never usually left the temple forecourt and who, that evening, went through the streets, all dishevelled, shouting at the top of her voice:
- Rejoice, Jerusalem! For the expected Messiah has been born in Bethlehem!
The sky opened up completely as the three kings passed through the western gate of the city, and the golden-haired star appeared to them once again. They greeted it with joyful acclamations, and galloping their horses, they marched towards it.
Valleys and hillsides, orchards and meadows, and at last Bethlehem on high, silhouetted against the dark blue, its velvet-black silhouette spangled with gleams!
The Magi stopped at the foot of the hill to change their clothes, then climbed up and, without having to ask for directions, walked towards a house on which the star seemed to be hanging.
Bethlehem, the ancient and glorious little town where David was born, was not yet asleep; it seemed to be overflowing with people. Laughter and song escaped from half-closed houses, light trails
and streaks of light from the windows lit up the streets.
No one was guarding the door of this blessed house, towards which heaven was leaning. It was very humble and obscure, and yet the Magi crossed the threshold with deep emotion.
They saw a stable, dimly lit by a lamp hanging from the beams, and they remembered the prophetic sky showing the manger next to the Donkey and the Ox.
Mary, seated on sheaves, held the radiant child, half-naked in swaddling clothes, on her knees. The tender flesh of the newborn shone like a luminous flower, and the pale gold of his hair formed a halo around him.
The mother gazed at her son in silent ecstasy, and did not notice the entrance of the Magi, who had stopped at the threshold; but Joseph saw them and went towards them, greeting them and asking them what they were looking for.
- At last we have found the one we have long been looking for," they said, "the newborn star to whom the stars are in procession; and we, the fleeting kings, have come to pay homage to the sovereign whose reign will fill the centuries!
Mary then looked up and was astonished to see the three kings in their magical garments.
The old man had put on a brown robe, covered with embroidered characters in orange silk; around his neck hung a large lead medal, covered with mysterious signs. The King of Arabia wore a scarlet robe, and on his forehead was a pewter blade bearing three names of angels. The King of Sheba wore a purple robe, a shining tiara and gold bracelets on his arms, signifying the Sun and the planets of the day.
The three wise men came and knelt at Mary's feet, confused and proud, before the child, who looked up with his beautiful, vague eyes and tried to smile. Meanwhile, Joseph, embarrassed, explained that he had come to Bethlehem with Mary because of the census ordered by Caesar, but that there were so many people in the town that the inns were full and they had found no place anywhere.
The kings did not hear her; moved and delighted, they had opened their treasures; they dripped gold on the ground, they lit perfumes: frankincense and myrrh, whose light smoke rose in bluish flakes, and Mary, dreamily, bent her head and said to herself:
- The shepherds have already come, now here are kings!
And when the rites had been performed, the wise men withdrew and went to rest.
The next day they set off again for their distant kingdoms in the East, taking care not to pass through Jerusalem again, for they had guessed Herod's dark plans and did not want to see him again.

THE FOUR WISE MEN OF ARABIA
In the days when the tribes, free and wandering, pitched their tents on the golden sands of Arabia, the wild daughters of the desert were proud and fearless, gentle and tender nevertheless, esteemed and adored by men; they were their equals, and enjoyed the same rights as they did. They were allowed to repudiate their husbands, and all a woman had to do to make her husband understand that he was free was to change the orientation of the marital tent. When he approached in the evening and could no longer find the entrance in the usual place, he understood that he was no longer allowed to cross the threshold, and he left without asking for an explanation.
These women knew how to defend their virtue and considered it to be their most precious possession. They often preferred death to dishonour; witness the illustrious Fatimé, who, when taken prisoner, threw herself headfirst from the top of the camel she was riding, thus killing herself to escape the love of her conqueror.
These beautiful Arabs were often poets; they were the ones who recounted famous battles and glorious adventures, sang the praises of heroes, and scorned cowards; for them, courage was man's greatest virtue, and far from softening their audacity with tender concerns, or appeasing their anger and warlike ardour, they encouraged them, drove them into battle and inflamed them.
It is reported that one day the daughters, renowned for their beauty, of an old warrior named Find, seeing the men of their tribe weakening and hesitating in an encounter, suddenly tore off their veils, with sublime impudence, and threw themselves, half-naked, into the midst of the combatants.
naked, into the midst of the combatants.
- Do not flee, warriors," they shouted, "for we would flee from you like vile beings unworthy of love.
Precipitate on the enemy and triumph, clothe yourselves in this battle as in a garment of blood and gold.
Then it will be in our arms that you will rest in victory.
The enthusiastic warriors took up the fight again, and the tribe was victorious.
In those days, no one yet wrote, and oral tradition passed on the stories of the heroes and the songs of the poets from one generation to the next. As a result, many works have disappeared; many names have been lost to oblivion; sometimes, on the contrary, only the names are remembered.
This is partly the case with these four women who were famous enough to merit the title of the Four Wise Men of Arabia; their names are still famous today, but on the whole little is known about them. One was called Sohr, daughter of Lokman, the other Juma, daughter of Jadis, the third Amra, daughter of Amir the Just, and the last Hind, daughter of Khous. Nothing is known of Djouma and Sohr, except that they possessed a high intelligence and great wisdom, and that the accuracy of their judgement earned them general admiration.
A curious anecdote is told about Amra: his father was a judge and supreme chief of his tribe. People came to him from the furthest reaches of Arabia to submit difficult questions to his experience and wisdom. For a long time he judged with the utmost fairness, but age weakened the lucidity of his mind, and he sometimes decided unfairly.
One day Amra, who was always listening from behind a curtain to the discussion of affairs, said to his father:
- You have made a mistake today; the sentence you have passed is unjust.
- You are right, my daughter," said the old man after a few moments' reflection.
So always remain attentive, when I judge, and when you notice the lapses of my mind, strike a stick on the ground to warn me.
From that day on, when Amir heard the blow struck by his daughter, he would redouble his attention, and he was never wrong in his judgements.
This adventure gave rise to the proverb:
"The most learned man must not think himself infallible: it is not from today that the stick is struck to warn the wise."
Hind, daughter of Khous, is the most illustrious of the four, and many of her thoughts have been preserved by tradition.
It is said that she was gifted with an extraordinary sharpness of eye. She could see all the way to the horizon, and with a single glance she could take in a scene in all its minute detail.
One day, she was sitting on the sand in front of her tent with a group of young girls, playing with a familiar dove perched on her fist. Suddenly, a flock of birds flew past, high in the sky above the girls. Hind looks up and suddenly improvises these verses:
I wish I had these doves,
Plus half their number;
With the dove that coos here
That would make a hundred doves.
The birds fell a short distance away, near a puddle where they had come to drink. We approached them quietly and counted them; there were sixty-six. Sixty-six plus thirty-three
three, plus one, make a hundred; one look was enough for Hind to count the birds and recognise their species.
Her mind was no less lucid or quick than her eye, and she answered all the questions put to her without hesitation.
- Who, in your opinion, is the man most worthy of esteem?
- It's the man with a handsome face, a good body, tall and slender legs, a proud collar, a light and lively gait, the intelligent and generous man who is happy to look after the interests of others, who is asked and never asks, whose table is open to all and who never runs to anyone else's, who brings peace among his brothers and never causes a quarrel.
- And who is the worst of men?
- The man without a beard, short and stocky, with a heavy gait, the insatiable sleeper who relies on others to take care of his affairs, whose arm is weak but who always lashes out at his inferiors, the man without morals, useless and idle, whom no one listens to and no one obeys.
- And who do you think is the most desirable woman?
- The woman whose skin is clear and transparent and whose breath is fragrant; the woman who never goes beyond her front door, who is careful to keep all her vases stocked with provisions, who looks after her household and knows, when necessary, how to put water in her milk and manage the family finances; but the best of all is the woman who carries a son on her arm, whose steps are followed by a son, and who carries a third son in her womb.
- And the most detestable woman?
- She is the thin and feeble woman, with a dark complexion, a loud and shrill voice, who makes wind and dust as she walks, who holds a daughter by the hand and is only ever pregnant with a daughter; she is the woman who, when asked to speak, remains silent, and when asked to remain silent, speaks. This practical wisdom, which was one of Hind's greatest merits, did not exclude her reverie and a gentler poetry; she loved nature, space and the wild majesty of the desert.
- Nothing is more beautiful," she would exclaim, "than to catch a glimpse of a tribe on the march in the distance, on the heights, their tents bent over, their men and camels silhouetted against the sky, reddened by the setting sun!
She wrote moral reflections, maxims and descriptive poems in a nervous, colourful style that is truly remarkable.
Yet another woman deserves the glory of having freed her tribe from the infamous droit du seigneur, which a tyrant had managed to impose on them.
Ofaira, nicknamed the Retive, a noble child of the Djadis tribe, was, according to custom, handed over on her wedding night to Imlyk, who ruled as king over the descendants of Djadis. The young bride, mad with anger and despair, fled from the royal tent, and in tears, dishevelled, ran through the tribe shouting indignantly:
- Ah, sons of Djadis, what a degradation you have fallen into! Can you bear to see your fiancées, your wives, insulted in this way without dying of rage? And you are men, more numerous than ants! Ah, you are no longer worthy of living, if you do not prefer death a thousand times over this infamous submission. No, you are no longer men!
Go and get yourselves perfumed, put on women's clothes, blacken your eyes with Kh'ol and mend your clothes. We would teach you your duty, but you must know that we feel nothing but contempt and disgust for those who do not know how to proudly raise their heads and defend us.
Ofaira's brother and fiancé became the leaders of a conspiracy: Imlyk was lured into a trap and slaughtered along with all his courtiers.
LEÏLA
Keïs, son of an illustrious khan of the Amerite tribe, was a proud teenager with a handsome face, a strong arm and the heart of a hero. Many a young girl would follow him with tender sighs as he launched his fiery horse across the plains, practising his arrow-shooting and spear-wielding skills; but he remained cold and indifferent, taking no notice of the emotions he aroused.
One day, however, he overheard his comrades-in-arms talking about a young girl from a tribe camped on a nearby plain. An extraordinary emotion seized him, so much so that it made him turn pale. He walked away and repeated the name he had heard:
- Leïla!
And it seemed to him, as the Persians say, that he was drinking water from a heavenly fruit.
From then on, Keïs had only one thought: to see this young girl, whose name alone had troubled his heart for the first time.
One morning, he left his tent and, mounted on a fast-moving camel, set off towards the camp of the tribe to which Leïla belonged.
When he reached the camp, he roamed around the tents for a long time before finally spotting a group of young girls picking wild roses on the edge of a path. He dismounted and ran towards them, but they fled like a flock of sparrows, dropping the flowers they were carrying in one side of their dresses. But when they were some distance away, they stopped and turned their heads, furtive and curious, and, seeing that the man who had frightened them was handsome and young, they let him come up to them.
- Ah, young ladies, don't run away from me," cried Keïs, greeting them; "tell me, do you know Leïla?
- Of course we know her," replied the boldest.
- There isn't a woman in the whole of Iran who can compare to her.
- She is the most perfect beauty.
- The noblest of hearts.
- How could we not know her!
They were now all speaking at once, enveloping the young man in a charming circle.
- Please," he said, "take me to Leila, if you don't want to see me die here.
They nudged each other, waving at each other, thinking up some mischief.
- Follow us," they said, "it would be a shame to see such a charming lord die.
They guided him towards a richly decorated tent and, having lifted the drapes over the entrance, pushed him inside, stifling fresh bursts of laughter.
Leila was standing in the middle of the tent, wearing a garland of gold coins on her forehead, her face bent towards a mirror held before her by a kneeling slave. In the presence of this marvellous beauty, Keïs could not bear his emotion; he fell to the ground unconscious. The young girl turned round and, full of surprise, bent over Keïs.
Meanwhile, Leïla's companions were curiously poking their wild heads through the opening in the tent to see how their protégé had been received. When they saw him lying on the ground, they hurried in, suddenly serious.
- What!" they said, "Leïla, did you kill him?
- I know nothing about this young man," said Leïla. When he sighed, I looked up and saw him standing there without moving.
I thought he was wounded and being pursued by enemies. Do you know more than I do?
- We met him near the rosehips," cried the girls. If I don't see Leïla," he told us, "I'll die.
So he died because he saw you?
- Heaven forbid!" said Leïla, who was holding Keïs' beautiful head on her knee and contemplating this unknown face with growing emotion, full of a charm that was new to her. I don't know what's going on inside me," she went on
I don't know what's going on inside me," she continued, "but it seems to me that if this man, whom I've only seen for a few minutes and whose name I don't even know, doesn't come back to life, I won't be able to survive him.
- Shut up, Leïla!" said the girls, "he's listening to you.
Keïs had opened his eyes.
- Don't be surprised to be touched by my love! This is no ordinary flame, kindled little by little, it is the fire of a volcano, bursting forth suddenly and tearing the earth apart. How can you not be burnt?
- You have to believe in a tenderness that bursts forth so quickly," said Leïla, "since the same feeling has just blossomed so suddenly in my heart.
Then she asked the young prince his name and that of his tribe.
They were from two tribes that were mortal enemies: the Nadites and the Amerites had vowed implacable hatred for each other.
- Alas!" cried Leïla, "how many misfortunes threaten our love! Let's cover it with a hundred veils and hide it, as one hides a treasure when crossing a band of brigands.
Soon the two lovers were having secret meetings outside the camps, in the shade of the tall rose and palm trees. Nothing disturbed their mysterious happiness until the day when Keïs' friends, surprised by his frequent absences, spied on him and reported him to the prince, his father.
The chief of the Amerites, inflamed with anger, forbade his son to leave his tent and had him guarded by soldiers, who were responsible for the prisoner's life.
Keïs, in the grip of the fiercest despair, first tried to escape; but feeling powerless, he dropped into a corner like an inert mass and remained there, refusing to eat.
The friends who had betrayed his secret, out of interest in him and fear that he might be massacred by the Nadites, came to visit him.
- Dear Keïs," they said, "can we do nothing to help you?
- If you are my friends," Keïs replied in a deaf voice, "tell Leïla that I am in the flames of hell, but that I will never stop worshipping her, and that she should beware of accusing me of ingratitude; then go to my father and ask him to grant me permission to make a pilgrimage to Mecca.
The friends complied with the messages and, the prince having granted his son's wish, Keïs set off immediately for the holy place; several soldiers accompanied him and, secretly, the prince, his father, followed him.
When he had reached the end of the long and arduous journey, Keïs prostrated himself and began his prayer aloud, with such an accent of fervour and despair that all the pilgrims who were also praying fell silent and listened to him.
- O mighty God!" he moaned, "I am crushed under my pain like a gnat under a rock, and yet I live to endure unheard-of tortures. If you are not going to remove the weight from my chest, take me out of this world, for hell itself is preferable to such a life. My soul is shattered into a thousand pieces, all suffering and screaming; will you not hear this wail, more terrible than that of the damned? Will you leave the work of your hands in such torture? Behold, the breath passes through my lips like a devouring flame, each of my hairs weeps a drop of blood, my eyes are full of the sand of the desert, and my spirit is like flesh burnt alive. Have mercy on me, O merciful God, give me back Leïla or send me death!
When he stood up, Keïs saw his father beside him; the prince clasped his son in his arms and wept.
- Beloved child," he said, "forgive me for having caused you pain; I wanted what was best for you, and I didn't know that love was so deeply rooted in your heart. But I want to right the wrong I have done: I will go to the chief of the Nadites and, if I can overcome his hatred, I will bring your fiancée back to you.
- Ah, my father!" cried Keïs, "today is the day you give me my life.
The prince did indeed leave for the camp of the Nadites, and Keïs waited anxiously for his return; but he saw him return alone, his face flushed with anger.
- Oh, my unfortunate son," he cried, "as long as Leïla's father lives, Leïla is lost to you!
Keïs was like a tree struck by lightning, which remains standing even though the sap has been reduced to ashes; he stood in the same place for a long time, his eyes haggard, with all the appearance of a madman; then, suddenly, like a wounded gazelle taking the deadly arrow with it, he fled into the desert.
Many months passed without any relief for his pain; he wandered the plains, the mountains, the deserts, living off roots, fleeing the society of men. He became known only as Medjnoun (the Fool).
One day, the young and powerful prince of Naufel passed by Keïs on his way back from hunting, and was moved by his deep sorrow.
- Is there no remedy for your suffering?" he said to him, "is hope completely dead in your heart?
Keïs shook his head despondently.
- Listen," said Naufel, "your beloved's father is the chief of a tribe that is friendly to the one I rule. But my tribe is twice as powerful as his. I will go to this cruel man and threaten him with a bitter war if he does not grant you his daughter as your wife.
- Don't play with the heart of a wretch," said Keïs, whose eyes became wet with tears.
The prince took him with him, and soon afterwards they went together to the Nadite camp. Keïs, whose face was unknown, was able to slip into the women's quarter and reach Leïla's tent.
The young girl was in the midst of her companions, who tried to distract her from her grief, but she wept as she rejected their consolations.
- O you who have never experienced the torments of love," she moaned, "how can you have compassion on my sufferings?
Only those who have suffered can pity and understand me. With a healthy and whole heart, oh my friends, you would never know how sick and torn mine is. What's the point of talking about bees to those who haven't felt their sting? But at least don't compare the love that devours me to other frivolous loves; other people's loves are like salt in your hand, and I have salt sprinkled on my raw wounds.
Keïs, shattered by emotion, had dropped to his knees at the entrance to the tent.
- Allah!" he cried, "all my desires were for my beloved.
Her absence was for me like a devouring flame, and now, at the moment of seeing her again, my strength fails me and I tremble with fear.
On hearing this voice, Leïla shrieked and immediately went outside.
She dragged Keïs into her tent, and the two of them fell back onto the cushions, suffocated by emotion, unable to say a word, and thinking no more of complaining about their past sufferings and the harshness of fate.
But Prince Naufel soon came to tear them apart: the Khan of the Nadites was implacable.
- At the first move of your army," he had said, "Leïla will be dead, killed by my hands; you may have victory, but you will not defeat my will.
They had to flee, to come back later and take Leïla, before starting the war.
They left and, a few days later, a messenger was sent to Leila to agree with her the day and means of escape.
The messenger returned with this terrible news: Leïla was married and the husband was taking his young wife away.
But in a letter she told Keïs that, despite this new twist of fate, she would remain faithful to him and that she would kill herself before belonging to another man.
The unfortunate lover fled again into the desert; he resumed his wandering life, became Medjnoun again, the fool for love, and long, sad days passed for him. Those who saw him were terrified, he became legendary, and people said of him:
"His flanks are withered and thin, his clothes are worn out, his shirt is in tatters, and all he has to cover himself with are the veils of the night. He is so terrible to behold that, during the day and afterwards, people everywhere flee from him, and even when he interrupts his desolate journeys, they are still alarmed."
Finally, Leïla's husband died from the grief caused him by the aversion and resistance of his beautiful wife.
This good news was announced to Medjnoun who, to everyone's surprise, began to weep over the fate of this unhappy husband.
- He's decidedly mad," said the messengers, "here he is, weeping over something that should bring him back to life.
- Surely," said Medjnoun, "this man is to be pitied, for he has known the torments of love.
Leïla ran to Keïs, but he didn't even get up from the stone on which he was sitting.
- O beloved! Don't you recognise me?" she said, full of terror.
- I recognise you, Leïla," replied Medjnoun, "but what's the point of uniting us in this world? My love has grown so great that it has crossed the limits of the earth, my desire is so vast that nothing could satisfy it; the earthly Leïla is not the one who suits the divine love that sets me on fire.
- Alas!" said Leïla, weeping, "he is mad!
- No," said Medjnoun in a gentle voice, growing paler by the minute, "but by dint of contemplating the heaven of my love, my eyes have become blinded and can no longer see the earth. Heaven, Leïla, is where our eternal wedding will take place!
A few moments later, Keïs died in the arms of his beloved, who did not survive him.
loved one, who only survived him by a few days.
Thus ended the Romeo and Juliet of the East. The two lovers were buried in a magnificent tomb, shaded by a grove of rose bushes.
TOUMADIR THE SOLAMIDE
One day, a literary meeting was held at the home of the Khalif Abd-el-Melik
el-Melik, who reigned just one century before Haroun-el-Rachid; a famous poet named Cha-by was present.
- Who, in your opinion, is the most remarkable female poet of paganism?" asked the khalife.
- Lord," replied Cha-by, "it's Toumadir the Solamide.
- Why do you put her first?
- Was it not she who said: "All must suffer death, death so capricious in its blows. O strange and cruel destiny!
O Sakhr! O my brother! you have left, you have gone to drink from this reserve of water, whose bitterness all will one day taste."
- But," continued Abd-el-Melik, "perhaps she is even more of a poet, the one who said of the man ravaged by an unhappy love: "His sides are parched and thin, his clothes are worn out, his shirt is in tatters; all he has to cover himself and hide behind are the veils of the night. He is so terrible to behold that, during the day and after the day, people everywhere flee from him, and even when he interrupts his desolate journeys, they are still alarmed.
These verses are by the amorous Leïla," continued the khalife, "and I prefer them to those of Toumadir.
Cha-by didn't dare reply, but he continued to give preference, apart from himself, to Toumadir.
This woman was from the Beni-Solaim or Solamides tribe, and had been nicknamed Khansâ, i.e. the Camuse, because of her prominent forehead, which made her nose look depressed. She had married one of the chiefs of the Solamides, named Mirdès, but she remained a widow after a few years of marriage. Toumadir had two brothers, Moavia and Sakhr, whom she loved dearly; they both died tragically, and the pain of this double loss inspired the young woman to write her most beautiful poems.
Moavia, the elder of the two brothers, saw a beautiful young girl from the Mourrid tribe pass by one day during a solemn festival attended by several tribes. He mistook her for a promiscuous woman, called out to her and invited her to accompany him.
- Do you not know," replied the young girl angrily, "that I am under the protection of the illustrious chief Hashem, son of Harmala?
- What do I care?" cried Moavia, carried away by passion, "I'll know how to take you away from him!
The beautiful Murrid fled and went to tell Hashem about her adventure.
- Let him come," cried the chief, "and I swear he won't leave our tribe alive.
The challenge was reported to Moavia, and some time later he led an expedition against the Murrids. Toumadir's brother was advancing at the head of his small troop when, just as he reached enemy territory, a raven flew overhead, cawing, while a gazelle crossed the road in front of the horsemen, from left to right. It was a double harbinger of doom; all were stopped, and Moavia ordered his troop to turn back. But he and some of his companions stopped near a water reservoir to give their horses something to drink. A woman saw them, recognised them and hurried off to warn the chief of the Mourrids. Soon a troop of warriors swooped down on the Solamids; Hashem was among them; he rushed at Moavia and pierced him with a spear; another knocked him down and split his head open.
Moavia's body was brought back to the tribe, and Toumadir, distraught with grief, improvised the following song:
"What, such a death has befallen us, and the mounts of Tiar are still standing! and the universe remains as it was!
"Was there a man in all the tribes comparable to Moavia? Was he a horseman like the horseman who drank from the water tank of the old treacherous woman? Who then can be compared to my brother, when boldness and intrepidity prevailed?
"When the ardour of war brought men face to face, when the furious battle rolled up the long coats of mail to the skulls of the warriors,
"There was none braver, none more devoted to the salvation of his brothers. Ah! the tears shed for you, Moavia, will never dry up. My sobs and cries of pain will never cease!
Toumadir kept her word; she never stopped weeping for her brother and later composed the following poem:
"What's wrong with your eyes, O Khansa? What! your eyelids are flooded with tears!
"May the stars fade, may the sun cease to shine, he is no more, the son of Amr, the offspring of noble blood!
"His voice no longer vibrates; he who sang so many rhymes, piercing as spearheads. They live among us, these poems, and he who spoke them lives no more!
"O Moavia! the Mourrids have killed you; but how many of their horsemen have fallen under your blows!
"How many women, as beautiful and white as the dawn, you have saved in the midst of battle, as they wandered about, their sails in disarray, frightened by the melee!
"How many fine camels did you take from the enemy?
How you chased them before you on your mount, stabbing them with your sword!
"How many desolate captives you led before you in troops, like beautiful antelopes stirred by the first drops of rain!
"Moavia, there can be no pain under heaven like mine!
Sakhr, Amr's youngest son, wanted to avenge his brother's death; he attacked the Mourrids and slaughtered many of them.
We greeted them mortally at dawn," he exclaimed, "and our spears went all the way to their heads.
and our spears were sheathed in their blood up to the shaft.
"But I want to reduce this tribe to the barks; we will kill some of these Mourrides, we will crush them until there is not one left.
But it was a young rider from a friendly tribe who killed Hashem, Moavia's murderer. Toumadir was grateful and wrote the following verses to him:
"I would give my life, and the lives of all those dear to me, to reward you, beautiful Djushamide rider.
"For by avenging my brother, you have refreshed my tear-stricken eyes, which could no longer sleep or let others sleep.
Sakhr was later mortally wounded in a battle that became known as the Day of the Tamarins. He was hit in the side with a spear, and as the iron penetrated the wound, it pulled a ring of chain mail into the wound. The wound became irritated and a tumour formed, and the wounded man languished for almost a year in the cruellest pain. Eventually, his wife, Selma, grew tired of him and loathed him. Sakhr's mother, on the other hand, looked after her son with the most tender and patient solicitude. One day, from his bed of pain, the wounded Sakhr heard a stranger ask his wife:
- How is your husband? - Alas, what shall I tell you?" cried Selma; "he is neither a living man for whom we can hope, nor a dead man for whom we can weep. He is a man of bitterness.
It was then that the sad wounded man improvised the following verses:
"The mother does not tire of caring for her child, but here is the wife, already bored with her husband's bed and home.
"Go, I am not afraid of becoming a corpse, and if I had the strength, I would finish myself off so that you could mourn me.
"Ah, Selma, you have awakened me from my sleep, you have opened my eyes to yourself.
"You have shown me that death is sweeter than life. I go, but may every man who esteems his wife as his mother find only days of misery and contempt!"
The unfortunate man, in despair, asked for his sword, on the pretext of seeing if he could still carry it. He was unable to lift the weapon, which slipped from his hands. He then allowed himself to undergo an operation that he knew would hasten his death, and he said to the grieving Toumadir:
"Dear sister, suffering has a thousand forms in this world, happiness is a small thing.
"Henceforth, for me, no more races, no more journeys, no more battles, but my memory will last as long as Mount Acib lasts.
He died and was buried in the territory of his tribe, at the foot of Mount Acib.
Toumadir saw the floodgates of his tears open again, and poured out his grief in new poems.
Alas!" she cried, "she who weeps bitterly, weeps for a brother separated from her by a veil of earth.
"In the house, widowed of her children, I wring my arms and moan.
"No, the she-camel deprived of her new-born camel, who cries out in tenderness and despair, who is no longer fattened in any pasture and, mad with grief, goes and searches on all sides,
"Gives but a faint image of the sorrow with which I have been overwhelmed since Sakhr left me. Alas! alas! time has its sweet days and its bitter days.
"Sakhr was the master, the ruler of our tribes; for all, he slaughtered his flocks in the hard days of winter.
"When cold and need drove the traveller's camels to run to the first shelter, and hunger made their ribs protrude,
"In those days, the guests who came down to Sakhr's house always found the table ready and the food boiling.
"Ah! now that he is no more, who will take in the stranger, when those terrible winds blow from the north, their whistling making the echoes tremble?
"Let the mourning tribe remember your virtues, O Sakhr, and mourn you unceasingly, for you were their hero.
Toumadir's verve never waned when it came to singing about his beloved dead. His poetry always revolved around the same subject. Let us quote another elegy, the most famous, which has become part of public song:
"Flow, oh my tears, flow unceasingly, has not the most generous of men lain in the dust?
"Is he not gone forever, the man of courage and beauty, the hero of the tribe?
"The hero with the long harness and the waist like a slender pillar, the man who was king of our tents before the beard curled on his chin?
"All men stretch out their arms to glory, he too stretched out his hands to it; but he reached beyond the height of all, and, having surpassed it, he rose again.
"When danger fell upon our tribes, it was in him that they placed their hope, in him, still so young, so new to life.
"So the most illustrious of our Solamids mourn the gentle hero, and tears flood their beards.
"And the young women, who accompanied the leafy stretcher on which my brother lay, cried out: 'Woe!
woe! Sakhr is no more.
"Oh that they had died in the cradle, those who would later lead him to this untimely grave!
Toumadir saw the rise of Islamism and even embraced the new faith. In the year 8 of the Hegira, Abbas, her son, supreme chief of the Solamids, came at the head of his tribe to make his submission to the Prophet. Toumadir was presented to Muhammad and recited verses to him. He received her with honour, congratulating her on her talent and her great fame.
Later, when Mohammed wanted to quote one of Toumadir's verses, he showed how little he understood the rules of prosody: he distorted the measure, changed the place of the words and completely crippled the verse. Abu-Bekr, who noticed his master's error, repeated the verse as it should have been.
- What does it matter?" said Mahomet, "it's all the same.
- Certainly," continued Abu-Bekr, "you justify these words, which God revealed in his holy Koran: 'We did not teach our Prophet versification; he has no need of it. The Koran is simply a teaching, a simple and clear reading.
MAHOMET'S FAVOURITE
The Prophet had returned victorious from an expedition against the Mostaliks; on the last evening they had camped a short distance from Medina and had set off again before daylight.
Just as the sun slipped its first rays over the countryside from the edge of the sky, it caused the chain mail and spear of a latecomer to sparkle, as he urged his camel on with his voice. He was a young warrior, well-built and of good appearance under the light damascene helmet; but he seemed very upset to have stayed behind: in his deep sleep, he had not heard the signal to leave, and had just woken up alone in the abandoned camp. He makes every effort to catch up with the army. Hup! hup! the camel stretches out its neck and throws its gnarled legs backwards and forwards, seeming to want to leave its body: but, suddenly, the young man pulls on the bridle, stopping the animal with a cry of surprise.
He had just seen a woman, wrapped in veils, sitting on a stone, elbow on knee, chin in hand; and he thought he recognised her.
He quickly retraced his steps, approached her, and she raised her head towards him, revealing two moist eyes between clouds of gauze.
- It's Aishah, the prophet's wife!
- Alas, my veil is like crystal for your eyes, Safivân, son of Moattal," said Aïchah. How is it that you recognised me at first sight?
Safivân slid off his horse.
- Before the Koran forbade women to allow themselves to be seen by strangers," he said, "you know I'd had my first glimpse of you on several occasions.
- But under the wall of muslin, one woman is indistinguishable from another.
- Do you think that on other shoulders the folds of the veil would have as much grace? said Safivân in a moved voice. Do you know eyes that, like yours, mix the fire of the sun with the shadows of the night?
Aïchah turned her head sharply away, and the young man, regretting what he had said, lowered his eyes to the ground.
After a disturbing silence, he continued:
- Will you deign to tell me why you have been so cruelly abandoned?
- I confide in you," said Aïchah; "listen to my strange adventure. As you know, when God's apostle sets out on a journey, he usually chooses one of his wives to accompany him by lot. This time, fate favoured me, and I went with him. Since the Koran imposed the duty of hiding from the eyes of men, I travel in a closed litter carried by a camel. When the army is encamped, the litter is put on the ground to take me out; I go back in when they leave, and two slaves lift it up and place it effortlessly on the camel, thin and light as I am. That night, as they were packing up the luggage to set off, I took a few quick steps to warm up, as I was shivering from the cold. On my way back, I noticed that a necklace made of Zhafar onyx, which is very dear to me, had fallen from my neck. I went back to look for it, and wasted time in this search; finally, having found my necklace, I hurried back to the camp. Then I saw no one, the army having set off. The servants in charge of my camel had placed the litter on its back, thinking I was in it, and had taken the animal away. I shouted and called out, but no one answered, so, wrapping myself in my veil, I sat down where you found me, hoping that my absence would soon be discovered and that they would come looking for me.
Safivân made his camel kneel down:
- Mount up, daughter of Abu-Bekr," he said, "and deign to accept as your guide the most respectful of your slaves.
- Perhaps it would be better if I waited," said Aïchah hesitantly.
- Are you thinking about it? Some rude man might meet you and insult you.
The young man turned away while Aishah got into the saddle; then he took the animal by the bridle and led it along the gentlest path, in silence, without looking up at the prophet's wife.
They were only able to rejoin the army at the morning halt, and all those who saw the handsome warrior riding the steed of a veiled woman were greatly surprised.
Some of them recognised Aïchah, and when they had passed behind the dust raised by the camel's feet, whispers buzzed; people speculated: how had they both stayed behind? how did they come back together?
It wasn't clear, or rather it was too clear; but Aïchah and her guide passed through the ranks of soldiers and tents without hearing the muffled rumours, without seeing the sly irony of the glances that followed them.
Back in Medina, Safivân was dreamily saddened by this adventure; the young woman forgot all about him, and neither of them suspected the storm that was gathering around them.
A month later, Aïchah was in the harem, receiving a friend who had come to visit her. The two of them, half reclining on cushions, were nibbling on sweets served to them by their favourite slave, Bouraïra. But the visitor was preoccupied; her long black eyebrows furrowed at every moment, and flashes of anger passed through her eyes. Suddenly, she pushed away the sorbet offered to her, crying out:
- Damn Mistah!
- How can you wish ill on a warrior who fought valiantly in Bedr for the cause of God?
- In what retirement do you live, daughter of Abu-Bekr? Is it possible that you know nothing of the slanders that Mistah has spread about you, and which are the subject of all the conversations!
- What do you mean?" cried Aïchah, rising to her feet, pale and trembling, "what slander can they spread against me?
- They say you betrayed your husband, and that your accomplice is Safivân, son of Moattal; the most determined to accuse you are Hamna, daughter of Djateh, Hassan, Abdallah, and several others from the Khazradi trihu.
At that moment, Oumm-Rouman, Aïchah's mother, entered the room.
- God forgive you!" cried the young woman, running to her in tears. What! They're tearing my reputation to shreds and you don't warn me!
- Calm down, my daughter," said Oumm-Rouman, "it's very rare that a young, beautiful woman like you, her husband's favourite and who has several rivals, escapes the attacks of slander.
- Unfortunately," said the visitor, "everyone knows that Safivân was in love with her before Aïchah's marriage, and that he almost died of grief when she was lost to him.
- Is the Prophet aware of this horrible accusation?
asked Aïchah.
- We don't know, he doesn't talk about it; perhaps he doesn't know," said Oumm-Rouman.
- Oh, yes, yes, he knows!" cried the young woman, wringing her hands; "that's why he's been so cold to me for some time now. I thought that another of his wives was turning the master's love away from me, and I asked God for resignation; but now I see clearly: he thinks I'm guilty, he's thinking of repudiating me!
The sound of rapid footsteps was heard, and Abu-Bekr rushed into the harem so quickly that the visitor had no time to hide. He was out of breath, his face flushed.
- Ah, my daughter! a terrible scandal at the mosque!" he said in a broken voice; "you're lost!
The three women, appalled, questioned him.
Then he recounted how the Prophet, mortified by the slanderous noises that kept coming into his ears, had gone up to the pulpit and said:
- Muslims, people are saying things that hurt me. How can they allow themselves to attack a member of my household, whose conduct has always been irreproachable, and a man of whom I have never had anything but praise?
Immediately several chiefs rose from the crowd, some to defend Aïchah, others to accuse him; they exchanged violent words, challenged each other and came to blows. With great difficulty, God's Apostle came down from the pulpit, calmed the tumult and, declaring that he wanted to put an end to the affair with a definitive decision, called Aly, his cousin, and went with him to Aishah's house to judge her.
- I've taken a shorter route," added an overwhelmed Abu-Bekr, "and in all haste I've come to warn you; but I'm only a few minutes ahead of them and I can't avert the blow that threatens you.
- Even when condemned, the innocent must not bow his head," said the Prophet's wife proudly.
The master had already crossed the threshold of the house. Aly drew aside a curtain and called the young maid, Bouraïra, in for questioning.
- Alas! they are going to torture her!" cried Aïchah, when she saw that Aly was armed with a whip.
Soon, in fact, the terrible cries of the unfortunate slave were heard.
They wanted to know from her whether Safivân had had any previous intimate relations with Aïchah. She declared that her mistress had never failed in her duties, and despite the blows that Aly dealt her to extract a confession, she persisted in her testimony.
Mahomet then entered the harem. He was very pale and his lips trembled slightly.
The accused had thrown herself on the sofa and was weeping, leaning on her friend's shoulder. He came and sat down beside her and said:
- Praise be to God, the Master of the Universe, the Clement, the Merciful! Then he said: "Do you know, Aishah, the rumours that are circulating against you? If you have committed a fault, confess it with a repentant heart; God is forgiving and forgives repentance.
Aïchah made a violent effort to stop her sobs.
- I've done nothing to repent of," she said; "if I accused myself, I'd be lying to my conscience. If I accused myself, I'd be lying to my conscience. On the other hand, no matter how much I denied what I was accused of, they wouldn't believe me.
In that position, I would do as...
She stopped; the name of Jacob that she was looking for escaped her, so confused was she.
- I'll say what Joseph's father said," she continued. Be patient, and God help me!
At that moment, the Prophet was seized by one of those fainting spells that often preceded his revelations. He turned livid and lost consciousness. He was wrapped in a cloak, Aishah put a cushion under his head and everyone remained silent. The young woman felt no alarm while he was thus in communication with the heavenly messenger; but her father and mother, what frightful trances were chilling them! It was as if they were going to die for fear that heaven would confirm the accusation made against their daughter.
After a few moments, Mohammed came to; he wiped his brow, which was covered in sweat even though it was winter, and looked at Aishah, smiling.
- Rejoice," he said, "your innocence has been revealed to me from on high.
- God be praised!" she cried, "He has deigned to defend a weak and unworthy creature like me.
The Prophet immediately left the house and recited to the Muslims the verses of the Koran that he had just received from heaven.
The verses in question can be found in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Koran. They begin as follows:
"Those who accuse a virtuous woman of adultery, without being able to produce four witnesses, will be punished with eighty lashes; moreover, you will never again admit their testimony in anything whatsoever, for they are perverse".
This oracle put an end to the discussion. The confounded accusers became the object of general reprobation, after having suffered the punishment. No further slander tarnished Aishah's reputation, and the Prophet remained deeply attached to his favourite wife until his death.
THE KHALIFE'S SEVERITY
Across the bazaar, full of bustle and noise, between the stalls of the butchers, the fruit merchants and the confectioners, a man dressed in a patched robe and wearing a turban of dark cloth, moved about, holding in his hand a flexible stick with which he played nervously, tapping the folds of his robe, striking the air here and there, as if he were inflicting corrections on invisible culprits. Two young men, very plainly dressed, followed the first, looking grave and respectful.
The crowd moved aside in front of the three strollers, following them with fearful glances, and, as long as they were in sight, merchants and buyers remained silent. Everyone recognised the Khalif Omar, who had come, as was his custom, to police the bazaar and the town incognito, accompanied by his two sons.
- Hey, butcher, have you given up fiddling with your weights and scales, or do we have to repeat the punishment?" shouted the Khalif to a fat man, whose crimson face suddenly turned pale.
But Omar turned his back and, seeing a milkmaid in her modest shop, called out to her:
- Woman," he said, "I have already warned you that you must not put water in your milk.
- Prince of believers", replied the milkmaid, "I can assure you that I didn't put any water in it.
- How dare you, my mother!" exclaimed a young girl who was measuring the milk, as if in spite of herself.
Omar smiled and walked away without saying anything more to the milkmaid, judging that she had been punished enough by her daughter's reproach; but he turned back to his sons:
- Here," he said, "is a young girl whom Allah has perfumed with his graces; he will give her virtuous offspring like her.
Which of you is willing to take her as his wife?
- I will marry her," said Akim, the youngest of Omar's sons.
The Khalifa continued his tour and soon left the city and went to a brickworks.
There he took off his tunic and, mingling with the workers, began to knead the clay into bricks.
At that time, the Khalifes were poor and honest; they did not yet divert a single denarius from the public treasury for their own use and worked for a living at the job they knew how to do, during the hours left to them by the care of the State.
So Omar made bricks.
While he was busy in this way, envoys from an important town came to complain to him about a cadi who had been unjust in several cases. The khalif, his hands gloved with clay, listened attentively to the accusation, checked the evidence and, taking a brick that was still soft, wrote on it with the tip of his finger the dismissal of the cadi, handed the brick to the messengers, whom he dismissed; then he continued his work.
When the day was over, he did his ablutions on the banks of a wadi, and returned to Mecca with his two sons.
⁂
The setting sun glinted on the battlements of the ramparts, the breeze was cool and the hour was delightful.
Just as he was about to cross the drawbridge into the town, Omar saw the body of a man lying on the side of a ditch.
- Is he asleep? Is he dead?" he asked as he stopped.
The Khalifa's sons approached the motionless body.
- He is dead, Prince of the Believers.
- And murdered," said Akim.
He was a very young man, still beardless, with a soft velvety cheek; he was half naked, and on his white chest, close to his heart, the gaping lips of a wound seemed to be asking for vengeance.
- Allah!" cried the Khalifa, "I vow never to let the murder of a Muslim go unpunished. He will be avenged.
He called in the guards from the bastion, had the corpse removed and ordered a meticulous investigation to begin immediately, to discover the traces and the perpetrator of the crime; then he continued on his way, angry and sombre.
It was getting dark and you could hardly see in the narrow streets.
Suddenly there were moans and sighs that could move the coldest heart.
- What is it now?" said the Khalifa, listening intently.
The cries were coming through the moucharabi of an elegant house.
- It's a woman's voice," said Abd-Allah.
- In the midst of her tears she is speaking," said Akim. A woman always speaks.
They listened.
- Ah! give me wine, so that I can smother my pain in drunkenness, losing my mind and my memory! I live in the flames of a pyre, my heart is an inferno that devours me, extinguish it with wine, since Nazare, son of Hadjadj, the only balm that would refresh me, is not near me. I am drunk, drunk with love, for the most beautiful of men. Alas! to have seen his divine face and not to see it again is like being plunged into a dayless dungeon after having seen the sun. To be loved by Nazareth is to have one's share of heaven on earth!
- Who lives in this house?" asked the Khalifa to a passer-by.
The passer-by shrugged his shoulders:
- Are you listening to the complaints of the amorous Karia?" he said, "The echoes are tired of hearing them. The master of this house is Murirah, son of Choa.
- A married woman!" cried Omar angrily.
He returned to the palace and ordered Nazareh, son of Hadjadj, to be fetched from the city and brought to him the next day.
Nazare was at home, near his mother, when he was fetched to bring him before the Khalifa.
- What does the Prince of the Faithful want with me?" asked the young man.
- We're not here to find out," replied the envoys.
Nazare went to the khalif, and his mother, worried, followed him.
It was audience time. Omar was surrounded by a large assembly when the handsome young man appeared before him. As soon as he appeared, there was a silence of admiration; all eyes, captivated by this marvellous work of God, could not take their eyes off her. Omar himself was stunned at the sight of such beauty, nobility and grace.
Far from being touched by it, however, he became even more irritated and called out to the young man in a stern voice:
- Who are you, then, that the honest women, from the depths of the sacred harem, call and covet with cries and tears?
- I am Nazareth, son of Hadjadj; my life is pure and blameless.
- How could you never have had a mother! It was Iblis who put that radiance and magic in your eyes, that majesty on your forehead; it was he who rolled and polished, for the perdition of women, the curls of that superb hair that frames your face so marvellously. By Allah! I want to strip you, at least, of this too rich finery!
Omar immediately sent for a barber: the beautiful hair, soft and fragrant, fell under the razor. Nazare, sad and proud, submitted without resistance. But when the operation was over, he appeared even more ravishing than before to the astonished audience.
- Certainly!" exclaimed the khalif with an ironic laugh, "you look even better than before! This cut hair, like a veil being removed, has revealed new charms.
- Why do you mock me so, Emir of the Believers? What fault have I committed to be treated so harshly?
- Ah! the fault would be mine, I would really be a criminal, if I let a man live in the Holy City who has made women lose all modesty in this way: I order you to leave Mecca and never to return. The camel that is to take you to Basra is waiting for you in the courtyard.
At that moment, Nazare's mother came forward in tears:
- Successor to the Prophet!" she cried, "one day we shall both be in the presence of Allah, the Most High. He will ask you for an account of the lives of your sons Abd-Allah and Akim: he will ask you if they spent their days and nights close to you. Then I will say to him: "He has put deserts and valleys between me and my child, while he was enjoying the sight of his sons.
- My sons are not beautiful; women do not call them with cries of love," replied the Khalifa abruptly.
- Because a woman has sung her desires, can we exile a man on whom there is not even a hint of guilt?
- Enough!" said the Khalifa, his eyebrows furrowed. Let him leave at once! As long as I have power, he will not return here.
⁂
Omar then asked about the case of the murdered teenager, and whether the culprit had been found. He was told that it had been impossible to discover the faintest clue: no one knew the victim, no one was asking for him. The master wanted the search to continue unabated; they obeyed, but the following days and months brought no discovery. The Khalifa, very concerned that this crime should go unpunished, despite his oath, did not want to give up hope of finding the murderer.
At the end of that same year, a newborn child was brought to him, which had been laid on the very spot where the body had been found.
- Ah, thank God," exclaimed Omar, "I am now in control of the criminal.
He sent for a nurse and entrusted her with the child, advising her to take good care of him and to take frequent walks with him in the public gardens.
- Now, listen carefully to my words", he added, "if any person comes to you to examine this child, ask you to let them take him for a moment; if you meet a woman who kisses him and holds him in her arms, come and tell me in great secrecy".
The nurse promised to obey and left, taking the newborn child with her.
baby.
She cared for him lovingly, and the child blossomed like a flower of extreme beauty. One day, as she was walking along, holding him on her arm, the nurse saw a slave girl approaching who, without hesitation, approached her.
- My mistress saw this child on her balcony," she said, "and she thought he was so pretty that she asked you to let him come and stay with her for a while. It will brighten up her solitude. I'll bring him back to you soon.
- I agree to follow you," replied the nurse, "but I'm not leaving my child.
The slave led her to a sumptuous house and introduced her to the harem. A beautiful young girl, with a proud and noble air, was waiting for them. When she saw the child, she was overcome with emotion; she drew him close to her, took him on her lap, kissed his hair and spoke a thousand kind words to him; the most delicate delicacies were prepared for him and, when she had to leave him, the young girl clasped him to her bosom, shedding a few tears.
On her way out, the nurse made enquiries about the inhabitants of the house and immediately went to make her report to the Khalifa.
The girl's name was Saleha; her father was a revered scheik who had known and followed the Prophet as a devoted disciple.
Omar, sure he had the culprit, took his sword, which he hid under his clothes, and went to the scheik's house. He found him sitting on a carpet by the fountain in the inner courtyard.
- How is your daughter Saleha?
- Prince of believers, it is a great honour for her to occupy your mind: it is the reward, no doubt, for her piety and exemplary conduct, the fame of which will have reached you.
- That's it," said the Khalifa, "and I would like to have a meeting with her, to urge her to persevere in her virtuous deeds and to always set an example for her sex.
- May God grant you long life," replied the scheik; "stay here a while, I'll tell my daughter.
Shortly afterwards, the Khalifa entered the women's flat.
Saleha, who had veiled herself, came forward to greet him.
Around her were her slaves.
- Keep all these girls away," said Omar.
Saleha, a little trembling, motioned to the slaves to leave.
As soon as they were alone, the Khalifa drew his naked sword from under his cloak.
- You murdered your lover and abandoned your son; twice guilty, you must atone for your crimes.
The young girl abruptly tore off her veil and showed a pale, proud face, her beautiful eyes shining with tears of indignation.
- How dare you decide, knowing nothing about either the victim or the culprit? Yes, you've found what you were looking for. I killed a man, I abandoned my son. And I've committed no crime.
- I'm listening," said Omar, sitting down on the sofa. But remember, if you've never told a lie, a lie won't fool you.
Saleha wiped away her tears, leaned against the wall and crossed her arms over her breast.
- I don't know how to lie," she said, "and I have nothing to hide. Judge -
prince of believers.
Since I was a child, I had known a friend of my mother's, a serious and good woman who loved me tenderly and treated me as if I were her daughter. I adored this woman, pampered her and obeyed her in everything. One day, she came to tell me with sorrow that she was obliged to undertake a journey that would last several years. In addition to the sadness of leaving me, she was worried about leaving her daughter, whom she loved so much, unprotected. I am a widow," she said, "I have no parents. To whom can I entrust this innocent young girl, if not to you? I want to bring her to you, so I can leave in peace.
- Why haven't I been your daughter's friend for a long time?
I said to her, "Why have you never spoken to me about her? - She was too young and finishing her education, now you will know her. She left me and soon returned with her daughter. She-
She kissed me gently and asked me to be her sister. I replied that it was already so, since her mother had been my mother. We soon became friends, lived in complete intimacy and slept in the same room.
Alas! one night, while I was asleep, someone crept into my bed, and before I could recognise myself, I knew the awful truth: the deceiver I thought was a girl was a young man!
He drowned out my cries with his lips; he overcame my distraught resistance with the strength of his arms: he disgraced me. But I managed to reach a dagger hanging on the wall and plunged it into his heart. I then called in my devoted servants, who swore me to silence, and I had the corpse removed and thrown in the place where you found it. Later, the child, conceived in shame and secret tears, was carried to the same place. Successor to the Prophet, this is the truth. I kept all the pain to myself, but I saved the honour of the house. Am I a criminal in your eyes?
- The criminal is the one you punished as he deserved to be punished! cried Omar, rising to his feet. I can feel it, you've told me the truth. I admire your virtue and your courage: you have hushed up the scandal, you have spared your old father the grief of dishonour.
Persevere always in good deeds and God will shower his graces on you and admit you to his paradise.
The Khalifa wished Saleha well and then left.
In the courtyard he found the old scheik.
- Your daughter is the honour of her sex," he said, "she is virtuous as well as wise. I was looking for a woman worthy of bringing up a young orphan I had taken in; I chose her. Raised by her, my protégé will become a hero. I'll send the child to you tomorrow.
- He will be received as a gift from God," says the scheik, "he will be the joy of my old age.
- May Allah's blessing be upon you!" said Omar, waving goodbye.
ALY THE FAIR
I
- What do you want, woman? The Evil One walks with her who runs out of the harem after sunset, and the thickness of the veil does not replace lost modesty.
Aly's face was stern, but the woman threw herself on her knees, her hands clasped, her arms twisted, her elbows on the sofa.
- For a woman who has lost everything, there's no sparing her," she cried; "let her at least save her soul!
Hearing this poignant complaint, this sincere accent of despair, Aly put down the calam, still wet with ink, and the parchment on which he had traced mysterious characters.
- Speak, woman, speak your pain.
She threw back her veil, revealing a charming young face flooded with tears.
- I have no right to hide my redness," she said, "nor to conceal features that have been seen by more than one person.
Aly, gentle and cold, looked at her. She sobbed, then stiffened and wiped her eyes with her veil.
- My venerable husband," she said, "I have betrayed him. The tempter came, in the most seductive guise; he begged, he wept; it was as if he were going to die, deprived of me; his words were so soft, so trembling, that they made my heart fail. Then they became hot and devouring like the burning simoun of the desert; their breath dried me up, burnt me, altered me irresistibly with the freshness of kisses, and, like the long-lost caravan rushing, panic-stricken with thirst, to the spring of the oasis, I drank, I drank the poison of his love!
- What do you expect, adulteress?" said Aly, standing up in anger; the law is clear: you will be stoned to death. Did you think I was going to forgive you your crime?
- Did I ask for mercy?" said the guilty woman, rising to her feet, pale and resolute. I've come to give myself up. I committed the crime and I want to atone for it. Let my flesh be bruised and torn, let it become nothing more than bloody mud, a meal for dogs, and let it save my soul from hell.
- Does the fear of God alone, and the horror of your fault, drive you to this confession? Can others not denounce you?
- No one knows my crime, but God has seen it, and I await the punishment. O son-in-law of the Prophet! the absent husband returns, may he learn of the atonement before the outrage; may he find dead the one who is no longer worthy to live!
- May Allah forgive you in the other world", said Aly, "I am a slave to the law: you will suffer the punishment that your crime deserved.
- May he punish me in this world and receive me, purified, in his paradise.
Aly looked at her, trying to catch her fainting, a shiver of fear in the face of death. Her lips were tight and pale, but her eyes were fixed and radiant with enthusiasm.
- Adultery is a complex crime," he said, after a silence; "it is often incarnate, and a flower of innocence rises between the guilty parties.
The young woman stepped back, stifling a cry.
- Alas, you know everything, O you who are pleasing to God. Yes, my crime lives in me and my side has already shuddered.
- So you want to add murder to adultery?" cried Aly.
You want to deny life to a creature of Allah, burden your soul with crimes?
She lowered her head, distraught.
- Justice has no wrath," he continued, "it can wait. Go, return to the harem, keep your secret and nourish your repentance. When the being to come breathes in the daylight, it will be time to atone.
- It's all right, Master," she said, "when the child is born, I'll come back.
And, putting her veil back on, she silently fled.
Aly smiled, his pity sharpened with irony.
- Long before the child is born, repentance will be dead," he murmured.
And, taking up the dried calamari, he sat down at the corner of the sofa and continued to trace mysterious things on the Gefr.
II
A few months later, the city of Medina was full of rumours; everywhere the crowd was buzzing with irritation; people were cursing the name of Uthman, the Khalifa; they were accusing him in a confused way; it was almost a riot.
Aishah, Mohammed's widow, now known as the Prophetess, had summoned Aly, and she spoke to him with agitation and anger about the conduct of the Khalifa and the discontent of the people.
She was still beautiful, the master's favourite, majestic in her maturity, maintaining a serious bearing, a little proud of the prestige she had acquired since the death of the Prophet.
- It is a sacrilege to touch the public treasury," she said, "and to use state money for private expenses.
- Othman has already returned the sums he took several times," replied Aly; "he would have done the same, and all this noise is in vain.
- It is you who are defending him!" cried Aïchah, "you whose inheritance he has usurped, you who have more right than him to the khalifate, you whose place he is occupying!
- One day," replied Aly calmly, "when the holy Prophet had left us, Fathma, the beloved wife whom God took from me, outraged by all the injustices to which we were subjected, wanted to complain publicly. Just as she was rushing outside, the Ezan rang out from the top of the minaret; they shouted: "God is God and Mohammed is the Prophet of God! Listen, Fathma," I said to her, "your father's name resounds in the four corners of the sky. Do you want that name to live on? Do you want it to hover over mankind for centuries to come? Well, don't complain, sacrifice human greatness to the greatness of faith!... and Fathma didn't speak.
- It was a noble thing to do then. But the years have passed, and faith is invulnerable. Let Othman do a public penance and cede to you the power he usurps.
- Defy yourself, Aïchah," said Aly with a melancholy smile, "don't take sides with me too openly; remember the prophecy: one day you must become my enemy and wage war against me.
Aïchah shuddered and lowered her head.
Over the walls of the harem, through the gardens, the murmurs of the troubled city came faintly, but the Prophetess could no longer hear them; she was listening to something else, in the past, far away already a cherished voice that she would hear no more. And she murmured, repeating the words of the Prophet:
- One of you will be led astray in her faith, and one day she will wage war against Aly. We were all around him, and Ummusalima asked:
- Is it me, Master?
- It's not you. Watch out, Aishah, don't let it be you!
And as I recoiled, he added:
- Remember the village of Zikâr, you'll be barked at by the dogs there...
Aïchah raised her forehead after a long reverie.
- You're right, Aly," she said, "there'll be no dissension between us.
Go, in the name of the Prophet, you who are of his blood, appease the anger, quell the riot, and may Othman be forgiven.
And Aly went off through the town, from place to place, from group to group.
When the setting sun shone on the domes of the mosques, Medina was peaceful and silent. He then makes his way to his home, l'Agréable à Dieu, a little weary, with a heavy step.
A woman was standing by his door, leaning against the wall, clinging to it unsteadily.
- Who are you, woman?" said Aly, "and what do you want?
Then she took off her veil and let herself be seen, pale, pale as if all her blood had spilled, her eyes enlarged and ringed with blue.
- What's the matter, you wretch?" cried Aly, who rushed to support her. Have you been hurt?
- Don't you recognise me?" she said, "I've come to die. I'm the adulterous wife, the one whose heart is eaten away by remorse. You said to me: come back when the child is born. The time to atone has come: my child is born, here I am.
- You've come back! You're asking for punishment!" said Aly in surprise. I thought I'd never see you again, I'd even forgotten about you. But what have you done with the newborn? Why are you here, away from him? Do you think that bringing a child into the world is enough to have given him life? What is he without you? poor weak shrub with a soft stem! mercenary hands can break him.
You owe it your milk and your care. Don't you know the law? Until he is seven years old, a mother belongs to her child; only then can he do without her. Do your duty, and then, if your heart has not hardened, atone for your crime.
- Alas!" she said, "for so long, the weight of shame, the dread of hell! But I know how to obey," she added. In seven years, that's fine.
And she walked away, skirting the walls, holding on so as not to fall, while Aly followed her with an emotional gaze. When she had disappeared from his sight, he opened the door and crossed the threshold, murmuring with a sigh:
- Poor woman!
III
Days and years fell into eternity. The extinguished angers were rekindled, and Othman's throat was slit.
Aly has long been Emir-al-Moumenin, Commander of the Believers; and he too has seen his reign agitated by troubles and convulsions. Aishah, who had become a warrior, marched against him at the head of a party. The prophecy was fulfilled: dogs barked at the village of Zikâr, the Prophet's wife, and when she heard them and wanted to turn back, her camel was restrained by the bridle and fifty witnesses swore to her that the village had another name. For the Islamists, this was the first false testimony. What carnage there was on the day of the camel when the Prophetess was defeated by Aly! To punish her, he first wanted to pronounce a posthumous divorce between her and Mohammed; then he forgave her.
Now all seems peaceful: everyone has bowed to the power of this honest and austere master.
Aly has changed nothing in the simplicity of his life. He lives in a palace, but he considers it to be the state's palace, not his own.
Today he presides over his diwân and, despite the mortal forebodings that beset his soul, he shows the councillors a calm face and is scrupulously attentive.
The room is lit by lamps hanging from the vaults, for it is already dark, despite the early hour; the month of Rhamadan falls in winter that year.
Aly listens to the reports. He makes brief, unappealable judgements. In order to dismiss a negligent governor, he dictated this verse:
"The happy ones through you decrease, the complainers increase.
"This message in your hand: your foot in the stirrup".
Serious questions are debated; then the subject is exhausted, and the councillors let themselves go and laugh, talking about various things.
Then Aly called for a slave and had the lamps put out.
- To talk about our private affairs and our pleasures," he said, "we must not use the lights paid for by the public treasury.
The members of the diwan found that the Khalifa was exaggerating his probity; they left him, one by one, and murmured when they were outside the palace.
The moon has risen, and the inner courtyard, all blue in a light mist, appears between the slender columns, through the festooned ogival windows. Aly leans against one of the openings. The night is warm and the air is already filled with the scent of spring. In the midst of the marble, which the moon is turning to snow, outside the perfumed pool, the stream of water rushes silently down in a sonorous, sparkling rain.
The Khalifa looks on without seeing. He thinks he hears tears falling, endless tears. Why cry? What does death matter? This is the last day of his earthly existence, of that he is certain. After the life of a righteous man, rest in God!
Why this shudder, this anguish?
And he closes his eyes, trying to read the mystery more clearly, to guess how he is to die... He sees!
He sees the mosque, where he has just entered for the morning prayer, and around him, naked swords, which a gleam of light, coming through a stained-glass window, already seems to be tinged with blood; a weapon strikes him, a weapon he recognises: a beautiful sword, which he himself has presented to the one who strikes him.
- We belong to God and we're going back to him!
he murmurs.
But he flinches and opens his eyes: the courtyard, all blue and clear, dazzles him. A slave is there.
- Master, a woman demanding justice. She refuses to leave; she's been waiting all morning.
- Those who seek justice must not be kept waiting.
The woman has approached and is kneeling on the marble.
- Commander of the Faithful," she says, "here I am!
- Seven years have passed," says Aly, "and yet I recognise you, O obstinately repentant sinner! Do you still want to atone, as you did before?
- Lord! today I bring God a greater sacrifice; what was it like at the time you speak of? I offered him a defiled body, a soul in despair. Now, despite the wound of remorse, I was happy; my son, as beautiful as a lily, dried my tears with his smiles; his caresses healed the wound, his kisses erased the impurity, and I heard his cherished voice more than the cries of repentance.
- And yet you're coming back?
- I no longer exist. Being torn away from him, that is atonement! Quickly, order my torture, deliver me from this torture by the merciful oblivion of death!
- I have trembled before it, and you do not tremble, O valiant one, who with your own hands twists your heart to drive sin away!... I am already on my way to heaven, and I have seen my last evening.
Aly put his hand on the kneeling woman's head:
- Go, my daughter! he said, let your heart blossom again, love your son, live without remorse: God has forgiven you!
ZOBEID'S STUBBORNNESS
The khalif Haroun-el-Raschid is playing chess with the sultana Zobeïde.
The game is extraordinarily serious, for the two spouses, deeply absorbed, their eyes fixed, their brows furrowed, do not exchange a word. All that can be heard around them is the sound of a fountain pouring rose water into a marble basin.
The black eunuch guarding the entrance holds his breath; he does not dare change hands with his damascened spear, which is numbing his arm, and he lets his loins bruise and buckle on the mouldings of the column against which he leans.
A few steps away from the royal couple, a very young page with velvety cheeks and long silky eyelashes, dressed in a pink silk shirt, watches with saddened eyes as the sorbets he is carrying on a golden tray melt into water.
With a jolt, the pieces, encrusted with rubies and turquoise, slowly move forward on the chessboard. The stakes in the game are discretionary: the winner can demand whatever he likes, and each of the two partners wants to win.
Zobeïde, however, feels her attention waver at times; an unwelcome thought torments her and, in secret, angers her against the Khalifa; she is sullen, jealous, and does not want to appear so. It's because of a beautiful slave who was hers and whom he took away from her. What else will he demand, if he wins? Some favour for this Maridah, with whom he is truly enamoured, more than is permitted.
The queen scowled; she blushed and bit her lips: for the scene that most impatient her, the first episode of this whim of the master, was stubbornly replayed before her eyes.
It was in the harem, as it was today; the Khalifa had come to rest while listening to music, and there, among the singers, was this too charming slave. She was half-kneeling on cushions, her beautiful hair held back by a golden headband, on which, in pearls, this saying had been embroidered: The mere sight of my face overwhelms the soul.
Tell me, what would it be like to see the whole of me?
and the king looks at her too much, admires her, eats her with his eyes.
Maridah is well aware of this, she is moved, her eyelashes flutter, she rises and falls, a quicker breath stirs her breast, and her beauty seems to light up under the royal gaze. Why have such ravishing slaves around you?
Haroun-el-Raschid beckoned to the young girl, leaned towards her and plucked a kiss from her pretty pink mouth, while Zobeïde turned her head away so as not to look like a jealous woman. The king, intoxicated with pleasure, is given a calam and a strip of parchment, and he writes: I did not need to leave my place To taste the most delicious fruit.
Then he passes the verses to Maridah who, trembling and red with pride, takes the calam and finishes the quatrain: The fruit was only waiting for your thirst To give all its blood with joy.
The Khalifa is thrilled.
- I beg you, give me this slave," he says to Zobeid.
Can you refuse something from your husband? With rage in your heart, you have to smile and give him Maridah. Then, full of impatience, he got up, took the girl by the hand and led her away. The two lovers were not seen again for eight days!
She knows that a wife's first virtue is resignation, and she no longer counts the Khalifah's amorous whims: but this one irritates her more than any other. She really can't get used to it.
But now she repents having thought about it; she has had too many distractions, and suddenly the khalif, striking a piece on the chessboard, cries out:
- I've won!
It's true, the game is lost, and Zobeïde is forced to admit defeat.
- At least be generous, my lord," she sighs.
But Haroun-el-Raschid is in a teasing mood, he has a smile that promises nothing good.
- I will use my right," he said, "you are at my discretion, I will not spare you.
- But alas! I await your decision, master," she said.
He pondered for a moment, stroking his beard and glancing mischievously at his wife.
- Well," he said at last, "I'd like to see you dance, naked, right here.
The Queen jumps up in anger.
- Don't joke, my lord, tell me exactly what you want.
- Really, that's what I want, and nothing else.
- You're joking," she said with a forced smile.
- This is what I want, I tell you!" exclaimed the king, beginning to get irritated.
- That I dance, naked, in front of you?
- In the nude.
- So, master, if such a foolish desire has really passed through your mind, let me beg you to forget it.
anything you like, rather than this humiliating and ridiculous dance.
- I said.
- In the name of our beloved son, Emin-Allah, in the name of the innocent and beloved murderer of my beauty!
- Don't call on my son," said the king, "I am displeased with him; you cherish him indiscriminately, with a mother's folly.
Did you not recently put into the mouth of the poet Salam, who was reciting to you a eulogy in verse about the royal prince, a pearl that he sold for twenty thousand dinars in gold? Lord Emin has not yet written any verses other than these, scribbled on the notebook in which he was to write a lesson: I am busy with my loves!
For study, look for someone other than me!
Let's go. I'm waiting, obey!
Zobeïde bows her head, submissive; but she feels an anger rumbling in her heart that she can hardly hide. It is true that she is still beautiful, and young; under the sweet complicity of finery, very few women can surpass her: yet the mother is no longer the young girl, and the perfection of her body has received a few bruises, which it is cruel to reveal. No doubt the Khalifa, who had noticed her mood about Maridah, wanted her to understand, by forcing her to show herself like this, that she could no longer compete in beauty with the eighteen-year-old slave he had taken from her.
- Lord," she said, "will I at least have my revenge?
- You shall," said Haroun-el-Raschid.
So Zobeid sent the eunuch and the page away. She summoned her wives and ordered them to undress her. She kept her bracelets and necklaces, but had all her hair undone, and when her last garment fell at her feet, shaking her head, her beautiful hair unfurled over her, half veiling her.
Suddenly she disappears in a whirlwind, her jewels ringing like bells. Her white feet swivel over the smooth alabaster, becoming part of its transparency; she crosses her hands behind her neck, tilts backwards, sways like a palm tree tormented by the wind, comes and goes, leans to the right, then to the left, seems to beg, to flee, to surrender, and finally, closing her arms over her chest in the network of her hair, she bends her knee before the khalif.
- That's good," he said.
The ordeal is over, and without too much disadvantage for the queen. Now she dresses hastily, picks up the chessboard and hands it to the king for a new game.
But this time, by Allah, she won't lose! No distraction will enter her mind for a quarter of a second! If the stakes were a kingdom, she wouldn't attach as much value to it as she does to this hope of revenge.
The struggle was long, painful and fierce, for the Khalifa, a little worried, played as well as he could, but soon Zobeid clapped his hands together and shouted back
- I've won!
- Ah, I'm dead!" laughed the king, "what wickedness will your woman's brain come up with?
- I hope it will be worthy of yours," replied Zobeïde, "deign to come with me, my lord.
She led the Khalifa through the palace porticoes and through the gardens, stopping only at the kitchens.
- Where are you taking me?" said Haroun-el-Raschid, "would you like me to prepare some fricassee for you with my royal hands?
But the queen shook her head with a disdainful laugh.
- Come on, hurry up and explain, it's as hot in here as it gets in the furnaces of Iblis.
- Stay outside, my lord, and wait for me a moment.
Cooks and waiters threw themselves on their stomachs; Zobeïde crossed a room and entered a backyard. Many slaves were busy with the most menial tasks. Zobeïde's gaze fell on an ugly, sordid negress who was kneeling in a corner, scrubbing and whimpering in a copper basin. A mischievous smile tingles on Zobeïde's lips. She orders the woman to be brought to her, who, terrified and believing her last day to have come, starts screaming and shaking all over.
She returned to the Khalifa:
- Do you see this woman?" said the queen, pointing to the humble servant.
- She's not much to look at.
- Too bad if she's not to your liking, because this very evening she will have the honour of sharing your royal bed.
- Ugh, what a horrible invention!" exclaimed the king, laughing heartily; "you have a lot of wit, my queen, and I have surpassed you, I admit; but leave this madness now, and say what you wish.
- That's it, master, and nothing else.
- Come on, enough joking. Ask for what you want, I'll allow you to be demanding.
- I've already said.
- You want me...
- I want you to be this woman's lover this very night, or I'll take your royal word for nothing.
- Well, in my turn, I beg you to order something else.
- You were inflexible before, I am inflexible now.
- Do you want one of my palaces? The most beautiful?
Zobeid shook his head.
- My guard of maidens, with breastplates of silver and gold?
- No, I would not.
- Don't be stubborn," said the Khalifa; "what advantage will you gain from this odious night?
- That of being well avenged.
- I appoint you Grand Vizier.
- I thank you.
- Let's see, do you want to reign for a year in my place, and turn everything upside down as you please?
- The offer is tempting, but my will is unshakeable. Emir of the believers, don't stoop to begging.
- Are you determined?
- Yes, I am.
- It's good," said Haroun-el-Raschid, "let's send this negro to the bath.
And he walked away in anger, without looking at the queen again.
Many years have passed since this adventure. The brilliant Haroun-el-Raschid left this world, and his son, Emin-Allah, succeeded him on the throne of the Khalifes.
But now a cruel day has dawned for Zobeid: the young king, her beloved son, now her whole heart, has just been murdered. Poor mother, mad with grief, she tore out her hair, wept and wailed, and filled the harem with her cries.
Yet, strangely enough, she does not curse destiny, nor the murderer of her son; she does not even accuse Allah of cruelty; the only imprecation she utters, a hundred times, in a heart-rending voice, is this:
- A curse on stubbornness! A curse on stubbornness!
The man accused of having had the Khalif Emin killed, the man who is taking his place on the Abbasid throne, is Abd-
Allah-Mamoun, the son of Haroun-el-Raschid and that humble negress, whom Zobeid, with such mad obstinacy, threw into the royal bed one night!
JEMILA
The sun pours flames over the well-tilled field, and the unfortunate slaves who, harassed by the whips of the guards, work, panting, exhausted, burnt, can really believe they are in hell.
One young man in particular, so graceful he could be mistaken for a woman, seemed to be at the end of his tether, ready to die. Suddenly he staggered, his white hands dropped the heavy pickaxe, and with a sob he fell to the ground. The whip raised, an overseer rushed forward; but someone passing on the road stopped him with an imperious shout.
This someone was a woman, extremely beautiful, with a proud and dominating air, and who seemed to have the right to command. The horse she is riding is magnificent, tall, maneless, a strange colour of old gold, mottled with superb reflections, both light and dark.
- What's wrong with this captive?
- He's crying, Princess, instead of working, but the straps shaken by my arm are going to wipe his eyes.
- Dog," she said, "can't you see he's fainted? Have
him over there, in the shade of those trees.
And with the tip of her whip she pointed to the edge of a wood, towards which she headed.
The young man was now lying limply on a grassy knoll, near a stream that ran between white pebbles. The beautiful golden horse, left free, is nonchalantly nibbling on the end of a branch. The princess has set foot on the ground; leaning with one hand on a tree trunk, she bends down and gazes with deep emotion at the slave who has not regained consciousness.
The captive's eyes are closed; his large eyelashes, still soaked with tears, rest in a tangled fringe on his pale cheeks, velvety like a child's; a painful crease tightens his mouth, shaded by a light down; sweat beads on his forehead, like raindrops wetting a beautiful marble.
- Ah, he's too charming!" murmured the young woman, "I can't overcome the trouble he has caused me. I feel myself becoming, alas! the slave of this captive.
She couldn't get enough of seeing him and delayed calling him back to life. Dipping a piece of scarf in water, she moistened his temples and, as he asked for a drink, in a weak voice, she made a cup with her clasped hands, where he eagerly drank the water, all fragrant from the contact with this soft flesh.
He came to, and looked with happy surprise at the fiery eyes shining down on him; he held the alabaster cup, caressed it with his lips and wiped it with kisses.
- Are you the houri who has just taken my soul?
- A mere mortal is near you, but perhaps she will save you. I am Djemila, daughter of Togrul, chief of the Turcomans, whose victorious armies triumphed over yours. When the chain of captives marched past our tents, I noticed you, of all people, and my heart moved with compassion for you. Since then, I have sought to see you again, and I have seen you many times; even today, if I wander across the plain during the burning hours, it is because I am thinking of you and want to protect you.
He half rose to his feet and knelt down beside Djemila, who was sitting on the fresh grass.
- Ah, Princess!" he cried, "I saw you too. Through the tears of shame and despair that drowned my eyes, you appeared to me like a fleeing star in a sinister cloud, and the memory of your beauty added a wound to the pains of slavery.
- Were you thinking of me? Is it possible?
- If I had known that your gaze had rested on me for a moment, that thought would have been a balm to the tortures I was enduring.
- Time is pressing," said a deeply moved Djémila, "tell me who you are, what is your name and your rank?
- I am Nériman-Bey, son of Mahmoud-Khan, the illustrious nephew of Sultan Sangiar. As you know, Mahmoud was a source of fear for the Sultan, who suspected his nephew of aspiring to the throne. He exiled him from Persia and, to pacify the sultan, my father forbade any warlike activity in his domains. A life of pleasure and festivities reigned alone at his court, of incomparable magnificence. During the day, we hunted on snow-coloured horses, with four hundred greyhounds whose collars were made of gold and jewels; in the evening, in the illuminated palaces, feasts brought us together, and, in the midst of concerts and dances, the most beautiful of the slaves poured out every kind of intoxication. But Sultan Sangiar asked about me, called me to his court and showered me with caresses and favours. But alas!
War came, I had to join the expedition, which ended so disastrously, and, reduced to the cruelest slavery, after such a beautiful life, I hoped for nothing more than death.
- God is great!" exclaimed Djémila, "you are of equal rank to me, and I can love you without falling, you whom I would love no less if you were the humblest of men! Weep no more for your defeat. Is there a hero who has never been defeated? If you share my love, we'll run away together, we'll go to the court of the prince, your father, and you'll be my husband.
- So the greatest misfortune was the gateway to heavenly happiness? said the young man, wrapping his arms around Djémila's supple waist; let's flee, let's stay, it doesn't matter, your love has made me a marvellous armour, which will make me invulnerable to all the suffering that would not come from you.
- Is it true, Prince Neriman, that you love me?" she said, caressing the captive's silky black curls. "Would you give up for me the delightful life you had in the palace of Mahmud Khan? But I don't want to expose you to the wrath of my father: he would be inflexible and, if he suspected our love, he would have you beheaded.
- If he caught us, we'd be lost," said Nériman, who stood up and paled slightly.
- Ah! I would die with you!
- To die!" he said, clasping her to his heart passionately, "to die, when our lips have not yet been able to touch a happiness that a lifetime could not exhaust! To lose one's life is nothing, but to lose one's love, what pain!
- We will live," she said, shivering, "this very night I will free you, we will flee.
With feverish haste, she mounted her horse and led Prince Neriman back to the other captives.
- He almost died," she said to the guard, "try to remember, another time, that slaves are one of our riches, and that to kill them is to rob your master.
Togrul was passing by on horseback; he stopped to listen to his daughter:
- By Allah!" he shouted to her, "don't worry about such cattle, our enemies will always provide us with more than our stables can hold.
- That's true," said Djemila with a carefree laugh, "and at the next battle I promise to bring back a whole herd of them all by myself.
She ran off, caracoling, while her father watched her, proud to see her as strong and skilful as the bravest of his sons.
A dagger through the heart put the jailer to sleep. Djémila guided her lover under the dark vaults, through the narrow corridors, and heard the young man's heart pounding.
- Have no fear, everything is asleep," she says, caressing his ear with the tip of her lips.
The night is starry, but moonless; not dark enough for the fugitives. The horses' hooves are wrapped in shreds of carpet that muffle the sound of their footsteps; through the city, with a thousand alarms, they are led slowly by the bridle; then, in the saddle, and devouring the steppe in a frantic gallop.
After more than an hour of this mad race, they stopped to catch their breath.
- Free! Free!" cried Nériman, inhaling the fresh night air with delight. Oh my princess, how beautiful life is before us, nothing but joy, pleasure and love; we are the masters of the world!
- Not yet," said Djémila, who was leaning back with one hand on her horse's hindquarters and listening anxiously.
- What's all this about?
- We're being chased!
- You are dreaming, beloved, the deepest silence reigns in the night.
- Riders... I can hear them, they're flying across the plain, like us just now; they must be my brothers.
- Let's run!" said Nériman, throwing his horse into the air.
For a long, long time, they ran like this, he as if distraught, she calm and attentive, often looking back.
- Let's stop," she said at last, "we must fight.
- Let's run! let's run!" shouted the young man. But she went ahead of him and seized his horse by the bridle.
- Listen," she said, "there's only one opponent who's going to get us; it's Achmet, my elder brother. The mare he rides has no rivals on earth, the swallow can't keep up with her, she's faster than the wind. But our horses, born of her, except for her, defy all pursuit. My other brothers have long since fallen behind, and we are beyond their reach: Achmet alone is closing in on us, we can't escape him, it's better to wait for him.
One by one, the horses gave a joyful neigh.
- They've recognised their mother," said Djemila.
And she dashed forward to meet the rider, who was only twenty metres away.
- Stop chasing me, or come and fight me," she shouted, drawing her sword.
drawing her sabre.
- Shameless girl! Shame on our house!" cried Achmet, "atone for your crime, or hand over your unworthy lover and turn back while there's still time.
- Not so many words, but blood!" said Djémila, attacking sharply.
The broad blades clashed and crumpled, throwing sparks into the night; the horses reared and leapt, enveloped in a mist of sweat that surrounded them like a cloud. The brother and sister were of equal bravery and strength, but she was more agile and supple.
- Wretch!" suddenly shouted Achmet, who felt his mount sag beneath him.
- I didn't want to shed the blood of a brother," said Djemila, "you can't chase me any more, that's all I need.
- May the curse of the father and brothers be upon you!
But the lovers are already far away, saved, free this time. They breathe, and soon set their horses in motion.
Nériman moves closer to his companion, wrapping an arm around her waist, wanting to take a kiss. Slowly Djémila pushes him away, a shadow is on her forehead, hidden by the shadow of the night, her beautiful eyebrows lowered over her eyes.
- How is it that, when I was fighting, you stayed behind, taking no part in the struggle?
- Oh, beloved," replied the prince reproachfully, "is it the custom of the Turcomans to put two against one? You beat me to it, and I was waiting to see you weaken before taking your place. As I watched you fight, my heart palpitated with pride; you amazed me with your heroic strength, you whose beauty captivated me.
- Your confidence in my worth flatters me, so forgive me for failing you.
- I forgive you, at the price of the kiss you refused me.
- Take it," she said.
They reached a thick, monstrous forest that covered their tracks.
There, exhausted, they dismounted and lay down on the ground to rest for a while until daylight.
They were determined to stay awake, but sleep overcame their will and they fell soundly asleep.
Prince Neriman was suddenly awakened by a terrible scream.
He jumped to his feet, and as day broke, he saw a sight that petrified him.
A snake of gigantic size, its folds forming festoons from branch to branch and trailing in great waves across the ground, had seized Djémila by the legs in its gaping mouth and was slowly sucking her in.
In spite of the suffering she was experiencing, in spite of the appalling, fixed, eyelidless eyes staring back at her from close range with their metallic gaze, in this atrocious situation, the heroic young girl never lost her composure.
- Draw your sword," she said to Nériman, "and separate the head from the body.
The young man, pale, his hair bristling, did not make a move.
- You see there's nothing for you to fear," she shouted at him.
she shouted.
His teeth chattered, his legs trembled; he didn't leave his seat.
- At least throw me your sword and I'll try to defend myself!
He fell to his knees without strength.
Then Djémila turned to him with a look of disgust and contempt, and her mouth twitched painfully.
- Shame! Shame!" she cried. I loved the most cowardly of men, for him I betrayed my father and my country, I fought against my brother, I dishonoured myself! Out of my heart!
I am happy to die, for I have freed myself from you. Ah, better a thousand times to have the body of that monster for a tomb than to sleep in your arms!
And Djemila, hiding her face in her hands, surrendered to the snake, which soon swallowed her whole.
THE CARPET OF A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS
[1]
"Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Achadou an lâ ilâha'illâ llah!"
And all the strollers in the Rue du Caire [2] look up and stop, searching for the source of this strange, nasal and clear chant.
"God is the greatest! God is the greatest! I testify that there is no divinity other than God!
But that's up there, that pale man with the black beard and the green turban!
By the way, we're in Muslim country, and this is the hour when the muezzin sings the Ezân at the top of the minaret.
"Achadou enné Mouhammedan rasou-lou-llah! Hayya ala s-
salàti! Hayya ala I-faiâh! Allahou Akbar! Lâ ilâha illâ'llah!"
All the mouths are gaping, all the eyes raised, all the arms flailing, while the muezzin, slowly, circulates on the narrow balcony which encircles, like a collar, the top of the turret, and that he sings towards the east, towards the west, towards the north, towards the south.
"I bear witness that Mohammed is the messenger of God! Come to prayer! God is the greatest! There is no god but God!
Then, suddenly, like a devil in a trap door, he re-entered the minaret. The strollers, slightly bewildered, sway back and forth, sharing their impressions with each other.
It would be curious to enter the mosque (even if we have to leave our shoes at the door), to see, in the light softened by the stained-glass windows, the faithful, prostrate on small carpets, reciting their prayers, their faces turned towards Mecca (from the rue du Caire, to be well oriented, you have to look towards the École Militaire, in the direction of the Jardin des Plantes).
The door of the mosque is very curious; it is said to be authentic and dates from the 15th century. But it resists being pushed: it is closed, wickedly closed, to giaours. After all, perhaps it's simply because the interior hasn't been finished.
From this square, the view is charming; the street slopes down, irregular and angular, with its white or bluish plastered houses, its facades all plain, minus the rare mouldings on the door arches, and whose windows are masked by the projection of these openwork wooden moucharabys, which look so much like our old Breton beds, which are sought after today to make chests and sideboards. These closed balconies are the Muslim women's boudoirs; from there they can see everything and are only dimly glimpsed, like graceful shadows, enough to make one dream, but too little to be recognised. The ground
The ground floor of the houses is hollowed out into vaulted alcoves, which are shops, and to see them adorned with their brilliant displays, in the middle of which an impassive Arab sits with his legs crossed, you feel as if you have been transported to the Orient by the magic carpet of the Thousand and One Nights:
Once upon a time, in Damascus, there was a silk and brocade merchant who, through his industry and hard work, had amassed great wealth; his name was Abu-Aibou, and his son was nicknamed "the slave of love"...
Here he is, this merchant, amid the soft scarves, the silks lamé with gold and silver, the embroidered velvets, the rich costumes adorned with crescents and palms. If we had time to listen to him, he would tell us some wonderful stories. Next to him, babouche makers cut and sew leather, the colour of lemons or blood; further on, a potter turns and shapes porous gargoulettes, which will cool the water; a confectioner shakes almonds in a large copper basin full of sugar, which become sugared almonds. - Goldsmiths, perfumers and weavers come and go in the half-light of their shops. A veiled woman sells blond tobacco, giving the buyer a shy and frightened look.
But what is this wild chorus, mingled with shouts and laughter? It comes in puffs from a high arched door that leads to the stable of the famous white donkeys. - Could it be that these charming quadrupeds have organised a concert? - No, it's not them, but the donkeymen, rather indomitable little characters, who are direct descendants, so they say, of the ancient Egyptians. Dressed in blue shirts, topped with a skullcap that has seen every colour and therefore no longer has any, they squat on their heels, forming a circle and sing in unison, or more or less. The melody is rather unremarkable, but the song is interesting and should gently flatter long-eared listeners:
"It is written! It is written! the donkey of Balaam, the donkey that carried Myriem and Issa when they fled to our land of Egypt, the one Issa rode when he entered El Oudous (Jerusalem) in triumph, Yafour the donkey that carried Myriem and Issa when they fled to our land of Egypt.
(Jerusalem), Yafur, the Prophet's happy stallion, and also the dog of the Seven Sleepers, have all been admitted to Allah's paradise.
"But listen! Listen to how the donkey of the Dedjal (the Antichrist) cries out in anger. And the golden calf, do you hear how it roars in pain before the closed door of paradise? It is because they will not enter, and that, to chase them far away, Al Boraq, the divine female-headed scoundrel, sends dust in their eyes with a roar.
At the very end of the Rue du Caire is the café where you can see Egyptian Rakkasas dancing and a dervish whirling around. The hum of the darbouka invites you in, and above the door you can read, in French, that the two stars from the banks of the Nile are called Ayoucha and Zénab.
Inside, the walls and ceiling are carpeted, pretty lanterns hang here and there, and a sofa surrounds the room. On the brilliantly decorated stage, the musicians, lined up at the back, pluck or strike their instruments with a dreamy, nonchalant air.
As soon as you are seated, a tall, young and handsome cafedjé, dressed in a long yellow tunic, puts a tiny cup in your hand, without a saucer, and fills it with a sweet, slightly cloudy but excellent coffee.
Ayoucha stands up. She is quite tall, with brown skin and a fine, regular beauty. She looks serious and stands very straight. Two long braids caress her back; her fingers tinkle with real antique rattlesnakes. Her costume is not quite what it should be: European modesty has corrected it a little. If it were correct, it would consist of a skirt pulled tightly over the thighs and an embroidered jacket, not quite reaching down to the waist and leaving everything else bare. This is the Oriental way of showing off your décolletage.
But here, Ayoucha has had to raise her skirt a little and put a silk shirt under her jacket. While this arrangement enhances modesty, the dance, which we know as the "Belly Dance", loses some of its interest, as the main character is veiled.
It has to be said that this dance, from our point of view, both in intention and in fact, is contrary to decency. I say from our point of view, because morals differ from country to country, and what is a crime here is a virtue there. It is well known that Lord Karageuz, whom we did not dare admit to the Exhibition because, at his mere appearance, before he had made a single gesture or said a single word, he would have been dragged to the violin, is, in Muslim countries, the toast of the girls and boys, who applaud and cheer him.
Ayoucha is certainly very good at her art, a first-rate dancer; she is almost an acrobat. The different parts of her body, which have to move in succession, are absolutely independent of each other, and their localised contractions leave the rest of her completely immobile. Despite the perfect execution and rhythmic harmony of the movements, we cannot find this exercise either pretty or graceful. This slender creature, whose neck, chest and belly swell and jiggle, is irresistibly reminiscent of a snake whose digestion is difficult because it has swallowed too large a prey.
When Ayoucha sits down again, Zénab comes forward, a gargoyle on her head. She comes and goes, swings her hips, turns and kneels.
But all in all, she's shy: she should lie down on the ground and get up again, without the gargoyle, filled with water, letting a drop escape.
Here comes the dervish, dressed in a full skirt of pleated white fustanelle, a blouse with narrow sleeves and a felt cap that looks like an upturned flowerpot.
The dervishes, whose name means beggars, form a very liberal religious sect, with easy principles, which is much loved by the people in general. They live in convents, where they frequently hold pious meetings, during which they spin or scream until they are completely panicked.
This one is a spinner. He stretches out his arms, rests his head on one shoulder and begins to spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster, until he reaches top speed. He does not stop until he has reached the ecstatic daze that pleases God.
For us, this crazy spinning has made us a little dizzy. To recover, we're going to take the Thousand and One Nights carpet again, or rather the Decauville railway, which will take us from Cairo to Tunis in less than five minutes. There we will see the almées, the Oued-Naïls and the black dancers.

THE DANCERS OF THE SULTAN OF DJOGYAKARTA
[1]
The Javanese Kampong is all enclosed within a palisade of straw, and two turrets, topped with thatch, rise on either side of the gate.
A little in front of the entrance, two stone bas-reliefs, ancient debris taken from one of the countless superb ruins dotting these islands of the Sunda, recall times of greatness and the primitive cult of the Javanese. One of the sculptures represents the God of wisdom: Ganesa, whom they call Bitara-Gana. He is sitting cross-legged, obese, and his head is that of an elephant. The other shows the goddess Loro-Djongrang, standing on the bull Nandi. The first of her eight arms holds a buffalo tail, the second a sword called a courg, the third and fourth mysterious symbols: the bhoulla and the choukour; in the fifth she carries the moon, in the sixth a shield, in the seventh a standard: with the last she pulls Mahikassour, the personification of vice, by the hair.
But let's not linger in front of these divinities, gnawed away by time, let's go through the door, behind which a silver clink of music calls us.
Here are some little yellow men, dressed in wide trousers, Indian tunics and little conical hats. They shake their strange xylophones in time, decorated with bunches of pink feathers, and this produces a soft, monotonous music that would be reproduced quite accurately by a badly closed tap dripping water into a sounding basin. The musicians walk in line. Here they are, passing over a light bamboo bridge. This bridge should cross a river, but it only crosses a nice boat, stranded on the sand. They go back down and continue their processional walk, still shaking the feathered wooden tubes; they pass bamboo huts where, under narrow verandas, the natives are busy with various tasks: Some weave hats from rice straw, others prepare bamboo, used there in a thousand ways; the women of Djokja weave the fabric called batik; Then there are the liquor merchants, the famous curaçao, the home of a cocoa planter, and finally the Kampong kitchen, where the kokki prepare strange concoctions in huge pans and cauldrons, the recipes for which seem to have been borrowed from the witches' grimoire. 
Finally, the musicians return to the trestles, sheltered by a tent, on which the dancers will appear; they sit down on the floor among their colleagues already seated. The gamelang
i.e. the Javanese orchestra, is complete.
This orchestra is very curious and, for us, a little strange. You have to look to Hindustan and China, especially China, for the origin of the instruments that make it up; the range of bells, the graduated sound stones, the drums, the gongs, the kind of harp they call gamelang, are all Chinese instruments. After the introduction of Islam to Java in 1405, Arab music tried to supplant the ancient music, but was unable to do so; only a few new instruments were added to the orchestra, including the rebab, a kind of two-stringed violin. The gamelang has few wind instruments: a kind of trumpet called the subing and two kinds of flute are all it has.
But watch out! the percussion instruments are starting to snore. Let's see what this ensemble will produce.
Oh, the strange, confused harmony! Rumours, murmurs, the rustle of trees in the wind, raindrops on the big, rough leaves, the cackle of birds, a distant waterfall, the dull, rhythmic echo of waves in a sea cave. Nothing but the sounds of nature, an elusive melody. When the human voice joins the concert, unexpected, nasal, without worrying about tuning, the audience gets a little excited.
Let us not, however, be hasty in judging what is so new to us; at what makes us laugh, others might weep, and what moves us deeply would make them laugh. Confucius, one of the world's greatest minds, was visiting the King of Tsi when he heard a melody that so moved him that he lost his appetite and sleep for three months. Orientals of very superior intelligence have told me that our best orchestras, playing our masterpieces for the first time, only produce, in their ears, the awful barking of dogs.
The arts, like the gods perhaps, exist only for their devotees and are understood only by them.
But the spectators' attention was drawn elsewhere, and the orchestra fell silent. The dancers arrive, their bare feet crunching the shifting gravel of the aisles; they nimbly climb the bamboo ladder and appear on the stage.
At first glance, their kinship with Brahmanical Hindustan is obvious: they look like they've escaped from some bas-relief in a Mahabalipur temple. They are probably Muslims, since they belong to the Sultan of Djogyakarta; but their secret superstitions have more distant ties, and, like many of the inhabitants of Java, they must be convinced that they are descended from the god Vichnu. They are right, they are indeed descended from him.
Very young, even younger than they look, -
the eldest of the four dancers is twelve, - with their tawny complexions, they look like pretty golden idols. Large black eyes, set far apart from each other, with a khol line running up to the temples, eyebrows accentuated with a brush in two clear arcs, a fine nose, a very pure oval, a slightly thick mouth, charmingly shaped, revealing small white teeth a little apart when smiling; but it's all about being very serious, very hieratic, and not smiling.
Two of the girls have openwork gold diadems framing their foreheads, like those worn by eight-armed goddesses; against their ears, which they leave uncovered, and against their hair, a sort of wing in chiselled gold; on the bun, a gold fish disgorging a red tassel. The hairstyle of the other two dancers, who represent men because they have swords on their loins, is crowned by a sort of screen of black feathers. The upper body is naked, exquisitely modelled despite the gracefulness of the forms; an embroidered velvet corselet hides the breasts and encloses the waist without constricting it.
A purple pair of underpants, speckled with white, stops at the knee, and over it is rolled a loincloth of branched fabric, tied with a long sulphur yellow or pink scarf, extending into a narrow train, which embarrasses their feet; at the top of the arm a gold bracelet is fastened with a butterfly; the legs and bare feet are rubbed with a powder that makes them a different yellow from the shoulders.
The dancers line up in a row and wave to the audience; the orchestra starts again with the tune from earlier, and the dance begins.
Oh, how far it must have come!
Siva, the destroyer, must have been the first to see, with his jewelled eyes, this prayer, mimed before his altar sprinkled with blood.
Hardly a dance: just twisting of arms and hands, weary stretching after a long sleep. They look like pretty mummies, invited to the ball of shadows and expressing, with a discreet and graceful melancholy, their disgust for the sarcophagus.
Their supple hands turn away, full of denials and refusals; no, they don't want to go back into the golden box of heavy perfumes, it's cramped in there, their scarves are still all crumpled up, despite the sudden blows with which they straighten them; their stern mouths express the disdain they feel for the things they have seen in the shadows, waiting for the resurrection, so long in coming; things that are certainly unpleasant. And the dancers come and go, facing each other, following each other in line, with slow gestures in which the hands always play the main role.
At times you think they are going to come alive, their long eyelids suddenly lift, letting a flash of passion pass; their lips quiver, as if smiling; but no, the fringe of the eyelashes falls back, the face resumes its impassive gravity, its mysterious sadness; they continue to undulate with hieratic poses; and it goes on, always the same, to the monotonous rhythm that gradually takes you over, in a very gentle rocking, full of reveries, crossed by confused memories, elusive reminiscences of the primitive homeland, from where our forefathers came, in the old days!... We think we understand, at last, the meaning of this mystical dance, adorably chaste; we now recognise two engaged couples. Then it's Rama with Sita, Lakshmana with Ourmila, performing the wedding rite before the king of Mithila, to the sounds of Chinese music.
Then suddenly, everything stops, it's over! You're surprised and vaguely sad. We would have stayed there indefinitely, watching these slow, harmonious passes, listening to this music, coming from so far away, always the same, and for so many centuries! We were already beginning to like it, to understand this melody, in which perhaps something of that which charmed us so long ago remains.
something of the tune that so charmed Confucius at the court of Tsi; something of the tune that was already ancient at that time, and which had as its title: Music that dispels the darkness of the mind and strengthens the heart in the love of duty.

THE SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE PRINCESS
As it is winter and cold, the panels of precious wood, carpentered with incomparable meticulousness and art, have been closed around the prince, and this makes the room in which he sits, dreamily, with his arm resting on a mother-of-pearl-covered armrest, very small.
Several beautiful robes, padded with silk down, overlap and cross their collars, in different colours, on the chest of the Daïmio, and near the shoulder, embroidered in gold on the sleeve, we see a kind of star formed by five balls surrounding a sixth. This is the well-known coat of arms of the illustrious Kanga family, whose power is equalled only by that of Shendai and Satsouma in all the islands of Japan.
Yes, this prince, meditating in the depths of his palace, is very powerful, very rich, very famous; his people admire and fear him, his vassals are ready to die for him, his slightest desires are laws for all those around him, and yet today he finds himself miserable, weak, poor, deplorably poor of imagination, because for several days he has been trying to think of what surprise he could give his daughter for the anniversary of her birth, and he can think of nothing.
It is true that this princess, who will be sixteen tomorrow, has everything it is possible to possess: she has marvellous birds, fantastic fish, extravagant dogs, chariots, oxen, horses, palaces, everything she could wish for, and even marvels that she had not thought of and that had been brought for her from faraway lands.
Shaking his head, the Daïmio admits to himself that he has spoiled this beloved daughter too much, that he should not have spoiled her like this, making her exhaust all the riches of the world as soon as she entered life.
What can he do now? His power is exhausted, he has nothing left to offer his child to astonish and charm her.
What's the point of being a prince?
For a long time, through the blurred transparency of the window, he let his bored gaze wander over the bare garden and the grey, weeping sky.
- What else could she want?
Suddenly he stood up.
- Let's go and see her," he said to himself, "I might be able to guess her whim without her suspecting anything.
He struck a gong suspended from a silk cord held in place by a bronze chimera.
Immediately the panels forming the walls slid noiselessly aside, half-open, revealing perspectives of rooms filled with the samurai on duty, the pages, the guards and the servants. The samurai, noble vassals carrying two swords, bowed deeply, while the pages and servants prostrated themselves, foreheads to the ground.
- I'm going to my daughter's house," said the Daïmio.
An escort then formed and guards ran forward to warn the princess's pages.
Fiaki, which means Sunbeam, was sitting on the white mats on the floor of her private palace, and the folds of her magnificent dresses, with their immense trains, were arranged symmetrically around her, fanning out in waves and hills; There were all sorts of fabrics, of different shades, very soft; but the most abundant fabric was satin the colour of summer skies, with fine black embroidery, depicting spider webs in which flower petals had become entangled. 
The girl's face was as white as cream, her slightly thick mouth, brightened with blush, opened to reveal two rows of rice grains; her eyebrows were shaved and replaced by two small black spots made with a brush and placed high on her forehead; following the fashion of the princesses, her long hair, untied, flowed down her back, getting lost in the folds of the dresses.
The maids of honour formed a semicircle around their mistress, and opposite her, on the other side of a lightly carved balustrade, a dancer in a long dress, the sleeves of which fluttered like wings, wearing a strange golden bonnet on top of her head, danced slowly, waving a fan. An orchestra of musicians accompanied her, playing the gotto, the biva, three types of flute, the drum and the tambourine.
When the prince entered, the symphony ceased and Fiaki quickly hid her mouth behind one of the cobwebs on her sleeve, a tender and modest greeting to her father.
He smiled with pleasure, seeing again the beauty and grace of the child he idolised. She had risen to meet him and, like a sea shaken by a sudden storm, the silk, satin and brocade behind her was rippling and rustling.
He lavished her with the most flattering nicknames: Then he asked her if she was happy, if nothing had upset her, if she wanted nothing.
- Ah, illustrious prince! adored father!" she cried, bending her supple body backwards in a beautiful movement of pain. "How can you be happy when the earth is suffering? How can one smile when heaven weeps? How cruel the gods are to have created winter! Alas! not even snow to give the illusion of spring. I feel like a poor exiled plant that cannot live and cannot die.
She added with a coquettish smile, lowering her long eyelashes with an air of modesty:
- I composed an outa on this subject; but poetry itself could not console me.
itself could not console me.
In an exquisitely mannered tone, she recited the short poem, beating out the rhythm with the tip of her fan: Autumn fleeing With the flowers it carries, Has closed the door, Forgetting me half-dead, Before the frightening winter.
- I will have this outa illustrated by the most famous painter in the kingdom, said the prince; but alas, I am not a god.
Slowly, he walked away, full of worries.
- It's certain that all she wants is spring," he said to himself.
And he stopped to listen to the bitter wind whistling outside.
It was already getting dark. The next dawn would catch him off guard.
- Spring!" he murmured as he sat back down in the place he had left earlier.
Suddenly his sadness turned to anger. He sent for his Prime Minister.
The Nai-Dai-Tsin came running, bending his back, and as he paid his compliments, he saw the master's gloomy face and did not augur well. The prince remained silent for a moment, as if hesitating to give an extravagant order; but after an irritated movement of his shoulders, he spoke in a harsh voice.
- Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday," he said. I want the trees and bushes in the park and all the countryside around the palace to be covered with flowers as in the first months of spring.
Go!
- You will be obeyed, master," said the minister as he stepped backwards.
But once out, dismayed and devastated, he let his arms dangle in the long sleeves that hid them.
- It's exile, it's death! he murmured. Yes, death, because I don't have time to flee far enough. In the midst of prosperity, lightning falling on me!
His legs gave way and he leaned against the woodwork.
- What have I done to be disgraced? It's for his daughter, he really wants to be in charge in the spring.
He remained thoughtless for a long moment, his head rolling like a ball of lead on his chest; but soon he shook that heavy head and raised it with a resolute air.
- Come, let us be worthy of our race," he said, "a Japanese does not tremble in the face of death; it will not be in vain that I have taken lessons in suicide since childhood. Let's see, first the sabre, to slit the stomach with a single blow, from left to right, then the dagger to slit the throat...
He drew his sword, but the weapon remained at the end of his arm, the point pressed to the ground.
- If it were possible, however, by some artifice, to simulate spring instead of ruin and suicide, what a fortune! Let's not despair too quickly, there will always be time to die.
He was startled to see that shadows had invaded the palace and that the lights were beginning to come on.
- The immense park and all the countryside! he said, and just one night.
As he ran, he refastened his boots, returned to his home and called a meeting of the Council.
Without allowing his colleagues to sit down, he informed them of the extraordinary order given by the Prince.
- This order must be carried out, on pain of death, before the day is out", he said, indifferent to the appalled looks on his face. Listen, and understand the idea that came to me and may save us all. Men, women, girls and boys, nobles, merchants and peasants, all within a league of each other, using silk, velvet, satin and paper, must immediately start making what they can of simulated flowers; let them cut away at their clothes, let them destroy the hangings, the screens, the mats on the floor, whatever seems good to them, they will lose nothing; Then, before dawn, let all these flowers be tied, nailed and stuck to the trees, bushes and shrubs, the best on the sides of the roads, the crudest in the background; let the painters be in charge of directing the decoration and giving the brushstrokes where they are needed. I'll see to everything, I'll try to foresee everything, our salvation is well worth the effort.
Take the army, dispose of everything; no one must eat or sleep tonight. Go! and, if you value your lives, be as quick as lightning.
Without a word, the ministers left, or rather fled.
Less than an hour later, there was not a palace, not a house in the city, not a cottage in the country where people were not feverishly busy making flowers; and whoever had looked down from the top of Kanga's palace, a little after midnight, at the park and the surrounding area, would have thought he recognised in the thousands of lanterns rolling, jumping, running along the ground, the frightening army of will-o'-the-wisps, led by the foxes.
But at that hour, the illustrious Daimio was snoring behind a screen made of ironwood inlaid with gold, and the incomparable princess, in the light, filtered by thin mother-of-pearl leaves, of a large floor lamp, half rose on her bed and leafed through a book, looking for a poem about spring to take with her into her dream.
His wives were just finishing dressing him when, the next morning, Fiaki heard the music of an orchestra and the singing of many voices bursting through his windows.
- Ah, it's true, it's my birthday today," she said with a wave of boredom, "why was I born in winter?
The window frames were opened.
- Look at this beautiful weather, mistress!
The sky had indeed, as if it had been a simple courtier, been adorned for this celebration with a very soft blue, in which a cheerful sun was rolling, a little pale gold.
Languidly, the princess advanced to the outside gallery and leaned against the balustrade. But then, what a cry of surprise and joy! Flowers, flowers everywhere! Spring had come!
She rubbed her eyes, thinking she was dreaming.
- How," she said, turning round and round, running from one end of the gallery to the other, "the almond trees! the red peach trees! the white and pink apple trees, and the bushes, and the shrubs and the tall trees! what a miracle!
From all the avenues flowed visitors, coming to pay their respects to the princess, lords on horseback, noblewomen in ox-drawn chariots or norimonos. The court left the palace and gathered on the terraces. Fiaki hurried downstairs.
The prince, laughing with pleasure, met her at the bottom of the stairs. With tears in her eyes, she threw herself into his arms, crying out:
- Father! Father! You see you are a god!
He suggested a walk in the park and the countryside to admire this magical spring.
The princess clapped her hands in delight, and her magnificent pavilion-shaped chariot, emblazoned with gold star-shaped balls and drawn by two white oxen, pulled up to the foot of the terrace; the daughters-in-waiting followed, and then the whole court and the visitors, too.
The prince, on horseback, escorted his daughter, with the prime minister beside him, grave and impassive in his triumph.
It was enchanting all the way; the warmth of the sun, the fine golden mist that veiled nature a little, made the illusion complete; we admired a spring that was richer and even more flowery than the real spring.
- And what delicious perfumes float in the air! All these flowers, it's fragrant," said the princess, who every now and then leaned her pretty head out of the carriage to get a better look.
The Daïmio, who was very surprised, was indeed breathing in some charming smells.
The reason for this was that the oxen's harness contained a number of cassolettes, and the smoke from these mingled with the smoke from the animals' breath.
Fiaki, at the height of her happiness, couldn't get enough. She asked not to return to the palace by the same route; and was that possible? The prince, a little worried, looked at the minister, who remained impassive.
- Does the princess wish to return via the hills or the orchards?
- By the orchards," replied the young girl; "it's further, but it must be much more beautiful.
They went through the orchards and, indeed, it was even more beautiful than what they had seen so far.
But then a pink plum tree caught the princess's eye.
- Ah! I want to take a branch from that tree!
I want a souvenir of this enchanted walk.
- Now the deception is going to be discovered, thought the prince, casting a distressed glance at the minister.
The minister had neither paled nor trembled.
- I have the honour of picking it for you," he said, bowing to the young girl.
He pricked up his horse, ran to the plum tree and returned with a superb branch. The princess grabbed it, sucked it in and dipped her face in it: they were plum blossom, all fresh, all wet with dew, all fragrant.
Apart from him, the master was amazed; but then the girls of honour, the noble ladies, seeing that it was permitted to pick branches, took their heads out of the carriages, held out their hands, claiming a souvenir too.
This time it was too much; the prince made an angry gesture and was about to give the order not to stop; the minister reassured him, smiling with an imperceptible shrug of the shoulders; he knew women well and had foreseen this too. He signalled to the driver of an empty cart to go and fetch what was required. The carriage soon returned full of flowers, which were shared out among the cries of joy.
The minister had not hesitated to have the greenhouses of all the palaces ransacked; men mingled with the crowd, carrying all the flowers in brown canvas bags, kept within reach so that they would be there when needed. The prince, who had not guessed, was stunned.
- You really are a prodigious man", he said, as they were returning to the palace, "you have done more than I could have hoped for; you have been an absolute magician. Perhaps you were too much, and the great joy of this day is mingled with a dull anxiety: how will we be able to surpass ourselves at next year's festival?
While the master, who had stayed behind, spoke to his minister, Fiaki got down from her chariot; at that moment, the son of the Prince of Satsouma, who had just arrived at the palace with a brilliant escort, came forward to greet her. He was a young man of elegance and beauty, and so brave that, despite his youth, he had already made a name for himself; but at this moment, he was very moved, very pale, as if trembling with fear; the young girl, on the other hand, was blushing and, to hide this blush, buried her face in the flowers she held in her hand. The minister gestured to the Daïmio, pointing out the strange confusion that left them both speechless.
- When your daughter turns seventeen," he said, "give her this charming prince as her husband, and she will love him even more than she loves spring.
The prince handed the minister a bronze jewel inlaid with gold.
- Here," he said, "is the key to my treasures; take what you like, and don't you dare be discreet.
KOMATI
It was the time when Komati, the illustrious poetess, had gone into exile from the court, abandoning her titles, her possessions and her family to wander the roads, living on alms.
One summer evening, as she sat a few steps from the pagoda of Alaziyama, her eyes fixed on the blaze of twilight, she saw, almost in spite of herself, for he was in her line of sight, a horseman standing still on the road to Kioto.
There are times, no doubt, when solitude overwhelms the solitary; his philosophy slumbers, and his abandoned spirit returns to the old ruts, reliving the life he has renounced. Komati was perhaps in one of those moments, for the appearance of the rider on the path made her forget the splendours of the sunset and caught her full attention.
A hundred times she had seen lords and princesses, her former companions, pass by without even turning her head or thinking of recognising them; why did she notice this one?
Despite the distance, she tried to make out the insignia that must have been embroidered on the sleeves of this rider whom she had undoubtedly known, and she blinked under the brightness of the sky.
On his horse, which seemed to have turned to stone, the stranger's silhouette had a singular elegance, but he stood out darkly against the clear horizon, and nothing could be seen of his toilette except the hilt of his sabres, on one of which he rested his hand. He stood across the road, looking towards Kioto, and seemed to be waiting.
Komati noticed that he had no page or squire with him, which was strange for a lord.
What was he doing there? What was he waiting for?
Suddenly, Komati recognised him at a movement he made, and she jumped to her feet with a muffled cry, as if she had been bitten by a reptile.
- Nari-Hira! it's him!" she cried.
Then she fell back onto the grassy mound, pale and frowning.
- Why this cry?" she murmured angrily, "why this start? Is my heart like a dying beast that still finds a shiver of life when you set foot on it?
And her darkened gaze, abandoning the rider, remained fixed on the ground. However, after a long moment, she smiled calmly and raised her head.
- A rendezvous, that's certain," she said.
And she looked calmly at the man she had recognised.
He had moved to another spot, hidden in a clump of wood.
A group of people were walking along the road in a rented norimono carried by two men and carefully closed. At a slight whistle from Nari-Hira, the norimono stopped and a woman, her head covered with a silk veil, got out quickly. She waved goodbye to the porters and walked towards the man waiting for her. He had already dismounted and a page, hitherto invisible, was leading the horse.
The sky was fading; it was already dark under the trees.
Komati heard the light sound of a kiss. Then the lovers set off down the path, which passed within a stone's throw of her. But she was not afraid of being recognised; who else would look at this poor woman sitting by the side of the path?
It was indeed Nari-Hira who was advancing through the flowering bushes; it was indeed the conqueror whose dangerous beauty terrified all the women of the court and did not limit his ravages to her; the man of supreme elegance, who wore only gold diamond-printed fabrics woven just for him, the incomparable horseman, the charming poet.
The woman, who was leaning with both hands on Nari-
Komati recognised her.
- Isako-Tamoura!" she murmured with an ironic smile, "poor Prince Tamoura!
She was his cruelest enemy, the most envious of his rivals, the one who had done him the most harm in the days when she could suffer.
They passed. For a moment, the scent of their toilet dominated the smell of the flowers.
Komati, unnoticed, stood there, her forehead in her hand, trying to chase away the visions that assailed her, of the splendours and betrayals of this court that she had fled for three years.
Night was coming. The moon had already risen when Komati was roused from her torpor by the sound of a horse galloping. She got up to go to sleep, in the shelter of some pagoda, and went down to the side of the road. On seeing her, a rider who was about to pass in front of her suddenly stopped his horse.
- Vagabond!" he shouted, throwing her a silver coin, "answer and tell the truth, if you don't want to die under my whip.
Did you see two lovers pass about an hour ago, and which way did they go?
The questioner was Prince Tamoura.
Komati had only one word to say to take cruel revenge for past offences, but she lowered her head, ashamed of having felt this desire for a second.
- Are you deaf?" cried Tamoura, raising her whip.
- There are a lot of people on this road," said Komati, "and lovers are not rare; yet I think I saw the ones you say just an hour ago; they were so magnificent that you had to notice them in spite of yourself.
- Ah! wherever they're hiding, I'll find them, and I'll kill them both! said Tamoura, gnashing her teeth. What route did they take?
- They continued towards Kurama," said Komati, extending his arm eastwards.
The prince dashed off in that direction, and soon disappeared round the bend in the road. The sound of his horse galloping gradually faded into the night.
Then Komati retraced her steps; she went back up the path, following the way Nari-Hira and Isako had gone earlier. The paths criss-crossed and tangled between the increasingly dense shrubs, and Komati had to bend down to make out the light footprints on the fine sand.
She walked, guided in this way, as far as the fence of a garden that seemed to have been abandoned; but then, as if frightened, she took a few steps back.
- Alas! alas!" she sighed, "how contemptible I still am! That garden was his!
She, the solitary prowler, who wanted no other company than that of the beauties of nature, had noticed this deserted enclosure, but better closed than it appeared to be. She had been determined to get inside, had walked around it a hundred times, drawn back to it by a singular attraction, until one day she had finally discovered, and enlarged for her use, a breach begun by some beast of the woods.
Inside, the garden was a marvellous mess, a wild exuberance of the rarest flowers; it was an incomparable poem, which had intoxicated her for a long time; but there was an enigma beneath the flowers, and she had tried to read it! All this disorder, all this freedom of vegetation, was artificial; no garden was better kept than this one; she had not been slow to discover this. There were gaps, providing admirable views, which seemed to be created by chance, and yet any branch that came to obstruct them fell under invisible scissors; the lianas were held back by silk threads; no dead leaf ever stained the moss of the paths.
In the centre of the garden, under a magnificent cedar, stood a large pavilion, which seemed ready to collapse from old age; but Komati also recognised that this old age was feigned; the mould was a mask, the sagging roof a deception.
The house, young and robust beneath its apparent decrepitude, must have concealed a sumptuously appointed interior.
But why all this? The pavilion remained uninhabited, and she had never been able to catch a glimpse of the gardeners tending it. Perhaps they came through an underground passage. Finally, after a thousand conjectures, populating her solitude, she had imagined some pious despair and considered the garden to be the tomb of a fervent love, interrupted by death. This melancholy appealed to her sadness, and she had often come here to dream.
When she discovered that this exquisite retreat was nothing more than a cleverly concealed shelter for the guilty loves of the most fickle lord at court, she felt bitter sorrow, shame at having loved this oasis so much, and yet another feeling that she didn't want to admit to herself.
She leaned against a tree, irritated by this suffering, and clasped her arms over her chest as if to crush her heart.
But a nightingale's passionate wail through the night took away all her fortitude. It seemed to her that it was her own voice, crying and moaning in the solitude, and a tear came to burn her dry eyelids.
Yet she quickly shook off this weakness and, resuming her journey, looked for the breach, hidden under some branches, that would allow her to enter the garden.
Under the rays of the moon, which vaporised the dew, with the fairy-tale silhouette of the high mountain of Alazi appearing like a blue cloud through the improbable blooms, the enclosure looked like a dream creation; but Komati did not think to admire it; she moved quickly towards the pavilion, which the shadow of the cedar covered with a thousand black streaks.
Without hesitation, she entered the gallery, which was a few steps high, and put her hand on the sliding panel that closed the entrance. It didn't resist the push, and slid noiselessly into the groove; through the gap, a flood of blue light invaded the room.
The two lovers were asleep in each other's arms, and the green silk gauze mosquito net around them kept them in a fog. Komati, motionless, gazed at them with involuntary avidity: he, pale and as if saddened by sleep, she, smiling beneath the long flow of her hair. But the bright light that filled the room suddenly awoke her, and she jumped to her feet with a cry that roused her companion.
- A ghost!" she moaned, clutching her lover's shoulder.
- Komati!" cried the prince.
The soft moon, caressing with its glow the already withered features of the great poetess, restored to her all that beauty, so perfect that it was still to be cited many centuries later as incomparable and unique; that divine charm which - strange suicide!
- she voluntarily destroyed.
Nari-Hira, raised on one hand, gazed at her in a stupor mingled with ecstasy, while his frightened companion hid her face.
- Go away! Go away! Wicked spectre," she cried, "what do you want from us? what are you doing here?
- You're in a hurry to know that I'm in the land of shadows," said Komati, "but rest assured, Isako-Tamoura, I'm not a ghost; although dead to everyone, I'm among the living, and there's nothing supernatural about me.
- So why are you here?" said Isako, seized with anger; "you, cruel and cold statue, what right have you to come and surprise us?
What treachery are you plotting to lose us? Have you come to mock my weakness, you proud woman who has never loved? Can you understand the intoxication to which love throws us?
Are you the one who would risk your life and your honour for one day's enchantment? Ah, go away! Begone! Deliver us from your sight!
But Nari-Hira murmured as if in a dream:
- O heavenly vision! stay still! and if you are but a mirage of sleep, may you never awake!
- Ah! have you come to rob me of this hour of happiness, which will have no tomorrow?" exclaimed Isako, beside herself. If you only knew what relief your departure has brought to the court! Who could exist anywhere near Komati? The Empress herself felt her power wavering, for with your goddess-like coldness you took pleasure in disturbing the heart of the Mikado; and all the lords sighed only for the insensitive beauty. But don't think you're missed: your harshness wearied love, and no one has forgotten the death of the unfortunate Cho-Jo. Doesn't remorse haunt your sleep because of him? You wanted to test his constancy, and he had to come, a hundred nights in a row, through snow and storm before your mountain palace. Do you remember the morning before last, when they found him, as pale and cold as the snow he slept in? And who could have touched your heart, since the conqueror of souls, Nari-Hira, for whom I would die laughing, wept in vain at your feet, he who had never wept?
- Ah, those tears haven't dried up yet," said the prince, sighing. Komati, Komati, why did you leave us?
Komati replied in a slow, low voice:
- Do you want to know, Nari-Hira? Well, before I disappear forever, I'll tell you the secret of my soul, and it will be the last time my voice speaks of the past.
I was neither cruel nor cold, as some have believed, but proud and hungry for perfection. I despised this beauty, which earned me so much vain praise, to think only of elevating my spirit. Alas! better, perhaps, to remain at the common level! From higher up, all I saw around me was pettiness and misery. How could I choose a master from among those less great than myself?
I only wanted to give my love once, and no one was worthy of it; I refused it to all those who thought they loved me.
But you came to court, Nari-Hira, you delicious poet, whose verses sang on my lips, and you appeared to me, beautiful as poetry. Then I realised that you don't give your soul away, but that it is taken from you, as the dew is drunk by the sun.
Yet I had the strength to be impenetrable, and when one day you wept at my feet, knowing that you were the most fickle of men, I had already triumphed over my weakness, I could avoid being a fleeting flower in the bouquet of your loves.
I then vowed to see only with my mind, to love a soul that was all mine; and I noticed Cho-Jo, who had been secretly adoring me for a long time. I soon realised that I was his whole world: if he had loved me ugly and old, he would have loved me forever. However, before giving in, I still wanted to test his constancy, for, alas, his earthly form often hid his exquisite soul from me, and if my reason was charmed, my heart remained cold. Ah! the faithful friend is no more! He has proved that he loves, even unto death, and, in irremediable despair, I flee forever from this frivolous court; I atone, at length, for the unknown crime of my wretched heart, the shame of which I can well confess today! Know this, Nari-Hira: instead of the cedar chest containing a treasure, I preferred the charming gold box, which was full of nothing but perfume.
- Komati! Komati!" cried the prince, "you loved me! you still love me! Ah! come back! come back! and I shall love only you!
- I shall die a lonely virgin," said Komati, raising her head, "and I shall remain faithful to the lover who will be waiting for me when I die. He often comes to visit me in my dreams, to console me and encourage me. He has your adorable soul, O Cho-Jo! and your too seductive form, O poet! he is the only one I can love.
- Ah, leave this sinister madness," said Nari-Hira, "resume your rank and splendour; let me conquer you by a long test. Know that if I was a wanderer it was because I was looking for you; your love alone was the goal of my journey; it was the magnificent palace after the inns on the road.
- This is hardly gracious for the woman you are losing today," said Komati with a mocking laugh, "can't you see her sobbing in the cushions? Listen, Isako-Tamoura, I came to tell you this: Your husband is on your trail and has sworn to kill you; make haste to flee, you'll be able to persuade him, by some clever lie, that you haven't left Kioto. And now, farewell! my heart has beaten for the last time; for the last time I have spoken to the living!
And, as a vision evaporates, she disappeared from their eyes.
THE MOURNING FAN
One evening, the philosopher Chuan-tse returned home, very worried, and holding a white fan in his hand.
This Tchouan-Tse had been one of the favourite disciples of the great Lao-Tse, who was called the Old Child because he had been born with white hair. The master had revealed to his pupil the mysterious meaning of the five thousand words of the Tao-Te-King and had hidden nothing from him about the mysteries of the correct doctrine.
Tchouan-Tse was already illustrious: he was a model of virtue and knowledge, and his soul had been able to detach itself from everything, as befits the soul of a philosopher.
One fine day, however, love came to prove to him that he was not as invulnerable as he thought. A young princess, seen by chance just as the wind was playing with his sail, had upset all his wisdom and disorientated his philosophy. After a few fights, he gave in willingly and asked her to marry him.
She was a descendant of the kings of Tsi, and despite having lost their kingdom centuries ago, this family was proud of its nobility and choosy about its alliances. But an illustrious sage can claim anything: the princess of Tsi, whose name was Tien, which means Celestial, had accepted the philosopher and become his wife.
Chuan-Tse had retired with her, far from courts and cities, to the foot of a beautiful mountain, in a solitary region of the kingdom of Song, where he had been born, and there he tried to make wisdom and marriage live together in harmony.
So one evening he returned, worried, for the first time since his wedding, bringing back a white fan that he had not taken with him.
On his work table, made of red lacquer with gold flowers, the ink was diluted on the grinding stone, the silky paper was half unrolled, and the brushes were showing their sharp points out of the jade cone with its carvings.
He sat down with a sigh, then, taking a brush, dipped it in the ink and, as if in spite of himself, drew these four lines: Alas! the forehead hides the thought!
The most charming body can enclose a hypocritical heart.
Alive, you think you are loved.
Barely dead: forgotten! Your wife dreams of another Love.
Just as he finished writing, a small hand as white as milk, armed with long claws protected by golden sheaths, stepped forward and grabbed the quatrain.
Chuan-tse turned round: the princess of Tsi was behind him.
She was wearing a beautiful light green tunic embroidered with roses and birds. Her pretty head was shaking a whole bush of elegant pins with pendants, and the air around her was deliciously perfumed.
- My dear husband," she said, "why did you sigh?
Why do you write such verses? What is the meaning of that mourning fan in your hand?
- These are many questions, my Celeste.
- Answer them.
- Well, you should know that I sighed because that fan inspired the verses you read without my permission.
- What fine philosopher's answers!" she said sulkily.
- Don't get angry! It's about an adventure that happened to me.
- Tell me about it.
With a movement as lively and graceful as that of a cat, she sat on her husband's lap and clung to his neck with one arm.
- I'm listening," she said.
- Today I was daydreaming near the grave enclosure and, very absorbed, I was going, as always, without knowing where. Suddenly I found myself in the middle of the tombs. My thoughts then changed course, I thought that in this place all men were equal: the stupidest as well as the wisest, and that no one returned from there. As I wandered slowly along, a slight noise caught my attention. When I looked up, I saw a young woman wearing the long, seamless white dress worn by widows. She was sitting by a newly-built tomb, fanning the still damp earth and lime with great eagerness. I watched her for some time with surprise: she grew weary, changing hands with the fan, but never interrupting her singular occupation. Intrigued to the last, I approached her and spoke to her.
- Dare I ask you," I said, "who is in this tomb and why are you taking such pains to uncover it?
Do you think that the dead are too hot under the ground?
- It's not that," she said, with much confusion, "you see a widow beside the tomb of her husband. Death has recently taken him from me. During his life he was very dear to me; he loved me so dearly that when he died he died twice at the thought of leaving me. Ah, my dear wife," he used to say to me, "if you were thinking of marrying again, I beg you at least to wait until the wet, beaten earth that will form my grave has dried up completely before you take another husband.
Now I see that this heaped-up earth will not dry easily, and that is why I am so busy fanning it, so as to dispel the moisture more quickly.
At this naive admission, I found it hard not to burst out laughing.
But I restrained myself and offered to help the widow, who was in such a hurry for a new wedding. She accepted eagerly and, with a graceful bow, handed me the fan.
I soon overcame the dampness; the earth became grey and dry, and the young widow was free to fly to other loves. She thanked me gratefully and even offered me a jewel from her hair, but I only accepted the fan, which I will keep as a souvenir of this adventure. I laughed at first, but soon realised how cruel the scene I had just witnessed was for a husband and should give him something to think about.
- But this woman is the disgrace of her sex!" cried Céleste, red with anger; "how dare you have the idea of making comparisons of her with others? It was really a fine job for a wise man to help unearth this grave, and you have less reason than a child to want to keep a souvenir of this madness.
Having said that, she picked up the fan and smashed it to bits.
- You're wrong, you could have used it to dry my tomb," said Chuan-Tse melancholically.
But he regretted his words: the princess went from being flushed to pale, clapped her little hands with their long golden claws, and fell as if dead to the carpet.
Tchouan-Tse took her in his arms, called her the sweetest names, and when she didn't answer, he burnt some antelope horn; then he poured some transparent oil into a cup, threw in a pinch of powdered musk and tried to get his inanimate wife to drink the mixture. She came round at last, but it was only to shed a torrent of tears and overwhelm her husband with an avalanche of reproaches and protestations of unshakeable fidelity, to the point of death.
- Come on, that's fine," said the philosopher to end the debate; "I was wrong, you're the model of wives, let's not talk about it any more.
Indeed, we said no more about it. Céleste resumed her gaiety and Tchouan-Tse his studies. But although Chuan-Tse seemed happy, and put on a smiling face, he was suffering in secret: the worm was in the fruit, and suspicion was gnawing at his happiness. He would have liked to be dead and alive at the same time, to know what his wife's love was worth. A hundred times a day he wondered: would she mourn me?
Would she wait until the end of her mourning before taking another husband?
This constant preoccupation troubled his health and soon seriously impaired it. One day, on his way back from a long walk, he felt very ill and took to his bed.
The illness rapidly worsened, and the doctors soon declared that the philosopher was lost. Céleste never left his side, shedding copious tears.
- So we're going to have to leave!" said Tchouan-Tse, "swear to me, at least, that you'll leave me alone.
swear to me, at least, to ease the pain of leaving, that you will not give your heart to another man until my burial mound is dry.
- I swear that, if I survive you, I'll never marry again! cried Céleste through her sobs.
And as the supreme moment approached, the sick man was taken from his bed and taken to the south-west of the house, to the sacred chamber, so that he could die there according to the rites.
They laid him on the floor, taking care to keep weapons and musical instruments away from him, and sprinkled him on all sides.
Soon the doctor announced that the vital spirit of the illustrious philosopher had left his body.
Then Céleste seemed to go into convulsions; she twisted her arms, her fingers clenched, and she bent her supple waist backwards as if it would break; then she ran out of the room, uttering pitiful moans. She climbed to the first floor, then the second, and, without stopping, reached the attic; there she was met and told that it was not she who had to perform this ceremony.
- No voice but mine shall recall the vital spirit of my husband", she said, pushing aside the servants who tried to restrain her.
And, stepping over the window, she took a few steps into the gutter, then, using her knees, hands and fingernails, she began to climb the slope of the roof, at the risk of slipping along the varnished tiles and breaking her head on the flagstones in the courtyard. Nervous strength sustained her; she reached the ridge and, clinging to the carved wooden chimera that adorned one of the corners of the ridge, she was able to stand. This was indeed the highest and most dangerous spot in the house, the one that must be reached, as prescribed, to call back the departed soul. Céleste turned towards the north.
- Tchouan-Tse! come back! come back, come back! she cried.
And, with each call, she raised her voice. The last time, she must have been heard from several lilies away. But the philosopher's vital spirit had undoubtedly already travelled further than that.
The princess sat down on the roof and let herself slide down to the gutter, then returned to the attic. Then, screaming terribly, she tumbled down the stairs and into the courtyard. Then
- although this ceremony was generally abandoned - she started jumping up and down, to show that her mind was distracted by grief. She then returned to the deceased husband, who had been placed back on his bed, and, sobbing, performed the funeral dressing herself.
When it was time to place him in the beautiful carved sarcophagus, which she had known for a long time, she fainted, as she should have.
Céleste had no relatives near her; in the solitude where the philosopher had retired, she had few friends and no neighbours. She was alone with her grief, very lonely and very weak.
In the evening, when the funeral letters had been sent, she took the mourning dress, made of unbleached hemp, without seams or hems. She had a bed made of dry grass in the vestibule, with a brick for a pillow, and was preparing to lie in it without supper when a noise was heard outside the house: horses prancing and knocks on the outside door.
The young widow was very frightened and sent a servant to find out what it was.
The servant soon returned, followed by a handsome young man who entered so suddenly behind him that Céleste had no time to run away or hide her face behind her sleeve. She gave a little cry of modesty and backed up to the stairs, but the newcomer didn't seem to notice her confusion.
- Is it possible that my beloved master has left this world!" he exclaimed in deep despair. What is this!
He writes to me to come and see him in his retreat; as soon as I receive his invitation, I set off, and this is what awaits me on arrival! Alas! alas! am I unfortunate enough!
And, weeping, he asked to be taken to the deceased, so that he could pay his funeral respects.
Meanwhile Celeste questioned the servant who had come with this young disciple of the philosopher, and she learned from him that he was a noble student called Li-Tiu who had already passed several exams with flying colours. She also knew that he came from a distant province, that the roads were bad and unsafe, and that, in order to arrive before nightfall, he had not stopped at any inn that day and had not eaten since morning.
On hearing this, the young woman silenced her grief and hurriedly ordered supper.
When Li-Tiu came back downstairs, he found her busy watching the arrangement of the porcelain cups on the pink marble of the dining table.
- Noble maiden", he said to her, bowing, "could I not see the widow of my illustrious master, to present my sad duties to her and take my leave of her?
- Why do you call me maiden?" said Celeste; "you have before you, my lord, the unfortunate wife of Chuan-Tse.
- I thought you were his daughter, forgive me," exclaimed the student, with a start of surprise, and he added, as if to himself
I didn't know that this philosopher, who had already been touched by winter, had spring in flower as his companion.
The princess found this remark unseemly; but at the same time, though she could not help it, it pleased him, and she said very quickly, to hide her embarrassment:
- You were talking about taking leave; that's impossible.
The spirits of my husband would not rest if I did not fulfil the duties of hospitality towards one of his dearest disciples. Please sit down at this table, which has been laid for you, and don't think about leaving before tomorrow.
- It would be madness to refuse," said Li-Tiu, after a moment's hesitation, "for our horses are incapable of making another li; but I will not be so cruel as to satisfy my hunger when you are forced to fast. I will not touch the meal unless you share it with me.
- Ah, my lord, that would be quite contrary to the rites.
- Well, I want to fast with you.
The food had just been brought in and Céleste, who was dying of hunger, fainted at the smell. She couldn't stand it.
- Out of consideration for your appetite," she said, "I'll have a little rice. But since he was so intent on her, she had to touch all the dishes and, without wanting to, she ate her fill.
At night, on the bed of dry grass where she had lain without unbuckling her belt, the brick pillow bruising her neck, she didn't sleep a wink and, instead of the dead husband that she evoked, striving to weep, the image of the handsome student, with his graceful stature, his long black eyes and his mouth as red as a ripe peach, imposed itself on her mind.
When she got up in the morning, all aching, she sighed at the thought that this young stranger was going to leave again. But it was time to sob beside the dead man, to make a libation and present offerings; and the princess fulfilled these duties.
She spent more time grooming herself than she should have and, very ashamed of having left her long fingernails between the roof tiles, she put the gold cases on her fingertips, as if there had been something left to protect.
On her way back downstairs, she saw Li-Tiu's servant coming out of his master's room, his face all saddened.
- Noble widow," he said, "here is an unfortunate setback that will upset you greatly: this young lord, my master, is prone to violent fits, due to a serious illness that came on him through overwork. The sad news that surprised him when he arrived here yesterday has upset his heart, and just as he was ready to leave, he was seized by a fit of this bad fever.
- Let's call the doctor!" cried Céleste.
- It's no use, Princess," replied the servant; "I'm the only one who knows how to treat him, and I'm going to the kitchens to prepare what's needed, if you'd like to stay with the sick man while I'm away.
- Go on, I'll look after him," said the young woman.
And despite her determination to remain on the threshold, she could not resist the urge to enter the room.
The blinds, lowered in front of the windows, dimmed the light and made a greenish gloom. Li-Tiu was lying fully dressed on the bed.
When he saw Céleste he wanted to stand up and greet her, but she moved forward quickly to stop him.
- Don't do anything rash," she said. I'm sorry to hear you're ill and I wish you well. Are you suffering a lot?
- Your gentle voice is like a balm," he said very softly.
The pain is in your head, a terrible pain, a burning. Your hand, which is the colour of snow, must be as cool as snow; it seems to me that if it rested on my forehead, I would be relieved.
- It shouldn't," said Céleste, blushing.
But he had already seized her hand and was holding it in his. The young woman found this quite shocking, but at the same time she thought:
- What a good idea it was to put my gold nails back on!
- So you don't want to cure me?" he asked pleadingly.
She no longer resisted and, of her own accord, placed her hand on his long black eyebrows, which seemed to have been cut from satin, and caressed them with her eyes.
- Oh, how good you are!" exclaimed Li-Tiu, "and how good that makes me feel! Let me tell you that it's because of you that I got this nasty fever. I was seized with horror when I learned that you were Chuan-Tse's wife; I couldn't bear the idea that his sixty winters had frozen your eighteen springs and that the slug had possessed the peony.
The young widow thought that the disciple spoke very disrespectfully of his master; but she admitted to herself that, all in all, what he said was perfectly true.
Suddenly, he pushed her away and stood up, his eyebrows furrowed and his eyes strangely gleaming.
- Leave me alone," he said, "what's the use of curing me? There will be no rest for me here! I shall be eternally sorry. Why did I come here? Can it be that I, who cared so little for women and preferred study to them, that in one instant the sight of this young widow has so captured my mind and heart that I am mad with rage to think that another man has seen her before me, as if he had stolen my property?
Just then, the servant returned with the remedies, and Céleste ran off, all upset by what she had just heard.
She came across her husband's coffin being carried into a pavilion at one corner of the courtyard, and for a moment she couldn't make out what it was. The memory suddenly came back to her, she began to sob and followed the procession. Offerings of rice, meat and wine were made, and the dead man was left in the pavilion to await his funeral for a month.
In the evening, Li-Tiu seemed to have recovered from his illness, and apologised to Celeste for the trouble he had caused; then he added, without daring to look at her:
- Forget the criminal words I said to you in the delirium of the fever, I am ashamed and sorry.
- What!" cried the princess, whose eyes suddenly filled with tears, "was it all a lie?
The student looked fiercely into her eyes, as if he were drinking in the dew that the dawn of love was causing to roll down her lovely cheeks.
- The fever has wrung from me a confession that I should have kept quiet at the risk of dying," he said, "but which is, alas, only too sincere. Is it possible that it has found an echo in your heart?
- My indiscreet tears have betrayed me, to my great confusion," murmured the young woman. Ask me no more.
That night, in her room, stripped of its mourning drapes and carpets, at the bottom of her large bamboo bed, shaped like a round lantern, she had some charming dreams.
The next day, she woke up, her heart flooded with joy, and she admitted to herself that she had never been so happy in her life.
But this happiness was followed by extreme anguish when she was told that the young stranger had had another attack, much more serious than the first, and that his life was in danger.
Pale and breathless, she rushed into the room. The servant was on his knees beside the bed, weeping, while Li-
Tiu, pale, motionless, his eyes closed, seemed dead.
- Ah, my good master," moaned the servant, "I can do nothing more for you! In an hour you will have left us forever!
- If he's still alive, why are you standing there stupidly, whining, instead of trying to save him?
And she added, shaking the servant roughly:
- I don't want him to die, do you hear? I don't want him to die!
- Illustrious princess," he replied, "there is only one remedy capable of bringing him back to life, and it is impossible to obtain it.
- What remedy? Say it quickly! Sometimes we do the impossible.
- Ah, noble widow, what's the use of fighting fate?" said the servant, sighing. "To save my young master, we'd have to be able to repeatedly apply to his forehead the brains of a man who died recently.
- Is that all?" cried Céleste.
Without wasting a moment, she ran to the pyre and unhooked the axe with which they were splitting the wood; then, without hesitating, she dashed into the funeral pavilion where Chuan-Tse lay.
Without much effort, she blew off the lid of the sarcophagus, which had not yet been sealed; she tore off the silk shrouds and raised the axe to the skull of the dead man.
But then a horrified scream choked in her throat. With a frightful burst of laughter, the dead man had risen and seized her arm.
- There she is, that inconsolable widow, who thought she wouldn't outlive me! There she goes, axe in hand, to split my skull open so she can take my brains and make a plaster for her lover! And all this on the third day after my death! Ah! ah! you silly wretch, how well you fell into the trap! I'm not dead at all, and it was I who thought all that up to see what a woman is worth.
You liked him, my pretty disciple, and he played his part well... With a desperate effort, Céleste managed to free herself, and she fled, clutching her temples in her hands, convulsed with pain and shame, pain above all, for she murmured only:
- Li-Tiu! alas! alas! traitor and executioner!
Then, untying her belt, she went to hang herself on a plum tree in the garden.
Tchouan-Tse pursued her with his horrible laughter, and when he saw her swaying on the twisted tree, lamentably stretched out in her white mourning dress, he returned to the house, dragging his shrouds and brandishing the axe. He went up to the marital room and there, in a frenzy, he began beating all the pansies, dancing and singing these verses that he improvised:
"A plaster with the brains of a philosopher, that's what the model wife was going to prepare with her cute fingers!
"She was right to smash the mourning fan to bits; it was too little for her, she needed an axe to split my skull open!
"Ha! ha! All women should be hanged from plum trees; that way, men would have peace!
"And all could rejoice as I did, banging on pots!
The window was wide open, and a bird, excited by the noise, was singing at the top of its voice. Tchouan-Tse thought he heard a voice taunting him, and no matter how much he redoubled his noise, in spite of himself, above all else, he heard this voice:
"Ha! ha! (it said) you foolish philosopher! beneath your feigned gaiety your heart is wrung with despair.
"You had a lovely hummingbird in your cage, who thought that was the whole universe, and that your grey beard was the most beautiful thing there was.
"You tried to tempt its wings; you showed it the youth of spring and the sky of love.
"Ha! ha! it has flown, the bird that was your joy; weep now, foolish philosopher, weep beside the empty cage!
- Is it Celeste's soul that has come to mock me?" exclaimed Tchouan-Tse in exasperation.
And he picked up a shard and threw it into the foliage. The bird flew away with a mocking cry, perhaps taking with it the philosopher's reason, who continued to dance and sing, banging on the pots.
A FAVOURITE OF THE SON OF HEAVEN
I
The camp had been set up at the foot of the Great Wall of China, that prodigious folly six hundred leagues long, the work of an emperor renowned for the most monstrous of crimes: the burning of books.
The army camped there was a victorious one. It had returned from the confines of Persia, where it had crushed the warriors of Kashgar, Aksou and Yarkand, and subdued even the savage Kirghiz hordes.
The work of war had been accomplished, the spoils shared, the prisoners butchered, with the exception of the most illustrious, who were taken captive to serve in the triumph of the victor. No more dangers: the sweetness of peace and the vanities of glory.
General Tchao-Hoeï, commander of this army, had stopped ten leagues from Peking, near a torrent, whose noisy flow animated the site, and, in the shadow of the giant wall, which spans the mountains and bars the valleys, he had raised an altar and pitched a magnificent tent.
The general had a great honour in store for him, a favour that would make him famous forever, and before which the very memory of his fatigue, misery and wounds would fade from his memory like a light mist in the midday sun: the master of the United Empire, the one who is only named with trembling eyes, the Son of Heaven himself, would serve him a cup of tea with his divine hand.
The emperor would come all the way from Peking to do just that, in accordance with the ancient rites revived in honour of the victorious leader by the illustrious and glorious Khien-Long.
The chief's tent was set up in the centre of the camp, surrounded by a circular canvas wall. It was very simple, furnished only with a few seats, animal skins thrown on the ground and a flowering shrub in a porcelain vat.
From moment to moment, heralds arrive in squads, at the gallop of their horses, carrying a long yellow stick on which is engraved a character meaning "Warning". They announced that the imperial procession was approaching.
Tchao-Hoeï, seated in front of his tent, his hands on his knees, his heart palpitating under his gold chain mail, his forehead contracted under the rich aigrettes of his helmet, counts the minutes that pass. The whole camp is silent, its mind suspended on this awaited event. Every now and then, horsemen surge up the slopes that lead to the summit of the Great Wall - over which six of them could gallop abreast - and look into the distance. Soon, no doubt, the scouts would appear at the bend in the Tcha-Tao pass.
The general's eyes, however, are not as locked on the outside as they should be: something inside the tent seems to be drawing them in invincibly, distracting them from their feverish anticipation.
What attracts them is a teenager, slumped in a corner on a bearskin, who seems completely unaffected by the general emotion. He is surprisingly beautiful, with the eyes of a child and the flesh of a flower; but there is a wrinkle of pain in the corner of his delicate lips, too much pallor and too much sadness. His head is half-shaven, according to Tartar fashion, and a long black braid falls from the nape of his neck, shimmering in the tawny hairs of the bearskin.
The general gazes tenderly at the sad young man and sighs as the metal of the warrior's garb creaks against the old chief's chest. He is not mistaken: those beautiful eyes he is gazing into have a strange sparkle, an unnatural diamond shimmer.
- Are you crying, Ominah?
The teenager suddenly lifted the radiant fringe of his long, wet eyelashes.
- General," he said, "where is my father?
- Hush, child, keep your voice down. Your father, the unfortunate bey of Kashgar, will not be present at the Emperor's triumph. For love of you, I betrayed my duties, passed him off as dead and then helped him to escape. He will see his homeland again.
- May Allah repay you a hundredfold for all these blessings!
- If you would smile a little, I would be richly rewarded.
- Smile!" exclaimed the young man with a bitter twist of the lips; my heart is cold: terrible forebodings are oppressing me.
At that moment, cries burst forth from outside. The trumpets sound a fanfare and the gongs vibrate over the rolling drums. The imperial procession is in sight.
A cloud of dust, criss-crossed by gleams, sweeps across the plain, and soon the mules, caparisoned in yellow silk and carrying the tea of the Son of Heaven, appear. They move briskly, their light load perfuming the air around them.
Further on, an empty throne, all in gold, appears, swaying on the shoulders of numerous slaves dressed in red satin. Then a squadron of archers, looking proud and fearless, mounted on elegant, thin-headed horses. They are dressed in white jackets with wide dark stripes around the edges, and in skinskins with their corners proudly turned up, revealing black velvet boots. They slung over their shoulders a quiver bristling with arrows, and a varnished bow in a half-sheath of stamped leather.
In their blue and yellow jackets, the lancers come next, their long spears slung across their backs, the iron at the bottom, protected by a sheath.
When they have passed, men lining the path throw shovelfuls of fine sand onto the ground, and immediately the emperor's yellow palanquin, supported by sixteen bearers, moves forward, curtains closed. Two horsemen, high dignitaries of the court, walk to the right and left, and behind the palanquin, the superb cohort of princes of the blood, whose horses are bridled and saddled in purple velvet, and who carry a spear with a leopard's tail hanging from it.
Magnificent, elegantly shaped chariots, upholstered in richly embroidered yellow silk and each drawn by two beautiful blond mules, caparisoned in yellow and gold cloth, with all their gilded harness, follow. These carriages, carefully closed, hide the favourite women that the emperor has chosen to follow him on his journey.
Other carriages, green, blue or red, complete the procession, and from between their floating curtains strange cries escape: high-pitched barks, frightened meows, pretty bird chirps. The palace eunuchs occupy these carriages, guarding with great care the rare flat-nosed dogs, the blue-eyed white cats and the cages of singing larks that the princesses have refused to part with.
The cannon thundered, the gongs and brass trumpets vibrated with a terrible sound.
The emperor descends from his palanquin. He appeared, very plain, in a dark blue satin robe, and all present bowed, touching the ground with their foreheads. Tchao-Hoeï threw himself at Khien-Long's feet, but Khien-Long lifted him up and said with an affable smile:
- The empire and the emperor thank you for your good services.
And, refusing to enter the tent that had been prepared for him, he wanted to go to the general's tent, ashamed of this honour.
The illustrious warrior, the hero of this day, is not only confused by the glory that is too high; there is another feeling whose shock suddenly inflames his face: this young captive, whom he would like to hide from all eyes, is in the tent towards which they are heading, and they cannot warn him to withdraw. Let's hope the master doesn't catch on to the cunning of this disguise!
The emperor had already reached the entrance; he sank into the shadow of the cloths and sat down on a bench covered with a bearskin.
The servants hastened to bring all the utensils needed to prepare the tea, and while, in the golden kettle placed on embers, the melted snow smoked and quivered, Khien-Long, listening distractedly to the compliments of his army chief, let his gaze wander around him. As soon as they met Ominah's beautiful face, they became attentive, stopped there with charmed surprise, and could not tear themselves away.
The general stammered, got confused, didn't know what he was saying; but the emperor didn't listen to him and abruptly interrupted:
- Who is this one?
- A young eunuch in my service whom I love as if he were my own son," replied Tchao, who had gone from red to pale.
An imperceptible smile stretched the master's lips, but he said nothing. Soon he presented the general with the fragrant cup, from which the steam of the tea rose in light clouds.
The cup trembled in the warrior's hand. The boiling tea overflows onto his fingers, burning him cruelly, while he flatters himself by trying to recite the famous verses that the emperor himself wrote about his favourite drink:
"Above the burning embers, place a three-legged vase whose colour indicates long service. Let the melted snow fill it with clear water, and let it be heated to a degree sufficient to blanch fish and turn crab red.
"In the cup, made of Yué clay, on the leaves of a delicate tea, let the water be poured immediately and left to rest until the vapours, which at first rise in thick clouds, are no more than a light veil of mist.
"Then inhale this delicious liquor without haste, and you will work to remove the five causes for concern that usually beset us.
"You can savour the exquisite aroma, you can breathe in the subtle perfume, but who could possibly express the sweet tranquillity we owe to this incomparable beverage [1]?
But the general's memory fails him: he distorts the rhythm, gets lost, starts again.
The author doesn't bat an eyelid, doesn't hear a thing; his heavy gaze is still on Ominah, who is standing at the back of the tent, his eyes lowered, divinely beautiful and pale as alabaster.
II
Khien-Long has returned to his capital.
On the very day of the emperor's triumphal entry, Ominah was included among the eunuchs of the imperial palace. But he lived alone, unoccupied, surrounded by respect, while the court jewellers hurried to engrave, in gold on a jade plaque, a name that the emperor himself had chosen: Rêve-Céleste.
At first sight, as the emotion of a budding passion caressed his heart, Khien-Long recognised that Ominah was a woman. And it is in the place of honour, among the names of his wives, in the pavilion called Kiao-Taï-Kien, which is like a chapel of love, that the finely worked jade plaque will be hung.
This pavilion, with its rich architecture, is very special. Beneath its double roof, the corners of which rise up like the tips of wings, it contains nothing more than the names of women, inscribed on jade tablets and hung on the walls. Names, or rather nicknames, such as these: Shadow of the Pines, Queen of the Peonies, Source of Silver, Perfume of the Lotuses, Genie of Happiness, Cypress of Elegance...
These are like the pages of the book of love, read and reread according to the imperial whim of the lover who leafs through it every day. The chief eunuch is the attendant of this temple; he comes there towards evening, wanders through the gallery, reading the names of the beloved, and, when he sees her, he reads her name.
beloved, and when he sees one of the jade plaques turned upside down, he stops: he knows the supreme order. This is how the master's choice is expressed.
In front of the palace inhabited by the chosen one, the chief eunuch immediately hangs a red lantern. The woman is thus informed of the honour that has fallen to her. When night falls, two eunuchs come to fetch her.
She must have no other adornment, no other garment than her beauty. One of the eunuchs wraps her in a large red satin cloak, the other takes her on his back and carries her to the flat of the Son of Heaven.
III
Khien-Long was madly in love with this Muslim captive, so cruelly stolen by him from the victorious warrior, who was drying up with grief. He found her more beautiful than any of the women in his palace, and beautiful in such a different way!
At first, in the intoxication of the first days, the emperor had been happy to the point of delirium. The young girl, defeated and resigned, did not resist. She was aware of her own powerlessness and the futility of all her efforts. But he soon realised that he was holding in his arms only an inert slave, whose heart, perhaps, was clenching with hatred.
perhaps, was clenching with hatred, while he shuddered with happiness to hear her beat.
This thought saddened his love, without diminishing it in any way, and he made every effort to tame this fierce heart, to bring a flash of joy into those splendid eyes, but always dark and desolate. It was all in vain: the exile dreamt only of her lost homeland; her soul was as if absent from her body.
However, the emperor did not give up his quest to conquer this beloved captive, who saw in him nothing but an inevitable tyrant.
One day, Ominah wandered sadly through the palace gardens, thinking of other gardens, less beautiful no doubt, but where she was not a prisoner.
At the end of the shady path, she saw the Son of Heaven appear.
Fearing that she had stepped out of bounds, she wanted to withdraw; from a distance, he smiled at her, held her back with a gesture: it was her he was looking for.
He took her by the hand and led her to the western slope of the mountain enclosed by the palace.
There, amidst a bouquet of trees, in a bed of the rarest flowers, stood a ravishing, newly-built pavilion, adorned with columns of jasper and lapis, carved with sculptures, its roof adorned with golden chimeras.
With a sort of emotional haste, the emperor climbed the steps between the purple lacquer balustrades and led the young girl into the pavilion.
All around her, the furnishings and decorations reminded her of the homes of her homeland, but everything was more splendid than she had ever seen. In spite of herself, she was amazed at the rarity and price of each object. The enamelled glass mosque lamp hanging from the ceiling was a true marvel, and on the wide divan surrounding the room, thrown in profusion, were these carpets embroidered in gold and silver, the priceless antique masterpieces so sought-after that only kings owned them? She couldn't resist feeling them up, looking for the marks of Mesched's artists on their corners. Then she sank into a reverie, her thoughts wandering over the space that separated her from her homeland, and once again, grief weighed on her heart, submerging this minute of illusion.
The Emperor had lifted a window.
- Come, my beloved," he said, "look. From where we are, the view is really worth admiring.
- What's the point?" said Ominah, slumped on the sofa; "What I see there is not what I want to see.
- How would you know?
And, with gentle violence, he pulled her towards the window. This time, the beautiful Muslim woman remained silent, her eyes wide with amazement.
Is it really possible? That giant ogive, whose white marble, decorated with arabesques in gold and azure, gleams in the slanting rays of the setting sun, is the doorway to the mosque of Kashgar! In the square, there is the fountain of ablutions, in the shade of the great fig tree, and, further on, the bazaar, the houses with their black and green earthenware roofs, the courtyards, the terraces, the narrow, winding streets of the town of my birth!
- Is it a dream, a mirage?" murmured Ominah, who could not satiate her eyes with such a sight.
- It's all real," says the emperor. Thousands of workers worked night and day, on my orders, to build this picture, which I thought would please you. What I wouldn't do to see you smile, to erase from your eyes the sadness that distresses me.
Have I managed to please you today? I don't think you have. I've managed to surprise you, but I haven't been able to touch your heart, which hasn't shown the slightest hint of gratitude for me.
- Your kindness confuses me, and I am unworthy of it," says Ominah. Of course, I admire the prodigy of this work; but, like the inert portrait of an absent loved one, it can only revive the regrets of separation. These houses are empty, these streets deserted; no faithful cross the threshold of the holy house.
Never again, alas, will I hear our holy priest sing the evening hymn as he used to!
At that moment, a sonorous voice burst through the silence:
- Allahou Akbar! Allahou Akbar! Achadou an là ilâha illâ llah!
Trembling, the young girl leaned out of the window. On the terrace of the mosque, the akhum is there, arms raised to the sky, loudly calling Muslims to prayer. And outside the houses, along the streets, in the sunny square, the sons of the Prophet hurry towards the mosque, disappearing under the half-light of the holy door.
- Achadou enne, Mouhammedan rasoullah!
This time, Ominah is defeated: a sob bursts from her chest; but it is on the heart of her lover that she weeps, on the heart of the intoxicated lover, who drinks these tears with delight.
IV
Every day, at the hour of prayer, the young Muslim woman now came to this pavilion, knelt at the voice of the akhum and prayed fervently. Then, for a long time, she would let her gaze wander over the red wall with its yellow earthenware crest of the imperial city, over this city created for her, so sweet to her heart.
There was a constant hustle and bustle. Craftsmen were busy at their looms. Fabrics were being woven, leather was being cut and dyed blue or purple, carpets were being embroidered and jewellery was being carved. Groups of veiled women went to the baths. Ominah could hear them chattering and laughing. So they were happy and didn't miss a thing?
All these people were prisoners of war, and the young girl told herself that it was out of love for her that the emperor let them live like this, almost free, according to their customs, instead of forcing them to do hard, humiliating work under the whips of cruel jailers. So she had to thank Allah, and be happy about this passion inspired in her master, which had been an additional cause of pain for her, but whose beneficial effects softened the captivity of her family.
Moreover, in spite of herself, her hatred was weakening in the face of such constant and attentive love. The movement that had thrown her into the Emperor's arms had come from a surge of sincere emotion, and since then a little pride had awakened in her at being loved in this way, at reigning so sovereignly over the heart of the man before whom so many millions of men trembled.
She would sometimes smile now, vibrate the strings of the rebab and sing, without too much sadness, the tunes that had lulled her childhood. Or, lying indolently on the sofa, she puffed the smoke from the hookah with her lips and, overcome by a strange confusion, a tender languor, she didn't dare admit to herself that she was waiting, with a sort of fever, for the hour that would bring her closer to her lover, that absent even he was close to her, that she was going to love him, that perhaps she already loved him!... And the wisps of blue smoke slowly drifted in through the window, carrying away her reverie.
One evening, when she had just prostrated herself and saw the akhum appear on the terrace of the mosque, she stood up briskly.
What the priest was singing was not the usual formula, the call to prayer. His stern voice was saying other words.
Ominah listened, trembling; it was to her, no doubt, that he was addressing them.
- Ah, what a sight when, by the hands of the brave, the angels take the lives of the infidels, striking them in the face and in the loins, and crying out to them:
"Go, dogs, go and taste the torment of fire!
The young girl, frightened, threw herself back; but the irritated voice grew louder and continued:
- What does it matter if you die beating the enemies of God? The path of duty leads to paradise, and the reward will be worthy of the work.
Ominah closed the window and fell back on the sofa, weeping and fainting. What! that such kindness had to be met with treachery? Murder! That's what they wanted from her! No, no; now that her heart had been moved, now that her hatred for such a generous conqueror had died down, she didn't even want to think about such a crime.
But every day, instead of shouting the prayer, the priest hurled imprecations and increasingly vehement reproaches at her. He reminded her of the warriors whose throats had been slit, of the noble princes of her race who had been dragged to the triumph of the conqueror, of her father forever separated from her, of her country ravaged and humiliated. Then he threatened her with the flames of hell: she would be damned, since she was the favourite of an enemy of God and did not seek to escape this shame by any means. Who knows? She relished the ignominy, suffered the tyrant's love, without horror, perhaps with pleasure. She was the disgrace of her race!
Ominah was panicking under these threats and invectives.
Soon she was ready to do anything to escape. But what could she do?
But what could she do? It was no doubt to avoid any attempt at crime, rage or the vengeance of a jealous wife, that the master's beloved women were always brought to him stripped of all clothing. Where to get a weapon? And, having one, how to hide it?
The Akhoum seemed to respond to the young woman's thought: he threw a dagger at her, gesturing for her to hide it in her hair.
But that evening, without saying a word, the eunuchs untied and felt the thick hair, and pulled the dagger out.
The emperor obviously knew everything. Often, holding Ominah in his arms, leaning over her, he looked at her with a strange persistence, as if he wanted to read the depths of her troubled soul. He also seemed to contemplate her as if to take leave of her, as if to engrave forever in his memory the image of this beauty of which he could not get enough.
Sometimes, however, the young woman, who could hardly bear the intensity of his gaze, saw in it a harsh, even terrible glint: the implacable will of the all-powerful man, accustomed to taming or breaking everything. Palpitating, she lowered her heavy eyelids and, when she raised them, once again the invincible tenderness drowned her lover's eyes.
V
One night, in the emperor's bedroom, Ominah saw golden scissors, their sharp points gleaming. Her eyes widened as if fascinated by the weapon.
Khien-Long had followed that gaze, guessed the criminal thought, and the blade sunk into his flesh would certainly not have hurt him as much as the certainty, penetrating his mind, that she wanted to kill him. A sinister flash had flashed from her eyes, but was immediately extinguished by the sudden rise of a few tears, the only ones that had ever disturbed the brilliance and pride of that imperious gaze.
Overcome by invincible hatred, the master threw himself on the bed to smother in the cushions the sob that constricted his throat. He was terrified of suffering like this, of not being able, despite the horrible effort, to wrest from himself this passion that was undermining him. And how little he felt it had yet been tamed, in spite of what he had just witnessed, ready for the cowardice of forgiveness!
He had raised himself on one elbow and was looking at his beloved enemy, standing by the bed, so painfully beautiful, modestly clutching the purple satin around her sides, from which her body, pale as jade, half emerged.
No feeling had ever come close to the one she inspired in him. The two hundred women in his harem had never even given him a hint that it was possible. This one revealed unknown sensations to him, turning the impassive dominator into a man quivering with love and fever, whose will would bend before a smile, who would have been enslaved by a word of tenderness. And he had to break the woman he loved so rebelliously, drive her from his thoughts forever!
With a sort of roar, in which there was as much love as despair, he seized her in his arms, embraced her with mad violence, as if to crush his heart, sucked her in with all his breath, so as to drink in one go all the intoxication she could give.
Then the frenzy of that night, when a supreme farewell wept, sank into a heavy depression, which submerged anger and resentment. Perhaps he had been mistaken in attributing a homicidal thought to the captive's gaze.
There was no proof that she was guilty.
He would have the tip of the golden scissors dulled, the branches stopped by a ferrule that would prevent them from closing, and tomorrow they would be replaced in the same place.
If he had made a mistake, if he had unjustly suspected his beloved, he could still suffer.
If he had been mistaken, if he had unjustly suspected his beloved, he could still suffer from this love, the torture of which, he knew, was the best of his life!
VI
On the 21st night of the 4th moon, the eunuchs on duty left the emperor's flat just before the third watch. With slow steps, they carried an inert body wrapped in a red cloak, from which hung a livid head with long hair and a yellow silk cord around its neck.
At dawn the next day, in accordance with an ancient custom, the chief eunuch went to report to the imperial censors. He presented them with the register in which the time taken by the emperor away from business and devoted to his pleasures is recorded.
They read as follows:
"Jade tablet: Heavenly Dream, turned upside down.
