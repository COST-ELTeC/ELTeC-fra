Part One
I
When the bohemian Crozat was lifted out of poverty by a good marriage which made him a bourgeois in the rue de Vaugirard, he did not break with his old comrades; instead of shunning them or keeping them at a distance, he took pleasure in gathering them around him, very happy to open his house to them, whose comfort threw him far from the garret in the rue Ganneron which he had lived in for so long, and flattered him pleasantly.
Every Wednesday, from four to seven o'clock, there was a meeting at his house at the Hôtel des Médicis, and it was a sacred day for which people reserved themselves: when a new idea germinated in the mind of one of the regulars, it was caressed, matured and studied in silence, in order to be presented in its full flower to the cenacle. "I'll talk about it at Crozat's"; the lips would turn into a hopeful smile, and people would fall asleep quietly, already listening to the noise that would be made in the small, low room of the hotel where Crozat, his hands outstretched, his face open, was receiving his friends.
It was an amiable reception, as simple as a man's, cordial on the part of both husband and wife, who, having been an actress, had kept the religion of camaraderie. On a table were jugs of beer and mugs; at arm's length was an old Beauvais stoneware pot full of tobacco. The beer was good, the tobacco dry; the mugs were never empty; you could put your dirty feet on the bars of the chairs while chatting freely between men, and spit without embarrassment around you.
And there was no nonsense or trivia to be discussed, no worldly gossip, no gossip about absent friends, no clique gossip, but the great philosophical, political, social and religious questions that govern humanity.
Initially made up of friends, or at least comrades who had worked and endured poverty together, the circle of these meetings had gradually widened, so much so that one day the room in the Hôtel des Médicis had become a 'parlotte' where preachers of new ideas and religions, thinkers, reformers, apostles, politicians, aestheticians and even simply chatterboxes in search of more or less complaisant ears met; Anyone who wanted to came along, and if you didn't go in quite like a brewery, all you had to do was to be brought in by a regular to be entitled to a pipe, a beer and a word. 
But, although a certain amount of freedom governed the agenda, it was not always possible to deliver the prepared speech for which one had come; for Crozat, who, in his own words, "pursued the conciliation of modern science with religions, whatever they were", used and even abused his position as master of the house not to allow the discussions to stray from the subjects that fascinated him.
What's more, had he weakened by giving in to considerations of benevolence, politeness or even weakness, which were quite in his character, the most assiduous of his regulars, Father Brigard, would have stood firm for him.
Brigard was a kind of apostle, who had made a name for himself by putting into practice in his life the ideas he professed and preached: As a law tutor, he could easily have earned a thousand or twelve hundred francs a month, but he had arranged the number and price of his lessons so that he earned only ten francs a day, so as not to be a slave to money; -- living with a woman he loved, he had always insisted, even though he had two daughters, on remaining with her in a 'free union' and not recognising her children, because the law would have weakened the ties that bound him to them and lessened his duties; it was conscience that sanctioned these duties; and nature and conscience made him the most faithful of husbands, the best, the most affectionate and the most tender of fathers. Tall, proud, with the native elegance of his race in his person and manners, he dressed like the local commissionaire, only replacing blue velvet with brown velvet, a less frivolous colour. Having lived in Clamart for twenty years, he had never come to Paris except on foot, and the only concessions he made to the superfluous or to well-being consisted, in winter, in walking in clogs and, in summer, in carrying his jacket on his arm.
Thus organised, he needed followers, and he looked for them everywhere, in the streets, where he held by the button the people he was able to grab under the trees of the Luxembourg, and on Wednesdays at the home of his friend, his old comrade Crozat. How many had he not had! Unfortunately, most of them had turned out badly; some had become ministers; others had allowed themselves to be buried in the high places of the irremovable magistracy; some were making millions; two were in Nouméa; one was preaching in the pulpit of Notre-Dame.
One afternoon in October, the small room was full; the end of the holidays had brought back the regulars and for the first time there were more or less enough people to start a useful discussion. Crozat, standing by the door, was smiling at the newcomers and shaking hands 'back from holiday'; and Brigard, his soft felt hat on his head, was presiding, assisted by his two favourite disciples at the moment, the lawyer Nougarède and the poet Glady, who, he was sure, would not turn out badly.
To tell the truth, for those who knew how to look and see, Nougarède's pale face, thin lips, worried eyes and austerity of bearing and manners that clashed with his twenty-six years, made one think of an ambitious man rather than an apostle. Similarly, when you knew that Glady owned a beautiful house in Paris and buildings in the provinces which brought him an income of a hundred thousand francs, it was hard to imagine that he was continuing Father Brigard's work.
But seeing was not Brigard's dominant faculty, it was reasoning, and reasoning told him that ambition would soon make Nougarède a deputy, just as fortune would one day make Glady an academician, and then, although he hated assemblies as much as academies, they would have two high platforms from which the good word would fall on the crowd with greater weight. You could count on them. When Nougarède had started coming to the Wednesday meetings, he was as hollow as a drum, and, if he spoke brilliantly on any subject with unflappable faconde, it was to say nothing. In the first volume of Glady, there were only words cleverly arranged for the pleasure of the ears and eyes. Now, the lawyer's speeches were underpinned by ideas, just as the poet's verses were saying something -- and these ideas were his own; this something was the fragrance of his teaching.
For half an hour after the pipes had been burning with a forced draught, the smoke rose only heavily to the ceiling, and it was in a cloud that Brigard could be seen, like a bearded god, proclaiming his law, with his hat on his head, for, although it was his rule never to take it off, he manoeuvred it continually while he was speaking, putting it sometimes forward, sometimes back, to the right, to the left, raising it, flattening it according to the needs of his argument.
There's no denying it," he said, "that we scatter our great strength when we should be concentrating it.
He pushed down his hat.
- In fact," he raised his hat, "the time has come for us to assert ourselves as a group, and it is our duty, since it is a need for humanity...
But Crozat, who was sitting near the entrance, stopped him as he passed and shook his hand:
- Well, Saniel! Hello, doctor.
- Good evening, dear sir.
- Come closer to the table: the beer is good today.
- Thank you, I'll be very happy here.
Without taking the chair that Crozat pointed out to him, he leaned against the wall: He was a tall, solid lad of about thirty, with tawny hair falling over the collar of his frock coat, a long, curling beard, an energetic but tormented and ravaged face, with pale blue eyes that gave him a hard expression that was further emphasised by his bony jaw and decisive bearing: in all, a Gaul, a true Gaul of times gone by, strong, skull-faced and resolute. 
Brigard continued:
- It is indisputable -- that was his formula, for everything he said was indisputable for him, by the very fact that he said it -- it is indisputable that, in the disarray in which humanity is struggling, it is important to establish the dogma of conscience, with duty done and inner satisfaction as its sole sanction...
- Duty done to whom?" interrupted Saniel, breaking away from the wall to take a step forward.
- To ourselves.
- So start by establishing what our duties are, and to do that codify what is good and what is bad.
- That's easy," says a voice.
- Easy if you accept a sort of innate respect for human life, property and the family. But you will recognise that not all men have this respect. How many men do not believe that it is wrong to take their friend's wife, a crime to appropriate something they need, or to kill an enemy! Where then are the duties of those who reason and feel in this way? What is their inner satisfaction worth? That's why I don't accept that conscience is a precision instrument capable of qualifying or weighing our actions.
Brigard suppressed a few exclamations.
- What rule will mankind obey, I ask you?
- To that of force, which is the last word in the philosophy of life...
- ... Which leads to gradual and skilful extermination. Is that what you want?
- Why not? I do not shrink from an extermination that relieves mankind of the non-values that it drags along without being able to move forward and free itself, succumbing to the pain. Wouldn't it be to humanity's advantage to get rid of these non-values that obstruct its path?
- It's at least a strange idea for a doctor," Crozat interrupted, "since it does away with hospitals.
- But not at all: I'm keeping them for the study of monsters.
- By placing society on this footing of acute antagonism," said Brigard, "you are suppressing society itself, which is based on reciprocity and solidarity, and you are thus creating a state of mistrust in your strongest members that paralyses them. Carthage and Venice practised this selection by force, and they collapsed.
-- You speak of force, my dear Saniel," interrupted a voice; "where do you get that, the force of things, fatum; there is no initiative, no will; it's events that decide for us, the climate, the temperament, the environment.
- So," replied Saniel, "there is no responsibility, and this instrument, conscience, which should weigh everything up, is useless. Not to mention the fact that the consequences of events, that success or defeat, also distort it, because a certain act that you thought reprehensible when you carried it out may serve the species, while another that you thought beneficial may harm it; from which it follows that only intentions should be judged and that only God can fathom hearts.
He laughed:
- Do you want that? Is that your conclusion?
A waiter from the hotel came in carrying jugs of beer on a tray, and the discussion was inevitably interrupted, with everyone surrounding the table where Crozat was filling mugs.
Then private conversations began, with those who had been on holiday telling those who had stayed in Paris what they had done.
Saniel had come to shake hands with Brigard, who had greeted him rather coldly; then he had approached Glady with the obvious intention of trying to corner him; but the latter had announced that he was obliged to leave, and Saniel had then said that he could not stay either and that he had only come in passing.
When they had both left, Brigard, addressing Crozat and Nougarède, who were at that moment near him, said that Saniel worried him:
- He's a boy who thinks he's stronger than life," he said, "because he's strong and intelligent; let him be careful it doesn't crush him!
II
When Saniel and Glady stood on the pavement of the rue de Vaugirard, the rain that had been falling since morning, whipped up by gusts from the west, had just stopped, and the asphalt shone clean and shiny like a mirror.
- It's nice to walk on," said Saniel.
- It's going to start raining again," replied Glady, looking up at the sky, which was full of big black clouds blowing across the face of the moon.
- I don't think so.
It was obvious that Glady only wanted to take a carriage, but as none was passing by at the moment, he had to walk alongside Saniel.
- Do you know," he said, "that you have injured Brigard?
- Sincerely, I regret it; but our friend Crozat's room is not quite a church yet, and I had no idea that discussion was forbidden there.
- To deny is not to discuss.
- You say that as if you were angry with me.
- Don't believe it; I'm angry that you hurt Brigard, that and nothing more!
- That's too much, because I have a sincere regard for you and, if you'll allow me to say it, a real friendship.
But Glady did not seem to want the conversation to take this turn.
- I think there's an empty carriage here," he said, spotting a hansom coming towards them.
- No," replied Saniel, "I can see the glow of a cigar behind the window.
Glady made a gesture of impatience which he did not abandon, but which Saniel, who was watching him, must have noticed all the more because he was watching him.
Glady lived in fear of borrowers. It was enough for someone to appear to want to speak to him in private for him to immediately believe that someone was going to ask him for fifty louis or twenty francs, so that any friend or comrade was an enemy against whom he had to defend his purse. At a meeting, if he felt that someone was looking at him, he immediately became suspicious. In the street, if someone came up to him, he was immediately on his guard. People smiled at him: he was afraid, and even more afraid when someone held out their hand to him, never knowing whether it was to shake his or to put something in. And to make sure he didn't put anything in, he was on the lookout as if someone was going to jump out at him, his eyes open, his ears tense, both hands on his pockets. Hence his attitude towards Saniel, in whom he sensed a demand for money, and his attempt to escape by taking a car. The guignon didn't want him to find any, so he tried to defend himself in another way:
- Don't be surprised," he said volubly, like a man who speaks so that no one can get a word in, "that I was sorry to see Brigard take to heart an outburst which was obviously not directed against him.
- Neither against him nor his ideas.
- I admit it; you don't have to defend yourself; but I have so much friendship, so much esteem, so much respect for Brigard that everything that touches him resonates with me. And how could it be otherwise, when you know what he's worth and what a man he is? Isn't it admirable, this life of mediocrity that he has voluntarily made for himself to ensure his freedom? What better example!
- Not everyone can follow it.
- You think we can't make do with ten francs a day.
- I mean, not everyone is lucky enough to earn ten francs a day.
Glady's vague fears, which had only been based on a premonition, were clarified by this word. After walking down the rue Férou, they arrived at the Place Saint-Sulpice.
- I think I'm going to find a carriage at last," he said hastily.
But this hope was not fulfilled: there was not a single carriage at the station; as a result, his impatience grew; he was caught and forced to endure Saniel's assault without being able to escape.
This is what Saniel said:
- You are now obliged to travel with me, and frankly, I'm delighted, because I have to talk to you about something... serious... on which my future depends.
- This is no place for a serious conversation.
- I can't think of anything.
- We could make an appointment.
- What's the point, when chance gives it to us?
We had to resign ourselves and at least, in the meantime, show some good grace.
- I'm all yours," he said, in a gracious tone that contrasted with his initial resistance.
Saniel, who had been so urgent a few moments earlier, remained silent for a moment, walking beside Glady, who was looking at the shiny asphalt:
- I told you that my future depended on the matter I wished to discuss with you; here it is in a nutshell: if I don't manage to get 3000 francs within two days, I shall be obliged to leave Paris, to give up my studies and my work on the train, to go and live in my native country and become a country doctor.
Glady didn't flinch, for if he hadn't foreseen the figure, he was expecting the request: he continued to look at the tips of his toes.
- You know," continued Saniel, "that I'm the son of peasants: my father was a blacksmith, a very small blacksmith in a poor village in the Auvergne. At school I showed a certain aptitude for work that my classmates didn't have to the same degree. Our parish priest took a liking to me and wanted to teach me what he knew, which didn't take very long. So he sent me to the minor seminary. But I didn't have the docility of mind and the submissiveness of character that such an education requires, and after a few years of tug-of-war, if I wasn't sent away, I was made to understand that they would be very happy to see me leave. I then joined a small boarding house as a tutor, without any salary, of course, for board and lodging. I passed my exams well and was preparing for my bachelor's degree when, following a discussion, I left the boarding house. I had earned some money giving private lessons and had about eighty francs to my name. I left for Paris, where I arrived at five o'clock one morning in June, not knowing a soul. I had a small case with a few shirts in it, which meant I had to take a carriage. I told the coachman to take me to a hotel in the Latin Quarter. What hotel?" said the coachman. -- I don't care. -- Do you want the Hôtel Racine? -- Go for the Hotel Racine: I like the name. We had been driving long enough when the coachman stopped his horse and wanted to turn back. "What's the matter? -- I have passed the Hotel Racine. -- Go on. I don't care for the Hotel Racine any more than any other. -- Do you want the Hotel du Sénat? -- The name suits me even better; perhaps it's an omen. He took me to the Hôtel du Sénat, where, with what was left of my eighty francs, I paid a month's rent in advance. I stayed there for eight years.
- It's a funny thing.
- What could I do? I knew Latin and Greek as well as any man in France, but as for the rest I was as ignorant as a spoon. That very morning, I tried to make the most of what I knew, and went to see a publisher of classical books whom my Greek literature teacher had told me about. After questioning me, he gave me a Pindar to prepare, with notes in Latin, and advanced me thirty francs, which kept me going for a month. What had brought me to Paris was the desire to work, but I hadn't told myself in advance what I would be working on; I went wherever courses were open: to the Sorbonne, the Collège de France, the École de droit, the École de médecine, and it was only after a month that I made up my mind: the subtleties of law had displeased me; on the contrary, the teaching of medicine based on the observation of facts attracted me: I would be a doctor.
- Quite a marriage of reason, come on.
- No, a marriage of love; for reason, if I had consulted it, would have told me that to marry medicine when you have nothing, no family to support you, no connections to push you, is to condemn yourself to a life of hardship, struggle and misery, in which the best-tempered leave shred after shred of physical health as well as moral health, their strength as well as their dignity. My time at school was a happy one; I worked and, with the few Latin lessons I gave, I had enough to eat. When I was paid six hundred francs, eight hundred francs, nine hundred francs as a boarder, I thought it was a fortune, and I would have stayed a boarder all my life if I could. When I became a doctor, I had to leave the hospital. Rich with a few thousand francs, I would have strictly followed the path my ambition had dreamed of, that of the competitive examination. But I had no money to wait. While looking after the mistress of one of my comrades, I met an upholsterer who offered to furnish a flat that I would pay for later...
- Like a casserole dish.
- Precisely. I was tempted. Don't forget that I had spent eight years at the Hôtel du Sénat and that I knew nothing of Parisian life; at home! in my own furniture! with a servant in my anteroom, I was going to be somebody. My upholsterer could have set me up in his district and perhaps he would have found me some patients among the clientele of the haute noce; but he didn't have the idea, no doubt judging that with my clumsy appearance I wasn't made to succeed in that world: when you arrive, it's an originality to be a peasant, people think you're strong; on the road, it's a disgrace. It was in the rue Louis-le-Grand, in a serious-looking house, that he chose the flat he furnished for me: a masterly salon with six armchairs and two Louis XIV sofas in the grand style, a study that was both austere and comfortable, nothing in the dining room, a small iron bed and a straw chair in the bedroom. So here I was, ready to go down fighting with ten thousand francs in debt behind me, interest on that sum, very high interest, rent of two thousand four hundred francs, not a penny in my pocket, not a relation...
- It was bravery.
-- I didn't know that in Paris everything is done through relationships, and I imagined that strong arms were enough for an intelligent man to open up an opening. Experience was to teach me. When a new doctor arrives somewhere, it's not usually with sympathy that his colleagues welcome him: "What does this intruder want? Weren't there enough of us already! They keep an eye on him and, the first time he loses a patient, they take advantage of his ignorance or carelessness to make his job difficult. I was made to feel the distance that separates an honourable businessman from a starving man, and I had to understand that they would only protect me if I ordered the specialities they were exploiting, the iron of this one, the tar of that one. So when I started out, my only customers were the locals, whose policy was not to pay their doctor, waiting for the arrival of a new one before leaving the old one - and there are a lot of them everywhere. As chance would have it, my concierge was an Auvergnat like me, and he saw it as his duty to give me free treatment for all our countries, which he canvassed in the neighbourhood and everywhere else, so that I had the patriotic satisfaction of seeing all the charcoal burners from the Auvergne fit into my beautiful armchairs. In the end, by staying religiously at home on summer Sundays, while my colleagues were out in the fields; by getting up quickly at night every time my doorbell rang, I ended up hooking a few less fanciful customers. I won a prize at the Académie. At the same time I was giving anatomy lessons on the cheap in boarding houses in the suburbs; I gave lessons and undertook all the anonymous bookshop and journalistic work I could get my hands on. I slept five hours a day, and in four years I managed to reduce my debt by seven thousand francs. My upholsterer would have liked to be paid: I would have managed, but that was not his intention: what he wants is to take back his furniture, which is not worn out, and keep what he has received. If I don't pay these three thousand francs in a few days, I'll be out on the street. The truth is that I have a thousand francs to collect, but the customers who owe me are not in Paris or won't pay until January. That's my situation: desperate, because I have no-one to turn to; the people I've turned to haven't listened to me; I told you I had no contacts, and I have no friends either... perhaps because I'm not likeable. That's when I thought of you. You know how I am. You know that people think I have a future: in three months' time I'll be a hospital doctor; my competitors agree that I won't fail the agrégation; I'm working on experiments that might make me a name; would you like to offer me your hand?
Glady held out his hand.
- I thank you for coming to me, it's a proof of confidence that touches me," he shook the hand he had taken warmly, "I can see that you have guessed the feelings of esteem that you inspire in me.
Saniel drew a breath.
- Unfortunately," continued Glady, "I could only do what you want me to do by contradicting my line of conduct. When I started out in life, I obliged everyone who came to me, and when I didn't lose my friends, I lost my money. So I swore to myself that I would refuse all loans. It's an oath I can't break. What would my old friends say if they knew that I had done for a young man what I had refused them?
- Who would know?
- My conscience.
They reached the Quai Voltaire, where a number of carriages were parked.
- Here are some carriages at last," said Glady, "forgive me for leaving you, I'm in a hurry.
III
Glady had got into the carriage so quickly that Saniel stood on the pavement, dumbfounded; it was only when the door closed that he understood:
- His conscience!" he murmured; "there they are! Tartufes!
After a moment's hesitation, he continued on his way and took the Pont des Saints-Pères; but he walked with hesitant steps, like a man who doesn't know where he's going. Soon he stopped and, leaning both arms on the parapet, watched the Seine flow swiftly, darkly, with small waves that were fringed with white foam at the circumference of the eddies. The rain had stopped, but the wind was still gusting, lifting the river and swinging the red and green lights of the omnibus boats in the darkness. Passers-by came and went, and more than one looked at him out of the corner of their eye, wondering what that big body was doing there and whether he was going to jump into the water.
And why not? What better thing to do?
In fact, that's what Saniel was telling himself as he watched the water flow: take a plunge and put an end to the crushing struggle he had been waging madly for four years and which, in the end, was panicking his spirit.
It wasn't the first time he had been tempted by the idea of putting an end to it, and he had only put it aside by constantly inventing new combinations which, it seemed to him at the very moment they came to mind, could save him. Why give up before you've tried and exhausted everything? That was how he had come to Glady. He knew him, however, and knew that his reputation for avarice, which everyone joked about, was based on certain facts; but he told himself that, if the owner stubbornly refused any friendly loan, which would only serve to pay youthful debts, the poet might very well want to fulfil the role of Providence and save from shipwreck, without risking anything, a man of the future who, later on, would return the service he had received. And it was under these conditions that he had risked his request. The owner had replied; the poet had remained silent. Now he could expect nothing from anyone. This was the last one.
By explaining his situation to Glady, he had lessened rather than exaggerated his misery. It wasn't just his upholsterer that he owed, it was also his tailor, his bootmaker, his coal merchant, his concierge, everyone with whom he was in contact. In reality, his creditors had not harassed him too much up to now, because they expected to be paid, but that was no longer going to be the case when they saw him being sued: they too would set the bailiffs in motion; so how would he defend himself? How would he live? He would have no choice but to return to the Hôtel du Sénat, where they would not leave him alone, or to go back to his native country and become a country doctor. In either case, he would have to give up all his ambitions. Wasn't death better?
What good was life if it gave him nothing of what he had dreamed and wanted?
Like many people who come into regular contact with death, life itself meant little to him, his own as well as that of others. Like Hamlet, he would say: "To die... to sleep, nothing more", but without adding: "To die... to sleep, to dream perhaps", as he was quite sure that the dead did not dream; and what could be better than to sleep for those whose road has been hard?
He remained thus absorbed in his thoughts, when a body, coming between him and the flickering gas burner, cast a shadow over his head which mechanically made him sit up straight. Who was there? Just a town sergeant who had come to lean against the parapet on which he himself was leaning, he realised: his attitude was certainly that of a man about to throw himself into the river and the town sergeant was standing there to prevent him from doing so.
- Thank you!" he said to the astonished sergeant.
And he set off again, walking quickly, but clearly hearing the policeman who was following in his footsteps, taking him for a madman who needed to be watched.
When he left the Pont des Saints-Pères for the Place du Carrousel, this surveillance ceased and he was able to return to his thoughts freely, at least as freely as his confusion and despondency allowed:
- It is the weak who kill themselves; the strong fight to their last breath.
And however low he had sunk, he had not yet drawn his last breath.
When he had decided to go to Glady, he had hesitated between the latter and a loan shark called Caffié whom he did not know personally, but of whom he had often heard as a real rascal who dealt in all sorts of affairs, bad rather than good, successions, marriages, prohibitions, blackmail ; And if it hadn't been his, it was as much for fear of being refused as for fear of putting himself in such hands, should they wish to accept him. But these scruples and fears were no longer in season: since he missed Glady, whatever the cost and whatever the outcome, he had to turn to the rascal.
He knew that Caffié lived in the rue Sainte-Anne, but he didn't know his number: all he had to do was go to one of his customers, a wine merchant in the rue Thérèse, to find him by consulting the Bottin. It was only a stone's throw away, and he immediately decided to risk the adventure; the business was urgent. Discouraged by all the approaches he had tried up to that point, put off by betrayed hopes, irritated by the rebuffs he had received, he did not delude himself about the chances of this last attempt, but in the end he had to make it, no matter how flimsy those chances were.
Caffié lived in an old house on the Butte des Moulins, which must once have been a private mansion: it consisted of two buildings, one on the street, the other on an inner courtyard. A carriage entrance gave access to this courtyard, and under its vault, after a staircase, was the caretaker's lodge. He had to wait a few moments and, in his nervous impatience, began to walk up and down the courtyard. Finally, a broken, stooped old woman appeared, a rat-de-cave in her hand, and excused herself: alone, she couldn't be everywhere at once, guarding her dressing room and lighting the landlady's staircase. Caffié lived on the first floor of the building on the street.
Saniel went up to the first floor and rang the bell; a fairly long time passed, or at least it seemed very long to his concern, before he was answered; finally, he heard a slow, shuffling step on the pavement, and the door opened, but held open by his hand and foot:
- Who are you asking for?
- M. Caffié.
- I'm here. And who are you?
- Doctor Saniel.
- I haven't called a doctor.
- I'm not here as a doctor, but as a customer.
- This is not the time to consult me.
- Since you're at home.
- By the way!
And Caffié, deciding to open the door, gave way to Saniel, then closed it again.
- Come into my study.
They were in a very small room cluttered with files, furnished only with an old desk and three chairs; it communicated directly with the businessman's study, which was larger but furnished with the same simplicity and cluttered with paperwork that smelt of mould.
- My clerk is ill at the moment," said Caffié, "and when I'm alone I don't like to open the door.
With this excuse, he showed Saniel to a chair and, sitting himself down in front of his desk, lit by a lamp whose shade he had removed, he said:
- Doctor, I'm listening.
He put the shade back on the lamp.
He owed three thousand francs to the upholsterer who had supplied his furniture and, as he was unable to pay at the moment, he was facing imminent legal proceedings.
- Who is this upholsterer?" asked Caffié, holding his left cheek in his right hand.
- Jardine, boulevard Haussmann.
- Well-known. It's his business to take back furniture he's sold when it's three quarters paid for, and it's made him rich. How much have you already paid him for this ten thousand francs' worth of furniture?
- With deposits and interest, nearly twelve thousand.
- And you're back to three thousand?
- Yes, I will.
- That's very kind.
Caffié seemed full of admiration for this way of proceeding.
- What guarantees do you have to offer for this loan of three thousand francs?
- None other than my present position, I admit, and above all my future.
At a sign from Caffié, he explained what that future was, while the businessman, his cheek in his hand, listened with an occasional muffled sigh, a sort of complaint.
- Hum! hum!" said Caffié when Saniel had reached the end of his explanation; "you know, my dear sir, you know :
Ma foi, sur l'avenir bien fou qui se fiera :
Those who laugh on Friday will cry on Sunday.
You have reached Sunday, my dear sir.
- But I am neither at the end of my life, nor at the end of my energy, and I assure you that this energy makes me capable of many things.
- I don't doubt it; I know what energy can do: tell a starving Greek to go to heaven, and he will:
Greculus esuriens in caelum, jusseris, ibit.
But I don't see that you've gone to heaven.
Caffié smiled evilly and grimaced: before becoming the usurer in the rue Sainte-Anne whom everyone spoke of as a rascal, he had been a solicitor in the provinces, a deputy judge, and although undeserved misfortune had forced him to resign and come to Paris to hide his unpleasantness, he never lost the opportunity to show that he was, by virtue of his education, above his present position: Finding in this new client a scholar, he was quite happy to place a few quotations which should earn him some consideration. 
- Perhaps it's because I'm not Greek," replied Saniel; "but I'm from Auvergne, and people from my country have strong backs.
Caffié shook his head:
- My dear sir, I have to tell you frankly that I don't think it's possible: I would do it myself, because the intelligence I can see in your face and the resolution that is evident throughout your person inspire my confidence; but I have no funds to put into these kinds of operations; as always, I can only act as an intermediary, in other words, I can only offer this loan to one of my clients, and I don't see who will be satisfied with guarantees based only on a more or less problematic future; there are so many doctors in Paris who are in your position! 
Saniel rose to his feet.
- You're leaving!" cried Caffié.
- But...
- Do sit down, my dear sir. You mustn't throw the handle after the axe. You make me a proposal, I'll show you the difficulties that I think it will encounter, but I'm not saying that there isn't a way to get you out of your predicament; it's up to you to look for it. I've only known you for a few minutes, but it doesn't take long to appreciate people like you, and frankly I'm very interested in you.
What was his point? Saniel was not a naïve man who was taken in at the drop of a hat, nor was he a fat man who accepts compliments with his mouth wide open. Why did this rascal, who had a reputation for taking the harshness of businessmen to the point of ferocity, take such a sudden interest in him? That remained to be seen. In the meantime, he had to be on his guard.
- I am very touched by your sympathy," he said.
- I want to prove to you that it is real and that it can be effective. You come to me because you need three thousand francs. If I find them for you - and I promise to look for them, even though it seems difficult, very difficult - they will ensure your present rest; but will they ensure your future, that is to say, will they allow you to continue the important work you have just told me about and on which your ambition is counting? No. The struggles in which you are struggling and wearing yourself out will soon begin again. And it is these struggles that you need to get rid of if you are to secure the freedom to work that is essential if you want to walk straight and fast. For this, I see only one way: -- get married.
IV
Saniel, who was on his guard and expecting some sort of cunning on the part of the business agent, had not at all foreseen that these expressions of interest would lead to a proposal of marriage; an exclamation of surprise escaped him. But it was lost in the ringing of the doorbell.
Caffié stood up:
- What a nuisance not to have a clerk!
He went to open the door with an alacrity he had not had for Saniel, and which proved that, not being alone, he no longer had the same fears of introducing someone into his home.
It was a banker who entered.
- If you don't mind," said Caffié, returning to his study and addressing Saniel, "it'll only take a moment.
Under the lamp, the banker was looking in his wallet; he drew out a draft which he presented to Caffié.
- The funds are ready", said the latter.
- With you, Monsieur Caffié, the money is always ready.
Caffié had taken a key from his waistcoat pocket and used it to open the iron box behind his desk, and turning his back to Saniel and the banker, he counted out the notes, the sound of which they could hear. He soon straightened up and, pushing back the door of his box, placed the bundles he had just counted under the lamp. The waiter in turn counted them and, having placed them in his wallet, saluted.
- Pull the door shut on your way out," said Caffié, who had already returned to his chair.
- Don't worry.
As the banker left, Caffié apologised for the interruption.
-- Let's resume our conversation, if you don't mind, my dear sir. I was telling you that there was only one way for you to get out of your predicament for ever, and that you would find it in a good marriage which would put a reasonable sum at your disposal here and now.
- But it would be madness for me to marry at the moment, when I have no position to offer my wife.
- And your future, which you spoke of earlier with such assurance, do you not have faith in it?
- Absolute faith, as firm today as when I entered the fight, but more enlightened. However, as others don't have the same reasons as I do for hoping and believing what I hope and believe, I find it quite natural to doubt this future: which is what you did yourself, just now, when you didn't think it was good enough to guarantee a simple loan of three thousand francs.
- Loans and marriage are not the same thing: a loan only gets you out of trouble momentarily, leaving you with many chances of being obliged to take out several others successively: which, you will agree, singularly attenuates the guarantees you can offer; whereas a marriage immediately opens up the road your ambitious dream has promised to travel.
- I've never thought about marriage.
- What if you did?
- For that you would first need a wife.
- If I offered you one, what would you say?
- Well...
- You're surprised, aren't you?
- I admit I am.
- My dear sir, I am a friend to my clients and to many of them, - dare I say it - a father. This is why, having great affection for a young lady -- and the daughter of a friend of mine, I thought, seeing you and listening to you, that one or the other could be the woman you need; both have wealth, they are intelligent and have physical advantages that a man, a handsome man like you, has the right to demand. Besides, I have their photographs precisely, and you can see for yourselves what they are like.
He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a packet of photographs, which he began to search through. Saniel, who was following him with his eyes, noticed that all the photographs were portraits of women; finally he made his choice and presented Saniel with two cards.
One was of a woman aged between thirty-eight and forty, of strong build and robust appearance, all covered in the horrible jewellery she had worn to have her portrait taken; the other was of a young woman in her twenties, quite pretty, dressed simply and elegantly, with a distinguished and discreet face that contrasted with that of the first portrait.
While Saniel was looking at these portraits, Caffié was examining him, trying to guess the effect his two subjects were producing.
- Now that you've seen them," he said, "let's talk about them a little. If you knew me better, my dear sir, you would know that I am frankness itself and that in business I make it a rule to say everything: the good and the bad, so that my clients alone are responsible for the decisions they make. In reality there is nothing bad about these two people, because if there were, I wouldn't suggest them to you; but in the end there are sides that my delicacy obliges me to point out to you, which I do without worrying, since I am sure that a man like you is not a slave to narrow prejudices.
He made a painful grimace and once again grabbed his jaw with both hands.
- Are you in pain?" asked Saniel.
- Yes, my teeth, cruelly, forgive me for saying so; I know for myself that nothing is more irritating than the sight of someone else's pain.
- Not for doctors, anyway.
- Anyway, let's leave that and get back to my customers. This one," he presented the portrait of the woman with the jewels, "is, as you may have guessed, a widow, a very amiable widow. She may be a few years older than you, but I don't think that's a serious grievance for you to raise, since your life experience has surely taught you that a man who wants to be loved, tenderly loved, pampered, caressed, spoiled, must take a woman who is older than he is, who will treat him like a husband and a son. Her first husband was a skilful merchant who, had he lived, would have made a handsome fortune in the butcher's trade, - this was chewed rather than clearly pronounced, - but who, although he died just as his business was expanding, left his wife twenty thousand pounds in annuities. As I say the good, I must also say the regrettable. Carried away by the company his business required, this highly intelligent man had acquired unfortunate habits of intemperance which, from outside, he had brought into his home and which, in a way, he had imposed on his wife. I have every reason to believe that she has corrected herself; but, if it were otherwise, you, the doctor, could easily cure her of it...
- Do you think so?
- I suppose so. However, as the opposite is possible, you would only have to abandon her to her vice, which would take her over in a fairly short time, and, as the contract would be settled by me with this eventuality in mind, you would find yourself invested with the fortune and rid of the wife.
- Shall we move on to the other?" said Saniel, who had listened uninterrupted to this curious presentation of the situation by Caffié with the utmost bonhomie; however serious the circumstances, he could not help but be amused by this ready-made diplomacy.
- I was waiting for your request," replied the businessman with a grim smile, "and if I told you about this amiable widow, it was more out of a clear conscience than in the hope of succeeding: however free of prejudice one may be, one always retains a few. I understand yours, and what's more, I share them. Fortunately the one I have to talk to you about now does not give rise to grievances of this kind. Take her photograph, my dear sir, and look at it while I speak. Charming physiognomy, isn't it true? Superior education in a fashionable convent. In a word, a pearl to adorn yourself with. Now I'm going to the straw, because there's one. Who doesn't? Daughter of an actress, one of our most graceful genre actresses. When she left the convent, the young girl lived with her mother. It was there, in that heady environment, if you please, that she had an accident. In short, a child, a delicious little boy, whom the father would surely have recognised, such was his esteem for the mother, if he himself had not been married. At least he has secured his fate with a gift of 200,000 francs, so that whoever marries the mother and legitimises the child by subsequent marriage will have the legal right to these two hundred thousand francs until the boy comes of age... if he makes it that far: these little creatures are so fragile! You, as a doctor, know this better than anyone. In the event of misfortune, the father would inherit half of his son's fortune; and while it is cruel for a real father to inherit from a real son, the situation changes completely when it is from a stranger that one receives a fortune. That is the case, my dear sir, clear and frank, and I do you no injustice in supposing that you do not see the advantages of it without needing to insist. If I have not explained myself more clearly...
- But nothing could be clearer.
- ... The fault lies with this fluxion that paralyses me.
He grabbed his jaw and whimpered.
- Do you have a tooth that's causing you pain?" asked Saniel in the tone of a doctor questioning a patient.
- All teeth cause me pain. In fact, they've given up on me.
- Have you consulted a doctor?
- Neither a doctor nor a dentist. Of course I believe in medicine, but when I've gone to doctors, which has rarely happened to me, I've noticed that they think much more about their own business than about what I tell them, and that's what's kept me away from them. But, my dear sir, when a customer comes to see me, I put myself in his place and I get under his skin.
As he spoke, Saniel examined him, which he had not done until that moment, and saw in him signs of rapid emaciation that were quite characteristic; he was floating in his clothes, which were made for a man half as fat as he was now; his face was red and shiny as if it had been covered with a layer of cherry sugar.
- Would you like to show me your teeth?" asked Saniel; "it might be possible to ease your pain.
- Do you think...
His examination didn't take long.
- You often have a dry mouth, don't you?
- He asked.
- Are you very thirsty?
- Really annoying.
- Do you sleep well?
- No, I haven't.
- Do you have trouble seeing?
- Yes, I have.
- Didn't you notice that you were putting sticky stains on your laundry?
- No doubt, but I didn't think it was important.
- Are you eating well?
- I'm devouring; and the more I eat, the thinner I get; I'm turning into a skeleton.
- I see you still have boil scars on the back of your neck.
- They made me suffer enough, the rascals; but they left as they came. You're not young any more at seventy-one, you have your little troubles, because they're just troubles, aren't they?
- Certainly; with a few precautions and a diet that I'll show you, if you don't mind, you'll get rid of them easily. I'm still going to write you a prescription to soothe your toothache.
- We'll talk about the rest again, because we'll have the opportunity to meet again if, as I presume, you appreciate the advantages of the proposal I've made.
- I'd like to think about it.
- Nothing could be fairer; besides, there's no hurry.
- If there is an emergency, it's with me, because if I don't pay Jardine, I find myself on the street, which is not a position to offer a woman.
- In the street, in the street! Things won't go as quickly as that. How are the proceedings going?
- They're about to start; Jardine threatened me with them.
- They're going to start; they haven't started yet. If, as I presume, he proceeds with a seizure-revendication, we'll have time before the judgment. Do you owe anything to your landlord?
- The term expires on the 15th.
- Don't pay him.
- That's easy; it's the only thing that's easy for me.
- It's an obstacle in your Jardine's path that could stop him for a moment. That way we can manoeuvre more easily. The main thing is to let me know as soon as the fire starts. Goodbye then, dear sir.
V
Although Saniel had no experience of business, he was not naive enough not to understand that Caffié, by refusing him this loan, wanted to keep him in close dependence.
- The calculation is simple," he said to himself as he descended the stairs. "He is taking on my defence and conducting it in such a way that one fine day, which is not far off, I can only save myself by holding out my hand to the charming young girl. What a scoundrel!
However, such was the situation, that he should be happy to obtain the help of this scoundrel: at least, it was time saved, and Jardine, seeing that he no longer had a sheep before him willing to let his throat be slit, would perhaps agree to a reasonable arrangement; the only thing was to manoeuvre in such a way that Caffié did not prevent this arrangement.
Unfortunately, he felt unsuited to this manoeuvre, having always been straight ahead, with his eye fixed on his goal, thinking only of the work that would make him achieve it; -- and now he had to improvise himself as a diplomat, bending to finesse, to tricks that were not at all in his brutal nature: He had begun by not immediately telling Caffié what he thought of his proposals; but it is more difficult to act than to contain oneself, to speak than to remain silent. 
What would he say, what would he do, when the moment for action came?
He arrived home without having found anything, and as he passed the concierge's lodge, absorbed in his preoccupation, he heard someone calling him:
- Doctor, would you come in for a moment, please?
He thought it was some consultation they wanted to ask him about, a country awaiting his return as so often happened, and although he was not in a position to listen patiently to idiotic chatter, he retraced his steps and entered the dressing room.
- Cha has been brought in," said the concierge, handing him a sheet of stamped paper covered in handwriting.
Cha was the beginning of the fire that Caffié had mentioned. Without reading it through, Saniel put it in his pocket and prepared to leave, but the concierge stopped him.
- I'd like to say a few words to the doctor about this paper.
- Have you read it?
- Of course not, but I spoke to the bailiff's clerk who gave it to me 'talking to my perch' and he explained the situation to me. That's a shame, doctor!
All Saniel needed was to be pitied by his concierge.
- She's not what we told you," he replied haughtily.
- Well, so much the better! I'm very happy, for you and for me. You can pay me my little bill.
- You can give it to me.
- I've already given it to you twice, but I've done it again; here it is.
Saniel was either paralysed by a creditor's complaint, his mouth agape with humiliation, or he could only respond with clumsiness. Taking the note the concierge handed him, he put it in his pocket and stammered a few words.
-- You see, doctor, I have to tell you what has been in my heart for a long time. You are my country and I think too highly of you not to speak out. By taking your flat, by getting involved with your upholsterer, you've done more than you bargained for: you're wearing yourself out; leave this flat, take the one opposite which costs half as much, and you'll be fine. You won't be forced to abandon the neighbourhood. What would happen to the country if you left us? You're a good doctor, everyone recognises that and says so, including the local people. Now, for my little note, it's agreed that I'll go first, isn't that right?
- As soon as I have the money, I'll pay you.
- Is that agreed?
- You have my word.
- Thank you very much. I'm not rich, you know, and yet I've always paid for the gas for your experiments.
With his stamped paper in his pocket, Saniel returned to Caffié, whom he met under the carriage entrance, where he handed him the bailiff's writ.
- I'll see about it this evening," said the businessman; "for the moment, I'm going to dinner. But don't worry, I'll take care of everything tomorrow morning. Good evening; I'm starving.
If Saniel wasn't starving, he too would have gladly eaten dinner, but three days earlier he had bled himself dry to pay his upholsterer as much as he could on account, keeping only five francs for himself, and it wasn't with the few pennies he had left that he could get into a restaurant or even a gargote, however miserable it was. All he had to do was buy a loaf of bread and eat it while he worked, as he had so often done.
But when he got home, he couldn't get down to the article he had to write and deliver that evening. Among the tasks he had taken on was one, and not the least tedious, which consisted of giving advice by mail to the subscribers of a fashion journal, or, more correctly, recommending it, in the form of medical advice, all cosmetics -- depilatory pastes, elixirs, aromatic waters, tinctures, essences, oils, vinegars, milks, creams, soaps, opiates, ointments, glycerines, vaselines, sachets, pastilles, toothpastes, eye shadow ; and also all the pharmaceutical specialities -- fortifying wines, regenerative pills, pectoral pastes, tars, irons, syrups, purgatives, to which their inventors wanted to give an authority that the public, which thinks it is clever, refuses to give to the simple announcement on the last page. With the ambition he had and the career he wanted to follow, he would never have agreed to write this correspondence under his own name; so for this work he was only the secretary of one of his colleagues who, as a simple local doctor, did not have the same reservations and bravely signed these consultations, finding that clients and money were always good to take, wherever they came from. To make up for his trouble, Saniel replaced his colleague on Sundays in the summer, and from time to time received a free case of perfume or pharmaceutical products, which he sold at a discount when the opportunity arose.
Every week, he was given a list of the cosmetics and specialities that were to feature in his correspondence, and it didn't matter how he recommended them, either by replying to letters that were actually addressed to him, or by inventing questions that would allow him to introduce them more or less appropriately.
He was beginning to consult this list and the bundle of letters from subscribers that the newspaper had sent him, when the doorbell rang; it might have been a sick man, the good sick man he had been waiting for in vain for four years: he left his desk to go and open the door.
It was his coalman, coming to pick up his bill.
- I'll come and see you one of these days," said Saniel; "tonight I'm in a hurry.
- Well, I'm in a hurry too: I've got a deadline tomorrow and I've counted on the doctor.
- I don't have any money here.
- I just want the doctor to give me a deposit.
- I'm telling you I don't have any money here.
- So it's true what they're saying about the doctor being sued by the bailiffs, that he's going to be sold or have his furniture repossessed. He wouldn't want me to lose my money; I'm a family man.
Saniel knew only too well that he was a father, having had to look after this family for four years, made up of a mother and three children who were constantly ill, without there ever being any question of paying him for his visits.
Somehow, after an interminable discussion, he managed to dismiss the coalman, and went back to his office to work on his article.
The first letter he picked up, signed "Parfum de cyclamen", asked for advice on teeth:
"Cyclamen scent. -- Give up your toothpaste, which is dangerous and will make you lose all your teeth before you are five, and switch to the Durand pharmacy, 215, rue Richelieu, whose good effects I guarantee...
"A pale young woman. -- The operation is radical, without danger to the skin or health; but it must be performed by a hand skilled in handling electricity. Come and see me, 117, Chaussée-d'Antin, from two to four o'clock; I'll be delighted to see you.
It wasn't him, Saniel, but his colleague, the one who signed this correspondence and who, by using these baits, was attracting a few customers.
He was about to move on to the third letter, signed: "Une affligée de vingt ans", when the doorbell rang again. This time he wouldn't open the door: another creditor, no doubt. And he wrote down his advice.
And yet? For the last four years, he had been waiting for a lucky ticket in life's lottery: a rich patient, suffering from a cyst or tumour, whom he took to a fashionable surgeon, who would share the ten or fifteen thousand francs, the price of the operation, with him. Then he was saved.
He ran to his door. The patient with the cyst appeared in the form of a little bearded man with a flaming face, wearing over his jacket the thick black canvas apron worn by wine merchants. It was, in fact, the local wine merchant who, having also learned the truth from the bailiff, had come to collect his small bill for wine and portions supplied over the last three months for the doctor's lunches.
The scene that had taken place with the coal merchant began again, more lively, more violent, and Saniel had to get angry and threaten to throw out the wine merchant, who only left promising to come back the next day with his bailiff.
Saniel resumed his article:
"A Parisienne in perspective. -- Since you will soon be coming to Paris, I will postpone my prescription until you arrive: not all explanations are worth a glance. Let your first visit be to 117 de la Chaussée-d'Antin: you're sure to find me between two and four.
"Between parakeet and marmoset. -- Make use of the sachets of toiletries from the Magnolia perfumery, they will delay your wrinkles, which you are certainly exaggerating, your style says so."
His pen was running over the paper when the sound of footsteps made him look up: either he had locked his door on the wine merchant's back, or it was his servant who had just come in with his key... So what did he want? He didn't use it all day, but only at the time of his consultation, for housework and to open the door for customers when they came in.
As he was about to get up to see who it was, a knock came at the door: it was indeed his servant, looking sheepish and embarrassed.
- What is it, Joseph?
- I thought I'd find the gentleman, so I came.
- Why did you come?
Joseph hesitated; then, taking courage, he said volubly, keeping his eyes lowered:
- I've come to ask the gentleman to pay me my month's rent, which is due on the 15th, because the house needs money right away; if we didn't need money, I wouldn't have come.
Saniel looked at him.
- Don't you know that a bailiff left some stamped paper with the concierge?
- Who could have told him that?
- Do you know or don't you?
- Well, it's true; so, as when the bailiffs are somewhere they raid everything, I thought that monsieur, who is so fair, wouldn't want me to lose my poor money that I've had so much trouble earning. So I came, and here I am.
- Well, I don't have any money; if I had, I would have paid the bailiff.
- So I have to lose my wages?
- I'll pay you later.
- When will that be?
- As soon as I can.
- Will the bailiffs let you do that? They're going to sell everything here. If the gentleman would like, I'll hold him harmless...
- How would you do that?
- I'd take the frock coat that the gentleman had made for me two months ago; of course it's not worth what I'm owed, but it would still be something.
- Take the frock-coat with you.
Joseph quickly took his frock coat from the hall cupboard where it was hanging, and rolled it up in a newspaper.
- So Monsieur won't be counting on me tomorrow," he said, putting his key in a chest; "I'll have to look for a job.
- That's fine, I won't count on you.
- Good evening, sir.
And Joseph left as quickly as possible.
Left alone, Saniel did not go back to work straight away; but, falling back into his armchair, he cast a melancholy gaze around his study and into the living room, whose door had been left open: in the dim light of his candle, he could see his big armchairs methodically lined up on either side of the fireplace, the draperies of the windows drowned in shadow and all the furniture that had cost him so much effort over the last four years. It was this junk Louis XIV that he had been a prisoner of for so long, and by whom he was now going to be executed. What a clever and skilful affair! All that had served only poor Auvergnats, and he himself had not enjoyed it, not having the bourgeois taste for knick-knacks, nor the need for well-being. A movement of anger and revolt against himself made him slam his fist down on his desk: how naive he had been!
The doorbell rang again. This time he wouldn't hear it, as he was no longer counting on the rich client.
After a brief moment, the doorbell was gently tapped. He got up quickly and ran to open the door.
A woman threw herself around his neck:
- Ah, my darling, how happy I am to find you home.
VI
She had put an arm round his waist and, snuggling up to him, they had entered the study.
- I'm so glad," she repeated, "what a good idea I've had!
And with a sudden movement she got rid of the long grey frock coat that wrapped her up to her feet.
- And you, are you happy?" she said, standing in front of him to get a better look.
- Can you ask?
- Just to hear you say it.
- Aren't you my only joy, the soft light that illuminates me at the bottom of the pit where I dig day and night!
- Dear Victor!
She was a tall, slender young woman with chestnut-coloured hair in thick curls that reached all the way to her eyebrows. Beautiful dark eyes, a short nose, superb teeth and gums the colour of strawberries gave her the air of a pretty dog; she had the gaiety, the vivacity, the graceful effrontery, the passionate caress of the gaze. Dressed to the nines, like a penniless Parisian who adorns everything she wears, she had a casualness and a natural elegance that charmed: she had a good-natured tone, a joyful laugh and an expression of sensitivity spread across her fresh face.
- I'll come and have dinner with you," she said cheerfully, "and I'm hungry!
He let out a movement that she caught.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- Not at all.
- Do you have to go out?
- No, I don't have to go out.
- Then why did you make a movement that betrayed boredom or at least embarrassment?
- You're wrong, my little Philis.
- With anyone else I might be wrong, but with you, is it possible? You know very well that between us there is no need for words, that I can read in your eyes what you are going to say, in your face what you are thinking and feeling. Isn't it always like that when we love... as I love you?
He took her in his arms and kissed her for a long time; then, going to an armchair on which he had thrown his overcoat when he came in, he took out of a pocket the bread he had bought.
- Here's my dinner," he said, pointing to the bread.
- Oh, I must scold you: work is making you lose your head. Can't you take time to eat?
He smiled sadly:
- I've had plenty of time.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out three large pennies he had left:
- You can't eat out on sixpence.
She threw herself at him:
- Oh, darling, forgive me," she cried. Poor dear martyr, dear great man, it is I who accuse you, when I should be kissing your knees. And you don't scold me; a sad smile is your answer. So there you are: not even enough to eat!
- You can eat very well with bread; I'm sure I'll always have some!
- Well, today I want you to have more and better. This morning, when I saw the bad weather, I had an idea that involved you: it's quite natural, since you're never out of my heart or out of my mind: I told Mum that, if the gale continued, I would sleep at the boarding house. You can imagine the emotion with which I listened to the wind all day, watching the rain fall mixed with the leaves and dead branches that whirled past. Thank God the weather was bad enough for Mum to think I'd be safe at the boarding house, and here I am, yours until tomorrow morning. But as we won't be able to stay sober until then on just your bread, I'm going to go and buy some dinner; we'll have dinner by the fire, which will be much more fun than going to the restaurant.
She quickly put on her frock coat.
- Set the table while I do my shopping.
- I've got my article to finish, which we're going to collect at eight o'clock; don't forget that I've still got three tonic wines to recommend, five iron preparations, a henna tincture, a breast milk, two hair lotions, an opiate, I don't know how many soaps and rice powders, and they've got to be included in my article, whether by force or by choice. What a job!
- Well, don't worry about the table; we'll set it together when you've finished, which will only be more fun.
- You take everything in stride!
- Is it better to look at it from the wrong side? See you later!
She was about to pull the door open.
- Don't do anything foolish," he said.
- There's no danger," she replied, tapping her pocket.
Then, coming back to him, she kissed him passionately:
- Work.
And she ran off.
They had been in love for two years. At that time, Saniel went every week to a boarding house near Paris to give an anatomy course for girls preparing for the Hôtel de Ville exams, and every time he met a young woman he couldn't help noticing: She left and returned at the same times as he did, and gave lessons in the boarding house rival to the one where he taught: as she often carried under her arm a large cardboard box or sometimes a plaster cast, he had conjectured, without needing to make an effort, that it was drawing that she was teaching. At first he hadn't paid any attention to her: he didn't care about this drawing teacher; he had other things on his mind than women. But little by little, precisely because she was discreet and reserved, he had been struck by the vivacity and cheerfulness of her face: it was a real pleasure to look at this pretty and above all pleasant young woman. However, he hadn't let on what he thought of her: if their eyes smiled at each other when they met, that was all; they didn't know each other at all. When he took the left-hand pavement, he was sure she would take the right, and vice versa. Things went on like this for several months without a word being exchanged between them: only by force of circumstance had they both learnt who they were: She was the daughter of a painter who had been dead for seven or eight years and who had enjoyed a certain reputation. He was a doctor with a promising future, a very strong man who would one day be seen at work. These reasons had arisen by chance: One summer day when the weather had suddenly turned stormy at the hour when they usually took the train back, Saniel, returning to the railway, had joined Miss Philis Cormier on the way, whom he saw hurrying ahead of him; they still had five or six hundred metres to cover across a plain without houses before arriving at the station, i.e. more than enough time to be flooded if the black clouds rolled by the wind decided to burst: He had an umbrella that had just been lent to him when he left the boarding house; she had none. For the first time, he decided to speak to her:
- You don't have an umbrella: would you allow me to walk beside you? I'll shelter you with the one they've just lent me.
She replied with a smile, and they walked side by side until the rain came down; then she came closer to him, and they entered the station chatting happily:
- Your umbrella is better than Virginie's skirt," she said.
- What is Virginie's skirt?
-- Haven't you read Paul and Virginie?
- No, I haven't.
She had looked at him with a slightly mocking smile, wondering what very strong people could read.
Not only had Saniel never read Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's novel, no more that one than any other for that matter, but he had never even liked it, since the things of the heart were no more his doing than those of the imagination. Leisure is needed for pleasure reading, and even more so for love, just as it needs a freedom of spirit and an independence of life that he did not have. Where would he have found the time to read novels? When and how would he have cared for a woman? The women he had had since his arrival in Paris had never had the slightest influence on him, and he had not kept a distinct memory of any of them. On the contrary, thinking of that walk in the rain, he had rediscovered that young girl with a sureness of memory that was quite extraordinary for him; the impression had therefore been so strong that it continued: he saw Philis again with her smile that uncovered her dazzling teeth, he heard the music of her voice, and that monotonous plain, which he had crossed so often without ever seeing her, appeared to him as the most beautiful landscape in the world. For the first time, he had realised that the hollow, muscular conoid organ known as the heart could serve a purpose other than the circulation of blood.
What a surprise and disappointment! Was he going to be naive enough to love this young girl and entangle a woman in a life that was already so difficult and so full? Quite an affair, really, and how nature had built him to play the lover! It's true that only those who want it become lovers, and from experience he knew the strength of will.
But this self-confidence soon had to give way: away from Philis, he could do as he pleased; near her, it was she who wanted; with one look she was master of him; he arrived furious at the influence she had taken over him, and against which he had struggled since they had last seen each other; he left her delighted to feel how deeply he loved her.
For a man whose life had hitherto been governed by reason and logic, these contradictions were exasperating, and he could only forgive himself for enduring them by telling himself that they could in no way alter the course of action he had set himself, nor make him deviate from the path he was following.
Rich, or simply with a little fortune, he could have - when he was close to her and in her power - let himself be dragged along; but it was not when he was starving that he was going to do the folly of taking a wife; what would he have to give her? his misery, nothing but his misery; and shame, for want of any other reason, would prevent him from offering her anything ever again.
Since they had known each other, she herself had quite naturally, in conversation, added to the information he had first had: she was indeed, as he had been told, the daughter of a painter; her father, who had had a difficult start, had died just as, after years of hard struggle, he was coming into his own; ten more years of work and he would have left his family, if not wealth, at least a great deal of ease. In reality, all he had left them was ruin; the hotel he had built had been sold and their debts paid off, leaving them with nothing but a few pieces of furniture. They had had to work, and there were three of them, a mother, a son and a daughter; the mother, who had no trade, had taken up linen work; the son had left school to become a clerk for a businessman called Caffié; the daughter, who fortunately for her had learnt to draw and paint under her father's guidance, had sought lessons, and, to add to the little she earned, she designed dinner menus for paper manufacturers and painted boxes and fans on silk: The brother, tired of his sad existence and the toil imposed on him by his businessman, had just left them to try his luck in America. If Saniel ever married, which he doubted, he would certainly not marry a woman in these circumstances.
This thought reassured him, and he gave himself over to her a little more; why shouldn't he enjoy the sweet pleasure of seeing and hearing her? He felt perfectly sure of himself and, as he knew her now, he was just as sure of her: a good, honest girl; besides, how could she have guessed that he loved her?
So they continued to see each other with a pleasure that seemed equal on both sides, going to meet each other as soon as they saw each other at the station, waiting for each other, getting into the same carriage, always arranging to travel together on the outward and return journeys, and chatting freely and cheerfully, forgetting the weather so well that it was rare for their arrival not to surprise them.
Things had gone on like this until the holidays approached, meaning a momentary separation, and a little before then they had decided that after their last lesson, instead of taking the train to the station as usual, they would go a league away to return to Paris by tram, which would give them a good hour's walk through the woods.
The sun was hot that day: halfway along, Philis asked to rest for a moment; they sat down in a copse, and soon found themselves in each other's arms.
Since then, Saniel had never spoken of marriage and Philis had never said anything of her own.
They loved each other.
VII
Saniel was still at work when Philis came in.
- Haven't you finished yet, poor dear?
- Time enough to treat by correspondence an illness for which the careful examination of ten doctors might not be enough, and I'm all yours.
In three lines the deal was done; he left his office:
- Here I am: what do you want me to do?
- Help me take out what's in my pockets.
She had already got rid of a bottle wrapped in a sheet of paper and placed it on the desk.
- You're so heavy!
- Just the right amount.
She had parcels under her arms, and the pockets of her frock coat and dress seemed full: it was a job to empty them.
- Don't squeeze too hard," she said to each packet he took from her.
In the end, the pockets were empty.
- Where shall we dine?
- Here, because the dining room has been turned into a laboratory.
- Well, let's start with the fire; I got my feet wet wading through the road to the station.
- I don't know if there's any wood.
- Let's have a look.
She took the candle and they went into the kitchen, which, just as the dining room was a laboratory, was also a stable where Saniel kept guinea pigs and rabbits in cages for his experiments, and where Joseph piled up everything that bothered him, without having to worry about the stove or the grill, which had never been lit. There were old brooms, shoe polish brushes, cabbages for the rabbits, carrots for the guinea pigs, piles of newspapers, crates and boxes.
- Do you care about these boxes?" she asked, stroking a little pig she had held in her arms.
- Not at all; they were used to pack perfume and pharmaceutical specialities; they're useless now.
- Well, you can make a lovely fire with these boards; broken up, they'll make a nice, bright, blazing fire.
Saniel took it and quickly split enough boxes to have a good supply of wood.
- What it's like to be from Auvergne!" she said, laughing; "it's as if you're all born with the genius for charcoal-burning.
- So you're making fun of me?
- No, but you chop your wood seriously, gloomily, as if you were skinning a sick man, and I'd like to make you laugh a little, by laughing at you myself, at me, at anyone, as long as you lighten up.
They returned to the study, Saniel carrying the supply of wood.
- Now let's set the table," she said cheerfully.
A small folding pedestal table was placed in front of the window, and Saniel often used it for lunch, with the matching plate that Joseph would fetch for her from the butcher's, or with the portion provided by the wine merchant who, a few moments earlier, had come to make a scene with her; she took it and brought it in front of the fireplace where she opened it.
- Where's the washing?
- I'm not rich in linen, but in this cupboard I have towels that I spread over the chests and shoulders of the people I examine; let's see if there are any clean ones.
There were four left, which was one more than I needed.
- Do you have plates, knives, forks and glasses?
- Yes, in a cupboard in the dining room.
- Let's go and get them.
This dining room, where we had never eaten, was the most curiously furnished room in the flat. No table, no chairs, no sideboard; but along the wall, white wooden boards forming shelves, and on these boards, matras, balloons, horizontal or vertical effilure flasks, culture tubes, filters, a gas oven, a microscope, slices of bread, pieces of potato, here and there jars, vials, and also a few books, in short the equipment of a small bacteriological research laboratory: This was the room where Saniel worked more often and for longer than in his consulting room. 
The five or six plates, three knives and glasses that made up Saniel's crockery and glassware were kept in a cupboard.
- Are you sure there aren't any germs on the plates?" asked Philis as she took what she needed to serve the table.
- I hope not.
- Well, if you wipe them clean.
Philis promptly set the table, coming and going, circling the table with a graceful lightness that Saniel admired.
- So you do nothing," she said.
- I look at you and think.
- And the result of these reflections, can we ask?
- It's that in you there's a fund of good humour and gaiety, an exuberance of life that would cheer up a man on death row.
- And what would have become of us, I beg you, if I had been a melancholic and despondent person when we lost my poor dad? He was a joy to be around, singing all day long, waking up with a song on his lips and, while working, laughing and joking, never for a minute in a bad mood. I was brought up by him and close to him, and I look like him. When, in the space of a few days, he was taken away from us, you can imagine how we were devastated, falling from this happy life into distress and grief; Mum, as you know, is melancholic and restless, shy and inclined to see everything in black; my brother Florentin is like her. It was a time of dreary despair: Mum kept saying from morning till night that all we had to do was die of hunger; my brother wanted to join the army; I didn't give up, and although I couldn't laugh or sing, I did stir myself up enough to shake off the numbness of despair: I got Florentin a job, I found work for Mum, and I found some for myself too.
She looked at him with a smile that said: "Will you let me do for you what I did for them?
But she did not say these precise words; on the contrary, she immediately tried to erase their impression if, as she believed, he had guessed them.
- Go and fetch some water," she said; "in the meantime, I'll light the fire; now's the time.
When he returned with a full decanter, the fire was blazing, casting golden fizzes that lit up the study. Sitting at the desk, Philis was writing.
- What are you doing here?" he asked in surprise.
- I'm writing our menu, because you can imagine that we're not going to sit down to a bourgeois dinner like that. Here it is: what do you think.
She read out loud:
- Sardines from Nantes. -- Roast turkey leg. -- Terrine of foie gras pâté with Périgord truffles". But this is a feast, your dinner!
- Did you think I was going to offer you a portion of fricandeau au jus?
She continued:
- Brie cheese. -- Vanilla cream puffs. -- Normandy apple. -- Wine..."
- Ah! voilà. What wine? I wouldn't want to deceive you. Let's say: "Wine from the local wine merchant." And now, to the table.
As he was about to sit down, she stopped him:
- Aren't you going to take my arm and lead me to my seat? If we don't do things seriously, methodically, we won't believe it, and the Périgord truffles might turn into little black pieces of anything.
When they were sitting opposite each other with their napkins unfolded, she continued her joke:
-- Are you going to the performance of Don Juan on Monday, my dear doctor?
And Saniel, who in spite of everything had kept a sombre expression on his face, began to laugh frankly.
- Come on!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together. No more worrying, no more worrying! Put your eyes in mine, dear Victor, and let's think only of the present moment, of the joy of being together, of our love. Is that all?
She held out her hand to him over the table.
He took it and shook it:
- It's said.
The dinner continued merrily, Saniel responding to the smiles and gaiety of Philis, who led the conversation without letting it languish: she served him, poured him a drink, and there was a burst of voices and laughter the like of which this cabinet had never heard; from time to time, she left her chair and threw a handful of wood into the fire, which, half extinguished, resumed its fizzing.
However, she noticed that little by little Saniel's face, relaxed for a moment, darkened and took on the expression of concern and bitterness that she had found so hard to banish.
- Doesn't this charming dinner party give you the idea of starting up again soon?
- Start again! But how? Where could I?
- But if I was able to come this evening without Mum worrying, I'll find some way, some excuse, to start again next week.
He shook his head.
- You won't be free next week?" she asked, worried.
- Where will I be next week, tomorrow, in a few days' time?
- You're scaring me! Please explain. Oh, Victor, have pity on me, don't leave me in anguish.
- You're right; I must tell you everything and not let your tenderness seek explanations for my worries, which can only torment you.
- If you have worries, don't you value me enough to share them with me? You know very well that I am yours, all yours, today, tomorrow and forever!
Without letting her ignore the difficulties of his situation, he had never gone into specific details, preferring to talk about his hopes rather than his present misery.
He repeated the story he had already told Glady and Caffié, adding what had just happened with the concierge, the wine merchant, the coalman and Joseph.
She listened in shock.
- He's taken the frock-coat!" she murmured.
- That's the only reason he came.
- And what about tomorrow?
- Ah, tomorrow... tomorrow!
- With so much work, how could you have got there?
- Like you, I believed in the virtue of work, and here I am! Because I felt in myself a will that nothing would weaken, a strength that nothing would weary, a courage that nothing would discourage, I imagined that I was armed for the fight, so that I couldn't be defeated, and I know it, as much through the fault of circumstances as through my own...
- And what are you guilty of, poor dear?
- Ignorance of life, clumsiness, presumption, blindness. If I had been less naive, would I have let myself be taken in by Jardine's proposals? Would I have accepted this furniture, this flat? He told me that the commitments he had me sign were mere formalities, that in reality I would pay him when I could, that he would be satisfied with an honest interest: this seemed plausible to me; I didn't look any further and I accepted, happy, glorious to be settling down... certain that I was strong enough to carry this burden. Self-confidence is a strength, but it's also a weakness. Because you love me, you don't know me, you don't see me. In reality, I'm not very sociable, and I'm absolutely lacking in flexibility, finesse and politeness, both in character and in manners: how, with that, do you expect to do business and be successful if you don't make a splash? I'm counting on it, but it's not time yet. Because I lack flexibility, I have not been able to win the sympathy or the interest of my masters; they only saw my stiffness, and, as I did not go to them, even more out of shyness than pride, they did not come to me, -- which is quite natural, I agree; moreover, as I did not bow my ideas to the authority of some, they took a dislike to me, which is even more natural. Because I lack politeness and have remained for many things the heavy and awkward Auvergnat that nature made me, the people of the world have disdained me, sticking to the bark they saw and which displeased them. If I had been wiser, smarter and more experienced, I would at least have been able to rely on comradeship; but I didn't care. What was the point? I didn't need it: my strength was enough for me; I thought it was better to be feared than to be loved. Thus built, I had only two choices: either to stay in my poor room at the Hôtel du Sénat, living on lessons and bookshop jobs until the day of the competitive examination for the central office and the agrégation; or to set up in an eccentric district, in Belleville, Montrouge or elsewhere, and there to build up my clientele with the strength of my hocks with people who would not ask me to be polite or well-mannered. As these parties were reasonable, I took neither one nor the other: -- Belleville because I wanted to work only with my legs, like one of my comrades whom I saw working at La Villette: "Your tongue. -- Good. -- Your arm. -- Good! And while he was supposed to be feeling his patient's pulse, with his other hand he wrote out his prescription: "Vomiting, purgative... -- It's forty sous. -- And off he goes, never wasting five minutes on his diagnosis: he hasn't got the time; -- the Hôtel du Sénat, because I'd had enough, and Jardine's proposals were tempting me. That's where he took me.
- And now what?
VIII
At that moment, the candle that lit the table went out in the torch, without its flickering light, which had been flickering for a few moments, having warned them that it was going to die. Philis stood up:
- Where are the candles?" she asked.
- There are none left; this was the last one.
- Well, all we have to do is light the fire.
She threw a small handful of wood into the hearth; then, instead of taking her chair, she went and found a cushion on the sofa and, placing it in front of the fireplace, she sat down on it, leaning on Saniel's knee.
- And now," she repeated, looking up at him.
- Now, I suppose all I have to do is run off to the Auvergne and become a country doctor.
- My God, is that possible?" she murmured in a tone that surprised Saniel; for, if there was pain in her cry, there was also another feeling that he did not understand.
- When I left the École, I could continue to live at the Hôtel du Sénat and, by giving lessons for a living, prepare for my competitive examinations; now, after having occupied a position of some prominence, can I return to this existence of a beggar student? My creditors, who have already fallen upon me here, will harass me and my competitors in the competition will exploit my misery... which has no other cause than my vices; they will find that I would dishonour the Faculty and I will be rejected. Neither a hospital doctor nor an agrégé, I'd be reduced to being a local doctor; what's the point? The test was done here; you see how well it went.
- So you'd leave?
- Not without heartbreak, not without despair, because that would mean our separation and the renunciation of the hopes on which I have lived for ten years, the abandonment of my work, death; you see now why, despite your cheerfulness, I didn't have the strength to hide my concern from you: the more charming you were, the more I felt how dear you were to me, the more I despaired of this separation.
- Why separate us?
- What is it you want?
She turned to him:
- To go with you. I want you to bear witness to the fact that up until now I have never spoken to you about marriage and never even hinted that you might one day make me your wife. In the position you found yourself in, in the struggle you were waging, a wife would have been a burden that would have paralysed you, especially when that wife was just a poor miserable creature like me, who brought only her misery and that of her family as a dowry. But conditions are no longer the same: here you are, just as miserable and even more desperate; in your country, where all you have are distant relatives who are nothing to you, since they have neither your education, nor your ideas, nor your needs, nor your habits, what are you going to become all alone with your disappointments and your regrets? If you accept me, I'll go with you; when there are two of us and we love each other, we'll never be unhappy. When you come home tired, you'll find me smiling; when you stay at home, you'll involve me in your thoughts, in your work, and I'll try to understand you. I'm not afraid of poverty, you know, and I'm not afraid of solitude either; wherever we are together, I'll be fine. All I ask is that you take my mother with us, because you know I can't abandon her; by looking after her, you've got to know her well enough to know that she's neither troublesome nor difficult; as for Florentin, he'll stay in Paris where he'll find work: his trip to America has mellowed him and his ambitions are now easy to satisfy: making a modest living is all he asks. No doubt we'll be a burden on you, but not as heavy as you might think at first sight: a woman, when she wants to, brings order and economy to a house, and I promise you that I'll be that woman. And then I'll work: I'm sure that my stationer will give me menus just as well when I'm in Auvergne as he does in Paris. I'll probably also be able to get some other work; it's a hundred francs a month, maybe a hundred and fifty, maybe even two hundred. Until you've built up a clientele, we'll live on the money; life in the Auvergne must be cheap.
She had taken both his hands and was anxiously watching the effect of his words on his face, lit by the capricious flame of the fireplace: it was their lives that were about to be decided, and the emotion that gripped her heart made her voice tremble. What was he going to say? She could see his face flustered, but she couldn't read any further.
As she remained silent, he freed both his hands and, taking her head, looked at her in silence for a few moments:
- How you love me!
- Give me some way of proving it other than in words.
- It would be cowardice to associate you with my misery.
- It would be esteeming me enough to be sure that I would be happy.
- But what about me?
- Won't love in your heart win out over pride? Don't you feel that since I've been in love with you my love has taken over my whole life, and that nothing in the world but what is him, what is you, exists in the present or in the future! Because I see you for a few hours now and then in Paris, I am happy; whatever the difficulties that await us, I will be even happier in the Auvergne, simply because we will always see each other.
He remained silent for a long time:
- Could you love me there?" he murmured.
This question, which summed up his thoughts, was obviously addressed more to him than to her.
- Oh, dear Victor!" she cried, "why do you doubt me? Have I deserved it? Don't the past and the present answer for the future?
He shook his head:
- The man you have loved, whom you love, has never shown himself to you as he really is. Despite the difficulties and sadness of his life, he was able to smile at you because, however cruel that life may have been, he was sustained by hope and confidence; in Auvergne there will be no more hope or confidence, only the rage of a shattered existence and the overwhelm of powerlessness. What kind of man would I be? Could you love him?
- A thousand times more, because he would be unhappy and I would have to support him.
- Would you have the strength? In the long run, you would grow weary, because the weight would be too heavy, no matter how great your devotion, no matter how deep your tenderness. Look at my situation, look at my hopes and, going down into the future, look at my crushing. You know I'm ambitious, but only vaguely, don't you? Without ever having measured the scope of that ambition and the hopes, the dreams, if you like, on which it rests. Understand that these dreams are about to come true: in two more months, in December or January, I will take the competitive examination for the central office, which will make me a hospital doctor, and at the same time the competitive examination for the agrégation, which will open the Faculty of Medicine to me. Without any proud illusions, I think I'm in a position to succeed -- what sports people call in condition. So when all I had left to do was wait a few days, I was defeated forever.
- Why forever?
- You come from your village to Paris to make your mark, you don't come back when bad luck or impotence have sent you back. Besides, it's only every four years that a competitive examination for the agrégation is held. In four years' time, what would my moral or intellectual condition have been like; how would I have endured this four-year exile; can you imagine what four years of isolation deep in the mountains can produce? But that's not all. In addition to this ostensible goal that I have been pursuing since I left my village, I have my work in progress, which absolutely requires Paris. Without my ever having knocked you on the head with medicine, you know, don't you? that it is on the eve of undergoing a revolution that will transform it. Until now, it has been officially taught in pathology that the human organism carries within itself the germ of a large number of infectious diseases which develop spontaneously under certain conditions: thus, tuberculosis is the result of fatigue, deprivation and physiological misery. Well, for some time now, revolutionaries have been admitting that these diseases have a parasitic origin, and there is a whole army in France, Germany and Europe looking for these parasites. I am a soldier in this army, and it is for this research that I use this laboratory set up in the dining room. It's the parasites of tuberculosis and cancer that I've been working on, and in the case of cancer, for seven years already, which, when I was an intern, led my comrades to call me "the cancer topical". As for tuberculosis, I've managed to discover its parasite, but not yet to rid it of all its impurities using cultivation techniques. That's where I'm at. In other words, I'm on fire, and perhaps tomorrow, in a few days' time, I'll have made a revolutionary discovery that will bring glory to the man who made it. In the same way, I've found the micro-organism that causes cancer. But that's not the whole story. And that's what I have to give up when I leave Paris.
- Why give up? Can't you continue your research in Auvergne?
- It's impossible for all sorts of reasons too long to explain, but one will suffice. These parasites can only be cultivated at certain temperatures that are rigorously maintained at the required level, and these temperatures can only be obtained in ovens like the one in my laboratory, fed by gas whose inlet is automatically regulated by the amount of heat in the water. How do you expect this oven to work in a country where there is no gas? No, no, if I leave Paris, it's all over: my position as well as my work; I become a village doctor and nothing but a village doctor. If the bailiffs throw me out tomorrow, everything I've accumulated over the last four years in this laboratory, all my work in progress, everything that's finished and everything that needs just a few more days, just a few more hours, will go to the junk shop or be thrown out on the street. So much effort, so many nights spent, so much hardship, so many hopes, all that remains is a memory... for me. And even if it didn't, perhaps I'd be less exasperated and accept with a less ulcerated heart the life I'll never resign myself to. You know very well that I am a rebel, not a resigner.
She stood up and took his hand, squeezing it tightly:
- You must stay in Paris," she said. Forgive me for insisting earlier on proving to you that you could live in your village. I was thinking of myself more than you, of our love, of our marriage; it was a selfish thought, a bad thought. You have to look for a way, any way, whatever it may cost, not to give up your work.
- We must! But how? Do you think I haven't exhausted everything?
He recounted his approaches to Jardine, his requests, his prayers and also his request for a loan from Glady, and finally his visit to Caffié.
- Caffié!" she exclaimed, "how did you get the idea of approaching Caffié?
- Because you'd often spoken to me about him.
- But I spoke of him as the hardest and meanest of men, capable of anything except what is good and what is right.
- And also because I knew from one of my clients that he lent money to those he could exploit.
- And he told you?
- That he would probably not find anyone to grant the loan I wanted; however, he promised to look into it, and he should give me an answer tomorrow evening; he also promised to defend me against Jardine.
- You've put yourself in his hands!
- What do you want? In my position, I don't have the freedom to turn to anyone who I want and who inspires confidence in me because he's honourable. If I go to a notary or a banker, they won't listen to me, because at the first word I'll be obliged to tell them that I have no pledge or guarantee to offer. That's why unfortunate people fall prey to scoundrels; at least those scoundrels listen to them and give them something, no matter how small.
- What did he give you?
- His advice.
- And did you accept it?
- That's always time saved. Maybe tomorrow I'll be out on the street: Caffié will get me some respite.
- And what price will you pay for this defence?
- Only those who have something worry about the price.
- You have your name, your rest, your dignity, your honour, and once you're in Caffié's hands, who knows what he'll demand of you, what he'll force you to do that you can't resist!
- So you want me to leave Paris?
- No, of course not; but I do want you to be on your guard against Caffié, whom you don't know and whom I know from everything Florentin told us when he was at home. No matter how secretive he is, a businessman can't hide from his clerk: Caffié is guilty not only of dirty tricks, but also of real crimes; I can assure you that he deserves to be killed ten times over. To earn a hundred francs he's capable of anything: he has to win, he has to amass, just for the pleasure of amassing, since he has no children, no parents, no heirs.
- Well, I promise to be on my guard, as you advise me; but, however rascal Caffié may be, I think I must accept the help he has offered me. Who knows what might happen during the time he will buy me? Because I don't have to tell you, do I, that I know in advance his answer to the loan I asked him for: he won't have found anyone.
- I'll still come tomorrow evening to find out his answer.
IX
Although Saniel had no illusions about Caffié's reply, he went the next day, at the same time as the day before, to ring the businessman's doorbell.
As on the previous day, he had to wait quite a long time for the door to open; finally he heard a shuffling step on the pavement.
- Who's there?" asked Caffié.
As soon as Saniel answered, the bolt was pulled.
- As I don't like to be disturbed in the evening by intruders," said Caffié, "I don't always open; but I have a signal for my customers that allows me to recognise them: after ringing the bell, you strike your finger against the wood of the door with three equally-spaced knocks.
During this explanation, Saniel had entered the businessman's office.
- Have you taken care of my request?" he said after a moment's delay, as Caffié seemed determined not to initiate the discussion first.
- Yes, my dear sir, I've been running all morning on your behalf; I never neglect my clients, their business is my business.
He paused for a moment.
- Well?" asked Saniel.
Caffié gave his face a desolate expression.
- What did I tell you, my dear sir, please remember? An experience like mine does not speak lightly, do me the honour of believing that. Well, what I predicted has come true: everywhere the same response: the risk is too great; nobody wants to take the chance.
- Even for a large stake?
- Even for a big interest: there is so much competition in your profession. I believe in your future and I proved it to you with my proposal; but, unfortunately, I am only the intermediary and not the provider of funds.
Caffié insisted on the word 'my proposal' and emphasised it with his eyes; but Saniel did not seem to understand.
- What about the upholsterer's summons?
- Your landlord, who is owed a term, will intervene, and your creditor will have to pay him off before going any further. Will he resign himself to this? That remains to be seen. If so, we'll defend ourselves on another ground. I'm not saying victoriously, but in order to gain time.
- How much time?
- That, my dear sir, I cannot know: it depends on our adversary and his advice. And what do you mean by 'how much time'?
- I mean until April.
- So it is eternity. So do you think you'll be able to free yourself in April? If you have that hope - based on guarantees - you have to say so, my dear sir.
This question was asked in a very benevolent tone, which Saniel accepted.
- I have no such guarantees," he said; "but, on the other hand, it would be of the utmost importance to me if the matter were to drag on any longer. As I explained to you, I'm on the eve of taking two competitive exams; they last three months; and in March, or April at the latest, I can be a hospital doctor and an associate of the Faculty. If that's the case, I'll then offer a surface to the lenders, which will no doubt enable you to find me the sum I need to pay Jardine and the expenses that will have been incurred, including your fees.
As he spoke, Saniel realised that he was wrong to give himself up in this way, but he went through with it.
- I would be unworthy of your trust, my dear sir," replied Caffié, "if I kept you thinking that we could win this time. Whatever it costs me -- and it costs me a lot, I assure you -- I must tell you that it is impossible, radically impossible: a few days, yes, perhaps a few weeks, but that's all.
- Well, get me those few weeks," said Saniel, rising to his feet, "that will always be something.
- And after that?
- Until then, we'll see.
- My dear sir, don't go; you wouldn't believe how deeply your position touches me; I'm only thinking of you. When I saw that I really couldn't find the money you needed, I went to pay a friendly visit to my young client, the one I told you about...
- Who has received a higher education in a fashionable convent?
- Precisely; and I asked her what she would think of a young doctor with a promising future, a future professor at the Faculty, already considered to be a first-rate scientist, handsome -- for you are handsome, my dear sir, it is not flattery to say so -- in good health, a peasant by birth, who would present himself as her husband. She seemed flattered, I can tell you frankly. But she immediately said to me: "And the little one? To which I replied that I knew you to be too great, too noble, too generous not to have that indulgence of superior men which makes them accept with serenity an involuntary fault. Have I gone too far?
He didn't wait for an answer:
- No, wasn't it? In fact, the little one was there, because the mother watches over him with a solicitude full of promise for the future, and I was able to examine him at my ease. Very fragile, my dear sir; he takes after his father, the poor baby, and I doubt that in spite of all your knowledge as a doctor you will be able to make him live: if by misfortune his death should occur, as is certainly to be feared, it will not harm your reputation: you give care, don't you, not life!
- Speaking of care," interrupted Saniel, who didn't want to answer, "have you done what I advised you to do?
- No, I haven't yet. The pharmacists in this district are notorious cut-throats; but this evening I'm going to see one of my clients, a pharmacist in Les Batignolles, who will treat me as a friend.
- I'll see you then.
- Whenever you like, my dear sir, when you've thought it over; now you have the password.
Before leaving home, Saniel had left his key with his concierge so that Philis wouldn't be waiting for him in the street if she came in his absence; when he returned, the concierge told him that 'madame' had already been upstairs long enough, and when he rang the bell, it was she who quickly opened the door.
- Well?" she asked in a trembling voice before he had even entered.
- What I told you yesterday: he hasn't found anyone.
She squeezed him in a long, passionate embrace.
- What about the upholsterer?
- He promised to save time.
As they spoke, they entered the study: the fire was burning in the fireplace, and it wasn't pieces of plank that were blazing, as the day before, but logs of hornbeam; on the table, lit by two candles, was a beautiful roast chicken, surrounded by watercress, and a bottle of red wine stood opposite the carafe of water.
He looked at her surprised.
- I've set the table," she said, "you see, I'm dining with you.
And throwing herself into his arms:
- Knowing Caffié better than you, I guessed his answer, and I didn't want you to be alone when you came back here: I've found another excuse not to have dinner with Mum.
- But what about the chicken?
- We needed a main course.
- This wood, these candles?
- That's the end of my savings; I would have been so happy if they had been less miserable and could have been used for something useful.
As on the previous evening, they sat down in front of the fire, and she immediately began to talk about various things to occupy and distract him: but what their lips did not say, their eyes, when they met, expressed with more intensity than words; nevertheless, until the end of dinner, they were both able to say nothing decisive.
It was he who, at one point, betrayed his preoccupation.
- Your brother had taken a good look at Caffié," he said, as if talking to himself.
- Didn't he?
- He's certainly the most perfect rascal I've ever met.
- I'm sure he's offered you some sort of infamy?
- He proposed marriage.
- I had a premonition of it.
- And that's why he refused me the loan I asked for. I had the simplicity to explain my situation to him frankly; at the same time, I told him how important it was for me to win the month of April, and he hopes that, under the weight of the lawsuits, when I see that I'm going to be put out on the street, I'll accept one of the two women he's offering me: with the knife to my throat, I'll have to give in; it's to keep him hanging on that he promised to delay the Jardine lawsuits and drag them out.
- And those women?" she asked, not daring to look him in the face.
- Don't worry, you have nothing to fear from them: one is a drunken butcher, the other is a young girl with a child.
- And these are the women he dares to propose to a man like you!
- His proposals are not as naked as I present them to you; they are cooked up in a sauce that, according to his feelings, should make them pass. If I don't cure the butcheress of her drunkenness, all I have to do is abandon her to her vice, which will take her in a short time, and, as the contract will be settled with this eventuality in mind, I will find myself the heir to her twenty thousand pounds of income. For the virgin with the child, the combination is different: this child has been endowed by his real father with two hundred thousand francs, and whoever legitimises him by marrying the mother will have the right to the income from these two hundred thousand francs until the child comes of age... if, however, he comes of age, because he is very fragile, so fragile even that, if his death were to occur, it would in no way harm my reputation as a doctor.
- You see what a monster he is!
- While he was explaining his schemes to me, offering me the death of others, I was thinking about his own, and telling myself that if he were killed, he would really only get what he deserved.
- That's the truth.
- For me, there was a time when nothing could have been easier. As he had a toothache, he showed me his jaw: all I had to do was strangle him; we were alone: a miserable diabetic like him who, I'm sure, doesn't have six months to live, wouldn't have resisted a grip like that. I took the keys out of his waistcoat, opened his cash register and took the thirty, forty, sixty thousand francs I saw piled up there. The devil if the law ever found out: a doctor doesn't strangle his clients, he poisons them, he kills them scientifically, not brutally.
- That's the trouble, it's that these ways of sorting things out are only available to people who have no conscience, and that they don't exist for us.
- I can assure you that it wasn't conscience that held me back.
- Fear of remorse, if I use the wrong word.
- But intelligent people have no remorse, my dear child, because with them reasoning precedes action and does not follow it: before acting, they weigh up the pros and cons, and know what the consequences of their actions will be for others as well as for themselves; if this preliminary examination proves to them that for whatever reason they can act, they will be at peace forever, assured of not being exposed to remorse, which is only the reproach of conscience.
- Undoubtedly, what you are saying is right, and yet it is impossible for me to accept it. Although I have not committed any crimes in my life, I have nevertheless done foolish things, even made mistakes, and some of them were deliberate, after the preliminary examination of which you speak: I should therefore have been perfectly at peace and sheltered from the reproaches of my conscience; nevertheless, the next morning I woke up unhappy, tormented, sometimes upset, without being able to stifle the mysterious voice that was accusing me.
- And in whose name was it speaking, this voice that was even more vague than mysterious?
- In the name of my conscience, obviously.
- Obviously' is too much, and you would be very embarrassed to show me the obvious, since nothing is more uncertain and elusive than what we call conscience, which is really just a matter of environment and upbringing.
- I don't understand.
- Does your conscience punish you for loving me?
- No, of course not.
- You see, then, that you have a personal way of understanding what is right and what is wrong that is not the one followed in our country, where it is accepted, both religiously and socially, that a young girl is guilty when she has a lover. Consequently, you can also see that conscience is a poor weighing instrument, since everyone uses weights of their own making to make it work.
- In any case, you did well not to strangle Caffié...
- You yourself, however, condemned him to death!
- By the hand of providential or human justice, but not by yours, any more than by Florentin's or mine, even though we know better than anyone that he deserves no mercy.
- You can see that I anticipated your objections, since I didn't tighten his tie.
- Fortunately.
- Is 'fortunately' the right word?
X
That evening Philis had to go home early, so dinner didn't go on as late as the previous evening; however, before leaving, she wanted to clear the table and put everything back in order.
- You'll be able to have your lunch tomorrow with the rest of the chicken," she said, shoving it into the larder, where it joined the tin of sardines and the terrine of foie gras.
And as he accompanied her, a torch in his hand to light her way, he could see that it wasn't just her lunch for the next day and the days to come that she had in mind: in the kitchen, a supply of wood occupied one corner; on a shelf were two packs of candles, and on the rabbits' chests was piled a supply of carrots sufficient to feed them and the guinea pigs for several days.
- What a brave little heart you have!
- Because I'm thinking about rabbits?
- For your tenderness and discretion.
- I wish I could be good for something!
When she had left him, he immediately sat down at his desk and started work, in a hurry to regain the time he had just given to sentiment. The fact that his work was to be for nothing, and that his experiments were to be abruptly interrupted the next day or a few days later, did not stop him: he had to work, and he worked as if he had the certainty of passing his competitions, and also the certainty that the experiments he had been carrying out for several years would be completed without anyone being able to disturb them.
In the street, he could think of Philis, be hungry, feel the weight of sleep; at his desk, there was no Philis, no hunger, no sleep, no worries, no memories, just his work, which took up all his time.
It was his strength and also his pride, the only superiority he could boast; for, although he recognised others, he never spoke of them, while he readily said to his comrades:
- Me, I work when I want and as long as I want; my will applied to work has never failed; what they say about Alexander the Great who, to stay awake at night, held a metal ball in his hand over a bronze basin, simply proves that the Macedonian was a softy.
That evening, for an hour, it was more or less as it always was: neither the bailiffs, nor Jardine, nor Caffié disturbed him; however, having had some research to do, he noticed that his memory did not obey him as usual: it hesitated, got confused, above all it had truly astonishing distractions.
He was definitely not in a normal state and his will was obeying instead of commanding.
There was a name and a phrase that he repeated to himself from time to time mechanically; the name was Caffié's; the phrase was "Nothing could be easier".
Why did this hypothesis of strangling Caffié, which he had only mentioned in passing and without attaching any importance to it at the time he had uttered it, come back to him like a sort of obsession?
Wasn't that strange?
Until now he had never thought he could strangle a man, no matter how rascal he was, and now, while chatting, he had come up with reasons that made the death of this rascal quite natural and even legitimate.
Hadn't Philis herself condemned him?
To be sure, she had added that Providence or Justice should carry out the execution, but that was the scruple of a naive conscience formed in an environment not influenced by him.
Did he have such scruples, the old businessman who, coldly, in the sole interest of a percent on a dowry, advised killing a woman through drunkenness, and a child anyhow?
With him, the game was really played by two and by the strongest of the two.
As he came to this conclusion, he paused, wondering if he was mad to follow such an idea; then immediately, to chase it away, he went back to work, which absorbed him for some time, though not as long as the first time.
Then, once again, his will escaping him, he began to think about Caffié again.
It was only too obvious that, if he had realised the idea of strangling Caffié, all the difficulties he was struggling against and which were going to crush him, if not the next day, at least in a few days' time, would have been immediately ironed out.
No more bailiffs, no more creditors! What a relief!
Rest, the possibility of taking his competitive exams with a calm mind that would not be troubled by the fever of material worries: under these conditions, his success was assured, he felt.
And his experiments! He no longer ran the risk of seeing them suddenly interrupted, his preparations were not thrown into the street, his culture tubes were not broken, his matras and balloons did not go to the junk shop; he continued his research, it led to the results he was after: for him, glory; for humanity, the cure of one of the most terrible diseases that mow it down, and perhaps of two!
So the question was quite simple:
On the one hand, Caffié;
On the other, humanity and science;
An old rascal, who had deserved to die twenty times over, and who was, moreover, going to die naturally in the near future;
And humanity and science, which would benefit from a discovery he had made.
He noticed that sweat was beading on his hands and trickling down his neck.
Why did he faint? Was it out of horror at the crime he was admitting was possible? Or out of fear of seeing his experiments destroyed?
He needed to think, to realise, to observe himself.
He had told Philis that intelligent people, before committing themselves to an action, weigh up the pros and cons.
He could see nothing against Caffié's death.
On the contrary, everything came together.
If he had had Philis' scruples or Brigard's beliefs, he would only have had to stop.
But, not having them, wouldn't he be naive to back down?
What would he back down from? Why would he stop?
Remorse? But he was convinced that intelligent people don't feel remorse when they've made up their minds with full knowledge of the facts: they feel remorse before they've made up their minds, not afterwards.
Fear of getting caught? But intelligent people don't get caught. The ones who get lost are either the brutes who go straight ahead, or the half-intelligent who put all their skill and finesse into combining a complicated or romantic action in which their hand is found. He was a man of science and precision, and he would compromise himself neither by the act nor by sentiment: nothing to fear during, nothing to fear after. If Caffié were strangled, suspicion would fall not on a doctor, but on a brute; when doctors want to kill someone, they do it skilfully, using poison or any other scientific method; brutes do it brutally; murder tells you the murderer's profession.
A few moments earlier, he had broken out in a cold sweat.
He rose nervously to his feet and began to walk jerkily around his study. The fire had been out for a long time already; outside the noise of the street had ceased, and in his brain resounded the word he was uttering: murderer!
Was he a man to let himself be influenced and stopped by a word? Where are the rich, the upwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile who have not left corpses behind them along the way? Success carries them along, and they were only successful because they had the strength.
Certainly violence was not a recreation, and it would be more pleasant to make one's way quietly, by the sheer power of intelligence and hard work, than to open it up with fists; but one does not choose this path, one is thrown into it by circumstances, by the fatalities of life, and whoever wants to reach the end has no choice of means; if one has to walk in the mud, what does it matter, when one knows that one will not soil oneself?
If Caffié had had heirs, poor people saved from poverty by this fortune on which they were counting, he would no doubt have allowed himself to be touched by this consideration: thief, the word was even nastier than that of murderer; but who would miss the few banknotes he took from this cash box? To steal is to wrong someone. Who would he harm? He couldn't see. But he could clearly see the army of afflicted people he would be helping.
A timid ring of the doorbell startled him, and he felt angry at feeling so nervous, he who was usually in control of his mind as well as his body.
He went to open the door: a man dressed as a workman greeted him humbly.
- I beg your pardon for disturbing you, doctor.
- What's on your mind?
- It's about my wife. I'll come and get you if you'd like to come.
- What about her?
- The midwife is no longer there; she wants a doctor.
- Did the midwife advise you to come and get me?
- No, doctor; she sent me to Mr Legrand.
- Did she?
- His wife told me that he couldn't get out of bed because of his bronchitis. So the pharmacist gave me your address.
- That's fine.
- I'm going to tell you, Mr Doctor, I'm an honest man; we're not rich, we won't be able to pay you... straight away.
- I'll be off. Wait for me.
Saniel picked up his tools and followed the workman, who explained to him what his wife was going through on the way.
- Where are we going?" asked Saniel, interrupting these explanations.
- Rue de la Corderie.
It was behind the marché Saint-Honoré, on the sixth floor, under the roofs, in a room that was clean despite its poverty. When Saniel entered, the midwife came to meet him, and stopping him, she said in a low voice, sententiously:
- This is a case of dystocia due to a malformation of the pelvis.
- Is the child alive?
- Yes, it's alive.
- All right, we'll see.
He approached the bed and took a long look at the patient, who kept repeating:
- I'm going to die! Save me, doctor.
- We'll certainly save you," he said softly, "I promise.
He stood up and took off his frock coat, then his waistcoat.
- Give me an apron," he said to the midwife, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt.
She brought him the apron and, as he tied it under his arms :
- Well?" she asked.
- All we have to do is kill the child to save the mother; we've waited too long.
- You're going to perform an embryotomy!
- I'm not going to bother.
The operation was long, difficult and painful, and after it was over, Saniel stayed with the patient for a long time; when he went down to the street, five o'clock was striking on a clock, and the market square was already buzzing with activity.
But in the streets, returning to the silence and solitude of the night, he began to reflect: he had not hesitated to kill this child, who had perhaps sixty or eighty years of happy life ahead of him, and he stopped at the death of Caffié, who had only a miserable existence of a few days. The interests of a poor, debilitated, stunted woman had made up his mind; his own interests and those of humanity left him perplexed, irresolute, weak and a coward. What a contradiction!
He was walking with his eyes downcast; just then, on the pavement in front of him, he saw an object shining under the flickering gas; he approached it. It was a butcher's knife, which a boy going to the abattoir or coming to the market had lost.
He hesitated for a moment whether to pick it up or leave it there: then, looking around and seeing no one in the deserted street, hearing no sound of footsteps in the silence, he bent down quickly and picked it up.
Caffié's fate was decided.
XI
When, after two hours' sleep, Saniel awoke, he did not at first think of the knife: he was weary and his confused thoughts remained numb; he moved about the room mechanically, without realising what he was doing, as if he were sleepwalking; and this surprised him, for he never felt tired in mind or body, no matter how little he slept.
But all of a sudden, when his eyes met the knife that he had placed on the marble mantelpiece on his way home, he felt a shock that shook off his numbness and fatigue: it was like a bolt of lightning that dazzled him.
He picked it up and, approaching the window, examined it in the pale light of the new day; it was a solid instrument which, in a firm hand, would be a terrible weapon: newly sharpened, it had the edge of a razor.
Then the idea, the vision he had had two hours before, came back to him clear and complete as it had been: At dusk, in other words when the concierge was in the second block of the building, he would go up to Caffié's, without being seen, and, with this knife, he would cut his throat; it was as simple as it was easy, and this knife left next to the corpse, as well as the nature of the wound, told the police that they should look for a butcher or, at least, a man used to using a knife of this kind. 
When he had discussed Caffié's death the day before, both the time and the manner of the execution had remained vague; but now the day and the means had been specified: it would be with this knife and this very evening.
This shook him out of his torpor and sent a shiver down his spine.
But he was angry at this weakness: did he or did he not know what he wanted? Irresolute or cowardly?
Then, jumping from one idea to another, he thought of an observation he had made which seemed to prove that in many subjects there was less firmness in the morning than in the evening. Was this a result of the dualism of the nervous centres, and was the human personality as dual as the brain? Were there hours when the right hemisphere was the master of our wills; were there others when it was the left; did one of these hemispheres possess special qualities that the other did not, and according to whether it was this one or that one that came into activity, did we have this character or that temperament? That would be curious and would be like saying that you can be a sheep in the morning and a tiger in the evening. In his case, it was a sheep that woke up and a tiger that devoured it during the day. To which hemisphere did either of these personalities belong?
It was Caffié he had to deal with and the plan which, in the street, before he had decided to pick up the knife, had instantly taken shape in his mind.
Obviously, things were neither as simple nor as easy as he had first seen them, and for his plan to succeed, a whole series of circumstances would have to come together, which might very well not.
Would the concierge not see him pass? Would anyone go up or down the stairs? Would he be alone? Would he open the door? Wouldn't the doorbell ring when they were locked in together?
There was a whole series of questions which had not at first presented themselves to his mind, but which now imposed themselves.
He had to examine them, weigh them up, and not throw himself headlong into an adventure that could present such hazards.
Fortunately, he had the whole day to himself and, since in his agitated state there was no time to think about work, he would give it over to this examination: the stakes were worth it: his honour and his life.
As soon as he was dressed, he went out and headed straight ahead through the streets whose pavements were already clogged with the morning's hustle and bustle.
It was only when he had left the centre of Paris that he could think as he wished, that is, without being disturbed at every moment by people in a hurry whom he had to avoid or by newspaper readers who, not looking ahead, pounced on him.
Obviously the risks were more serious than he had imagined, and as he saw them taking shape, he wondered whether he should go any further. Removing Caffié was fine; getting caught was not.
Then he was surprised to find that he felt no disappointment; on the contrary, a sort of appeasement was building up inside him.
- If it's impossible...
He wasn't the sort of man to go madly after the impossible: he would have had a dream... a bad dream, and that would have been that.
He stopped and, after a moment's hesitation, turned on his heels and turned back: what was the point of going any further? He didn't have to think about it any more, or weigh up the pros and cons; he had to abandon this plan, which was decidedly too dangerous.
But he had hardly taken a few steps to get back to his house when he wondered whether the dangers were really as he had just glimpsed them, and whether he was really faced with a radically demonstrated impossibility.
Without doubt, the concierge might notice him when he passed her dressing room, either on his way up or on his way down; but she might also not notice him at all: that, in reality, depended a great deal on him, and on the way he proceeded.
Every evening, this old caretaker with ankylosis in her back had to turn on the gas in two buildings, the one on the street and the one in the courtyard. She started with the one on the street and, with the discomfort she felt walking, it took her a long time to climb up the five flights of stairs and back down again. Let them watch from the street for the moment when, at dusk, she came out of her dressing room, her rat-de-cave lit in her hand; let them immediately climb the stairs behind her, but a little way behind and without joining her, so as to be on the landing of the first floor when she herself arrived on that of the second, and they would have plenty of time, the matter done, to get back to the street before she returned to her dressing room after lighting the gas on her two staircases. It was a question of proceeding regularly, methodically, without hurrying, but also without lingering.
Was this impossible?
This was precisely the delicate point, the one that had to be examined with composure, without allowing himself to be influenced by any consideration other than that which derived from the fact itself.
He had therefore been wrong not to continue on his way, and the best thing was surely to get out of Paris: in the countryside, in the fields or woods, he would find the calm that was indispensable to his overexcited brain, in which ideas were crashing like the waves of a stormy sea.
At the moment he was in the middle of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré: he took a street that would lead him to the Champs-Élysées, which at this early hour were deserted.
For a long time he considered all the possibilities that might arise, and he came to the conviction that what had seemed impossible to him was in no way so: if he kept calm, if he did not lose track of the time that had passed, he could very well escape from the concierge, -- which was the most important point.
In truth, once the danger of the concierge had been averted, all was not said; there remained the danger of being met on the staircase by one of the tenants of the house; there also remained the bad luck of not finding Caffié at home, or that he was not alone, or that a ringing bell stopped his hand at the decisive moment; but, by the very fact that they depended solely on chance, these circumstances could not be decided in advance: If one of them came true, he would have to wait until the next day, which would be another day of agitation. 
But one question that had to be decided in advance, because it was bound to present itself with serious dangers, was how he would justify the arrival in his hands of a sum of money which, providentially and at the right moment, would relieve him of the embarrassments he was struggling with: "You've paid your debts, that's perfect; with what? You were destitute, desperate, drowning; where did you find the money that miraculously saved you?
He had reached the Bois de Boulogne; he continued on ahead; but as he passed a fountain, the splashing of which attracted his attention, he stopped: although the weather was damp and cold under the influence of a strong west wind laden with rain, his tongue was parched: he drank two goblets of water, then resumed his walk, without worrying about where it would take him.
He came up with a scheme that seemed ingenious at the time: he had gone to Caffié's to borrow three thousand francs; why shouldn't Caffié have lent them to him, if not on the first day, at least on the second? It would have been with this loan that he would have paid his debts, if he were ever questioned on this point; to prove this loan, all he had to do was sign a note which he would place in the cash register and which would be found there. Isn't the first duty of anyone who has signed an undertaking of this kind to take it back when the opportunity arises? If he didn't seize the opportunity and make the note disappear, that would be proof that he hadn't opened the box.
Among other advantages, this arrangement eliminated theft: it was now just a loan; later he would return the three thousand francs to Caffié's heirs; too bad for Caffié if it was a forced loan!
On his way back to Paris, he would buy a sheet of stamped paper, and as he had paid for a visit the day before, this expenditure was possible.
On arriving at Saint-Cloud, he went into a cabaret and had a piece of bread served with cheese and wine; but although he drank a lot, he could only eat a little, as his tight throat refused to swallow the bread.
He resumed his route and took to the clay paths that run along the slopes of Mont Valérien; but he was impervious to the discomfort and fatigue of slipping on soggy ground, and he always went at random, having no other concern than not to stray too far from the Seine, so as to be able to return to Paris before nightfall.
Ever since he'd come up with the ticket, he'd enjoyed it; but after examining it and turning it over, he realised that it wasn't as ingenious as he'd thought, and that it could even be his undoing. Don't stamp-paper dealers often number their paper? With this number, it would be possible to trace the sale of the sheet on which the note was written back to the person who had bought it. And then, was it likely that a meticulous businessman like Caffié would not write down the loans he granted in a notebook or a book, and would the absence of this entry, when a note was found, not be enough of a clue to arouse suspicion and lead people to it?
Decidedly, he was escaping one danger only to fall into another: there were pitfalls everywhere.
He was discouraged, but not to the point of giving up. His mistake had been to imagine that carrying out the idea that had occurred to him when he picked up the knife was as simple as it was easy: but, complicated and perilous as it was, it was not impossible: who doesn't have his dangers?
Ultimately, the question was whether he had the strength within him to face up to these dangers, and there was no room for hesitation on this point: wanting to foresee everything in advance was madness; what he hadn't thought of would happen.
He returned to Paris and, via the Suresnes bridge, entered the Bois de Boulogne; as it was not yet three o'clock, he had plenty of time to reach the Rue Sainte-Anne before dark; but, on the way, a shower forced him to take shelter under a mushroom tree: and he stayed there for quite a long time watching the rain fall, wondering if this chance he hadn't foreseen was going to disrupt his plan, at least for this very evening: a man who had received this downpour couldn't walk down the street in front of Caffié's door without attracting the attention of passers-by, and the important thing was that he didn't attract anyone's attention. 
At last the rain stopped, and at four forty he arrived home: he had fifteen or twenty minutes of daylight left, which was more than he needed.
He stuck the tip of the knife into a cork and, having placed it between the folded leaves of a newspaper in the inside pocket of the left side of his frock coat, he left.
XII
When he arrived at Caffié's door, it was not yet completely dark, and although the gas in the shops was already blazing, the gas in the street lanterns had not yet been lit.
The best and safest thing for him to do would have been to park in front of the carriage entrance on the opposite side; from there he could watch out for the concierge, who could not have left her lodge without him seeing her. But even though there weren't many passers-by at the time, they might have noticed him: just opposite the carriage entrance was a small café, whose gas-bright front would have put him in too much light. So he continued on his way, but slowly and almost immediately retraced his steps.
All irresolution and hesitation had disappeared, and the only point on which he still wondered was the state in which he found himself at that very moment: he felt firm, and his pulse, he was sure, was beating regularly: he was as he had imagined he would be; experience confirmed his predictions: his hand would not tremble any more than his will.
As he passed in front of the house again, he saw the concierge slowly leave her dressing room and carefully lock her door, putting the key in her pocket; in her left hand she was holding something whitish that in the darkness he could hardly make out, but which must have been a rat-de-cave, which she had not lit for fear, no doubt, that the wind rushing through the arch of the carriage entrance would extinguish it.
This was a favourable circumstance which gave him one or two minutes more than he had counted on, since on the stairs she would be obliged to strike matches to light her rat-de-cave; and, in the execution of his plan, two minutes, even one minute, could be of decisive importance.
With shuffling steps and a hunched back, she disappeared through the staircase vestibule; he then continued on his way as a mere passer-by, so that she would have time to ascend to the first floor; then, turning on himself, he came back to the porte-cochère and passed through it briskly: In the light of the gas burner in the vestibule, he saw on his watch, which he was holding in his hand, that it was fourteen minutes past five; if his calculations were correct, he would have to pass the dressing room at twenty-four or twenty-five minutes past five, which must have been empty at the time. 
Above him he heard the heavy footsteps of the concierge on the staircase; she had just lit the first-floor burner and was continuing her ascent slowly. With quick but light steps, he climbed up behind her and, on reaching Caffié's door, he rang the bell, taking care that it was neither too rudely nor too timidly; then he knocked with equally spaced knocks, as he had been instructed.
Was Caffié alone?
Up to this point, everything had gone smoothly: no one in the hallway, no one on the stairs; luck was on his side; would it accompany him to the end?
While he waited at the door, asking himself this question, an idea crossed his mind: he would make one last attempt; if Caffié agreed to the loan, he would save himself; if he refused, he would condemn himself.
After a few seconds, which seemed as long as hours, his alert ear picked up noises which announced that Caffié was at home: a scrape of wood on the floor said that a seat had been pushed back; heavy footsteps trailed, then the bolt creaked and the door opened cautiously.
- Ah! it's you, my dear sir!" said Caffié in surprise.
Saniel had entered quickly and had closed the door himself, pressing it firmly.
- Have we got any news?" asked Caffié, passing from the entrance into his study.
- No," replied Saniel.
- Well, then?" asked Caffié, taking a seat in his armchair in front of his desk, which was lit by a lamp. "So you've come for my young person; this eagerness is a good omen.
- No, it's not about this young person that I want to talk to you...
- I'm sorry.
Saniel had pulled out his watch as he sat down opposite Caffié; two minutes had passed since he had left the vestibule; he had to hurry... For fear of not realising how much time had passed, he kept his watch in his hand.
- Are you in a hurry?
- Yes, and I'll come straight to the point: it's about me, my position, and I want to make a final appeal to you. We have to put our cards on the table. You think, no doubt, that driven by my distress and seeing that I am going to be lost forever, I will decide to accept this marriage that would save me?
- Can you imagine that, my dear sir?" exclaimed Caffié.
But Saniel stopped him:
- The calculation is too natural for you not to have made it. Well, I have to tell you that it's wrong: I would never lend myself to such a deal. I absolutely need these three thousand francs, and I'll pay whatever price you decide.
- I couldn't find a landlord, my dear sir; I was very sorry about that, I can assure you; but what do you want?
- That you make an effort yourself.
- Me! My dear sir?
- I'm talking to you.
- But I don't have any cash!
- I'm making a desperate appeal. I understand that long experience of business has made you insensitive to the misery you see every day...
- Insensitive! Please tell me that they are heartbreaking, my dear sir.
- ... But won't you let yourself be touched by the plight of a young, intelligent, courageous man, who is going to drown for want of a hand stretched out to him? For you, this help that I am asking you for so insistently is nothing...
- Three thousand francs is nothing! My, how you go on!
- For me, if you refuse, it's death.
Saniel had begun speaking with his eyes fixed on the hands of his watch, but soon, carried away by the fever of the situation, he had raised them to look at Caffié and see the effect he was having on him.
Caffié's study was a room longer than it was wide, with a high window overlooking the courtyard; having only been in the study at night, he had not noticed that the window was not closed with shutters or curtains, either muslin or drapery: the glazing was quite simple. In truth, two large woollen damask curtains hung on either side of the window, but they were not drawn. Talking to Caffié, who was standing between him and the window, Saniel had suddenly realised that on the other side of the courtyard, in the second part of the building, on the second floor, there were two lighted windows facing the study, and that from there you could dive into the study and see everything that was going on. How could he carry out his plan in front of the people he saw coming and going in this room? It would surely mean getting lost. In any case, he was risking an adventure so risky that he would have had to be mad to attempt it, and he was not mad; he had never even felt so in control of his mind and his nerves.
So it was no longer to save Caffié's life that he was pleading, it was to save himself by snatching this loan.
- With great regret, I can only repeat what I have already told you, my dear sir: no cash!
And he clutched his jaw, whimpering as if this refusal was reviving his toothache.
Saniel had got up: obviously all he had to do was leave: it was over and, instead of despairing, he felt a kind of relief.
But as he was about to head for the entrance, a flash of lightning struck him.
He looked quickly at his watch, which he had not consulted for some time; it read twenty past five: he therefore had four minutes left, five at the most.
- Why don't you close those big curtains?" he said; "I'm sure that a lot of your pain is caused by the wind blowing in through that badly closed window.
- Do you think so?
- I'm sure of it; you need warmth for your head and you must avoid draughts.
Passing behind Caffié's back, he went to the window to draw the curtains, but the cords resisted.
- It's been years since they were closed," said Caffié; "no doubt the cords are tangled. I'll give you some light.
And, taking the lamp, he came to the window, holding it high to illuminate the cords.
In the twinkling of an eye, Saniel had untangled the cords, and the curtains he drew slid back on their rods, just about closing the window.
- It's true that there was a lot of wind coming through this window," said Caffié; "thank you, my dear doctor.
All this had been done with a feverish rapidity that astonished Caffié.
- You're definitely in a hurry? he said.
- Yes, I'm in a great hurry.
He looked at his watch.
- But I still have time to give you a consultation if you wish.
- I wouldn't want to take advantage...
- You're not taking advantage.
- Yes, I am!
Sit down in your armchair and show me your mouth.
While Caffié sat down, Saniel continued in a vibrant voice:
- You see, I do good for evil.
- What do you mean, my dear sir?
- You refuse me a service that could have saved my life, and I give you a consultation; it's true that it's the last one.
- And why the last, my dear sir?
- Because death is between us.
- Death!
- Can't you see it?
- No, I can't.
- I see it.
- You mustn't have such ideas, my dear sir; you don't die because you can't pay three thousand francs.
The armchair in which Caffié had taken his seat was an old voltaire with a sloping back, and he was standing in it upside down: as he was wearing shirt collars that were too wide since he lost weight, and narrow ties that were barely knotted, he was stretching his throat as much as his jaw.
Saniel, behind the armchair, had drawn the knife with his right hand, while with his left he pressed firmly on Caffié's forehead, and with one powerful stroke, as quick as lightning, he had cut the larynx below the glottis, as well as the two carotid arteries with the jugular veins; From this terrible wound, a large jet of blood had escaped and crashed through the cabinet against the front door; not a cry had been able to escape from the trachea, which had been cut clean through, and in his armchair Caffié was shaken by general convulsions that shook his whole body, legs and arms. 
Coming out from behind the armchair, Saniel, who had thrown the knife on the floor, was watching him with his watch in his hand, counting the beats of the seconds hand and writing them down half aloud: one, two, three...
At ninety, the convulsions stopped. It was twenty-three minutes past five: now it was important to hurry and not waste a second.
The blood, having gushed out in a thick stream, had run down the body and wetted the pocket of the waistcoat in which the key to the cash register must have been; but blood does not have the same effect on a doctor or a butcher as it does on those who are not used to the sight, smell and feel of it: Despite the tepid pool in which it bathed, Saniel took the key, and after wiping his hand on one of the flaps of Caffié's frock coat, he inserted it in the lock. 
Would the bolt work freely, or was the mechanism locked by a combination? It was a poignant question... The key turned and the door opened. On a shelf and in a begging bowl were the bundles of banknotes and rolls of gold that he had seen the evening the cashier had come to collect a draft: suddenly, without counting, at random, he stuffed them into his pockets and, without closing the till, he ran to the front door, taking care not to step in the trickles of blood that had run down the sloping pavement towards this door. The clock was ticking.
Now was the moment of greatest danger, the moment of an encounter behind this door or on the stairs: he listened, no noise; he went out: nobody. Without running, but hurrying, he descended the stairs. Would he look into the dressing room or turn his head away? He looked and did not see the concierge.
A second later he was in the street, mingling with the passers-by, breathing.
XIII
He no longer had to observe himself, to listen, to tense his nerves, to hold back his heart; he could walk freely and think.
His first thought was to try and realise what he was feeling, and he found that it was an immense relief, something analogous no doubt to the state of the asphyxiated person who comes back to life: physically, he had regained his composure; morally, he felt no turmoil, no remorse: he had therefore not been mistaken in his theory when he had explained to Philis that in the intelligent man remorse precedes action and does not follow it.
But where he had gone wrong was in imagining that he would bring to his act a composure and strength that in reality he had completely lacked.
Moving from one idea to another, tossed about by irresolution, he had in no way been the strong man he had believed himself to be: the man who marches towards his goal without being moved, ready to face any attack from wherever it comes, master of his nerves as well as his will, in full possession of all his means. On the contrary, he had been the victim of agitation and weakness. If a serious danger had stood in his way, he would not have known which way to approach it, fear would have paralysed him and he would undoubtedly have lost himself.
In truth, his hand had been firm, but his head had been panic-stricken.
There was something humiliating about this that he had to admit to himself and, what was more serious, something worrying; for, because everything had worked out so well up to now, it was not all over and nothing had even begun.
If the investigations that the law was going to undertake reached him, how would he defend himself?
He thought he was quite sure that he had not been seen in Caffié's house at the time the crime was committed; but can you ever tell whether you have been seen or not?
Similarly, the source of the money he was going to use to pay his debts could become an accusation against which it would be difficult for him to defend himself. "You were destitute yesterday, in dire straits; how, from one day to the next, did you procure the considerable sums for yourself, with which you paid off your creditors?" -- He had heard this question and could not find an answer to it any more now than when he had first considered it; and it was no longer for an indeterminate day that it had to be resolved, it was for tomorrow; in any case, he had to be ready as if it had certainly been for the following day. And what could complicate matters was the fact that Caffié, being the cautious man that he was, had taken care to note down the numbers of his banknotes in a book that could be found.
On leaving the rue Sainte-Anne he had taken the rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs to go home to deposit his banknotes, to remove the bloodstains that must have splattered him and to wash his hands, especially his right hand, which was still red; but suddenly the idea crossed his mind that he could be followed and that it would be foolish to say where he lived. So, quickening his pace enough to force whoever was following him to run, he set off ahead of him, having no other concern than to take the poorly lit streets where there was little chance of anyone seeing the stains, if they showed on his clothes, his linen or his socks. He walked like this for about half an hour, turning and turning on his trail, blurring it, and after crossing the Place Vendôme twice, where he could see far behind him, he had decided to return, not knowing whether to be satisfied at having diverted the search in this way or whether to be angry at having given in to a kind of panic.
As he passed the lodge without stopping, his concierge called to him and, coming out at once, handed him a letter with unusual alacrity; Saniel, who wanted to avoid any examination, took it quickly and stuffed it in his pocket.
- It's an important letter," said the concierge; "the servant who gave it to me told me it contained money.
It needed this recommendation for Saniel to think of opening it at such a moment, which he did on entering his house.
"My dear doctor, I don't want to leave Paris for Monaco, where I'll be spending two or three months, without thanking you.
"Yours sincerely
" C. DUPHOT.
These thanks were represented by two hundred-franc notes, more than sufficient payment for the care Saniel had given, a few months previously, to the mistress of this former comrade. He threw them on his desk and immediately, after lighting two candles, inspected his clothes and linen.
Only the hand holding the knife and the cuff of the shirt had been splashed, but that was of no consequence: a doctor has every right to have blood on his sleeves, and this shirt would join the one with which he had rescued the woman in the Rue de la Corderie the previous night.
He emptied them onto his desk, where he counted everything: five rolls of gold worth a thousand francs and three bundles of ten thousand francs each in bank notes.
How could he get rid of this considerable sum immediately, and how could he later justify its provenance when the time came... if it came?
The question was complex and, unfortunately for him, he was in no position to examine it coldly.
As for the gold, all he had to do was burn the papers on the rolls straight away; the louis had no numbers or particular marks, but the notes did: where could he hide them until he found out from the newspapers whether Caffié had or had not noted down the numbers?
While burning the papers on which Caffié had written "1000 francs" in his own handwriting, he looked for the hiding place he needed: behind a mirror, under the mantelpiece which he would lift, under a sheet of parquet flooring, in his books: but all these means did not seem secure enough to him to ensure that, in a properly conducted search, the hiding place would not be discovered, which would be his undoing.
As he looked around him, asking things for an inspiration that his brain did not provide, they came across the letter he had just received, and it was this letter that suggested something less banal: Duphot was in Monaco to play; why shouldn't he go too and not play?
Since he had neither relatives nor friends from whom he could obtain a certain sum, his only resource was to gamble for it, and in the desperate position he was in, in full view of everyone, nothing was more natural than this attempt: he had just received two hundred francs which could not save him from his creditors; he was risking them at the roulette wheel in Monaco. It didn't matter whether he won or lost; he would have played. That was enough. He would have been seen gambling. Who would know if he had won or lost? He would say he had won; no one would contradict him. From Monaco, he would have Jardine pay him by telegraphic order, out of the five thousand francs in gold, which would be more than enough for that; and, when he returned to Paris, he would get rid of his other creditors with what he had left.
The matter of the provenance had been settled, and it seemed to him that it had been settled intelligently, but the matter of the banknotes which, spread out before his eyes, were in the way had not been resolved. What should he do with them? It would really have been wiser for him not to take them from the cash register. No matter how light those three bundles were, they crushed him, and under their weight he felt paralysed. For a moment, he thought of lighting a fire and throwing them in. But reflection held him back: wouldn't it be madness to wipe out this fortune; in any case, wouldn't it be the mark of a narrow-minded person with few resources? He had to look; he had to find; and if he looked hard enough, a way would certainly present itself.
He searched and searched, but no matter how deeply absorbed he wished to be, he could not banish a thought that was imposing itself on his mind: What was happening now, in the Rue Sainte-Anne? Had death been discovered?
That was where he should have been to see, instead of politely shutting himself up in the study where he was devouring himself.
For a few moments, he tried to resist this obsession, but it was stronger than his will and his reasoning: as long as he was under its influence, he would find nothing.
Whether he liked it or not, whether it made sense or not, he had to go.
He washed his hands, changed his shirt and, after throwing the notes and the gold in a drawer, he left.
He realised very well that there was a certain danger in leaving the evidence of the crime at his place, which, if found in a search, would overwhelm him without his being able to defend himself; but he told himself that this immediate search was improbable and that, if he did not include the probable and the improbable in his calculations, it would be better for him not to reason: it was a chance he was running, but how many good chances did he not have on his side!
He had walked along the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs in a hurry, but as he approached the Rue Sainte-Anne, he slowed his pace, looking ahead, looking around, listening: nothing unusual struck him; similarly, when he turned into the Rue Sainte-Anne, he found it to be his usual self: few passers-by, no curious onlookers, no groups on the pavements, no shopkeepers on their doorsteps; nothing but what he saw every day.
No doubt nothing had been discovered yet. He had already passed Caffié's door too many times, and when you were built like he was, with an above-average height and a look and bearing that were not those of everyone else, you had to avoid attracting attention.
For a few minutes he strolled slowly back and forth from the rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs to the rue du Hasard; from there he could see all the way to Caffié's house, but he was far enough away from it that no one would think he was standing guard in front of it.
It seemed to him that someone was watching him, and when two passers-by stopped to chat, he wondered if it wasn't him: why didn't they continue on their way? Why did they occasionally turn their heads his way? He was even more worried about the clerks who were returning a display to their shop: they were in no hurry to finish their work and, every time they returned to the pavement, they followed him with their curious glances; later, they could be dangerous witnesses.
He left the square and, as he couldn't bring himself to leave "the house", he found it ingenious to go and take a seat in the little café opposite.
As he entered, he sat down by the door at a table leaning against the shop window, which he thought would be an excellent vantage point from which to watch the street.
- Shall we serve the gentleman?" asked the waiter.
- Coffee.
He made this reply mechanically, without knowing what he was saying, and only thought about it after he had let it go, wondering if it was natural to have coffee at this hour: the people seated in the room were drinking aperitifs or beer; wasn't it a clumsiness?
But everything seemed clumsy to him, just as everything seemed dangerous; couldn't he regain his composure and his sanity? He drank his coffee slowly, in small gulps; then he had a newspaper given to him, to gain composure. The street was still quiet, and people came out of the café one after the other; dinner was served for the café staff at a table at the back.
And he, behind his newspaper, was thinking: it was his feverish curiosity that had made him assume that Caffié's death would be discovered that evening; in reality, it could very well not be discovered until the next day: there were as many reasons for one hypothesis as for the other, and he could not stay in that café until the next day, or even until midnight; perhaps he had already been there too long.
However, he didn't want to leave yet, and as he couldn't, he thought, read indefinitely, he asked what he needed to write and paid the waiter, so that he could get out as quickly as possible if anything happened.
What to write? Just writing on paper. He wanted to force himself to put in order a piece of work that was ready but for which he had run out of time: it would be a test that would tell him what he was capable of. Strangely enough, while writing he was able to follow his ideas and find the right word, but when he reread, his will escaped him: he was in the street.
Suddenly, there was a movement under the carriage entrance of "the house", and a man ran across the street; three or four people stopped and grouped together.
- He got out without hurrying too much and, in a voice that he strengthened, he asked what was going on.
- A business agent has been murdered in his home: the police have been sent to the office in the Rue du Hasard.
XIV
Saniel had come there to see and know, without having decided, during his long wait, what he should do. Instantly, with a decisiveness he had so often lacked since the day before, he resolved to go up to Caffié's house with the police: wasn't he a doctor, and, what's more, the victim's doctor?
- A businessman!" he said; "is that Mr Caffié?
- Precisely.
- But I'm his doctor!
- A doctor! Here's a doctor!
They moved aside and Saniel entered the carriage entrance, where the concierge, half fainting, was sitting on a chair, surrounded by all the maids of the house and a few neighbours to whom she was telling the story.
Elbowing his way over, he managed to approach her.
- Who said Mr Caffié was dead?" he asked authoritatively.
- Nobody said he was dead; not me at least.
- Well, did he?
- Well, there's a spot of blood that's dripped from his study onto the landing, even though it looks like a cat's waste, without resembling it, and since he's at home, since from the courtyard you can faintly see the light from his lamp, which he never lets burn when he goes to dinner... we think there's something wrong; and then why are his curtains closed? He always left them open.
At that moment, two sergeants entered the door, preceded by a locksmith armed with a bunch of hooks, and a small man with glasses, a fine, smart face, wearing a mechanical hat with curling blond hair - probably the police commissioner.
- Which floor?" he asked the concierge.
- On the first floor.
- Come with us.
He started up the stairs, accompanied by the concierge, the locksmith and an officer; Saniel wanted to follow them, but the second officer blocked his way.
- Excuse me, Superintendent," said Saniel.
- What do you want, sir?
- I'm Mr Caffié's doctor.
- Sir?
- Doctor Saniel.
- Let the doctor through," said the superintendent, "but alone; get everyone out and close the carriage entrance!
As he reached the landing, the superintendent stopped to look at the brown stain that had run under the door and spread over the floor, as Caffié had never had a doormat.
- It's a bloodstain," said Saniel, who had bent down to examine it and dipped his finger in it.
- Open the door," ordered the superintendent to the locksmith; "it should only be locked at half a turn.
The locksmith examined the entrance, looked through his hooks, chose one and on the first try the door opened.
- Don't let anyone in! said the superintendent. Doctor, please follow me.
And, going through the first door, he entered the first study, that of the clerk, followed by Saniel. Two small rivulets of blood, already thickened, starting from Caffié's armchair and running down the slope of the window that sloped towards the staircase, had joined together to form the stain that had uncovered the crime; the superintendent and Saniel were careful not to step in it.
- The unfortunate man had his neck cut," said Saniel. He's been dead for two or three hours; there's nothing we can do.
- For you, Doctor, but not for me.
And, bending down, he picked up the knife from the armchair.
- Isn't that a butcher's knife?" asked Saniel, who had come here only to throw out the word.
- It looks like one.
He had lifted Caffié's head and was examining the wound:
- You can see," he said, "that the victim's throat has been slit; the blow was struck from left to right by a steady hand that must have been used to wielding this knife; but it wasn't just a strong, practised hand that killed, it was also an intelligence that knew how to proceed so that death was swift, almost lightning-quick and at the same time silent.
- You think it was a butcher?
- A professional killer: the larynx has been cut below the glottis, and at the same time the two carotid arteries with the jugular veins. As the killer had to raise his head, the victim was unable to utter a single scream; there was a considerable flow of blood, and death must have occurred in one or two minutes.
- The scene seems to me to have been very well reconstructed," said the superintendent.
- The blood must have gushed out in this direction," continued Saniel, pointing to the entrance; but as the door to this entrance was open, nothing was seen.
While Saniel was speaking, the superintendent cast a circular gaze around him, the gaze of the policeman who sees everything and picks it all up.
- The cash register is open," he said; "the case is clear: murder followed by robbery.
There was a door opposite the entrance, and the superintendent opened it: it was the door to Caffié's bedroom.
- I'm going to give you a man to help you carry the body to this room, where you can continue your examination more easily, while I'll also be able to carry out my investigations more easily in this study.
Saniel would have liked to stay in the study to witness these investigations, but it was impossible to raise any objection. The armchair was rolled into the bedroom, where the candles in the fireplace had been lit, and when the corpse had been laid on the bed, the commissioner returned to the study.
Saniel made his examination last as long as he could, so as not to leave the house, but he could not prolong it beyond certain limits; when they were reached, he returned to the clerk's chambers, where the superintendent had taken his seat and was receiving the concierge's statement.
- So," he said, "from five to seven o'clock, nobody asked you for Mr Caffié?
- Nobody; but I left my dressing room at a quarter past five to turn on the gas for my stairs; it took me a good twenty minutes, because I'm no longer flexible, and during that time they were able to go up and down the stairs without me seeing anyone passing in front of the dressing room.
- Well," the superintendent asked Saniel, "did you find anything characteristic?
- No; there's no wound other than the one on the neck.
- Would you like to write your forensic report while I continue my investigation?
- Of course.
And, without waiting, he sat down at the clerk's desk, facing the secretary of the Commissaire, who had arrived a few moments earlier.
- I'm going to swear you in," said the commissioner.
When this formality had been completed, Saniel began his report:
"We, the undersigned, Victor Saniel, Doctor of Medicine of the Faculty of Paris, residing in Paris, rue Louis-le-Grand, having taken an oath to fulfil in honour and conscience the mission entrusted to us..."
As he wrote, he paid close attention to what was being said around him and did not miss a word of the concierge's statement.
- I'm certain," she said, "that from half past five to the present time, only people from the house passed through the staircase.
- But before half past five?
- I told you that, from a quarter past five to half past five, I was not in my dressing room.
- And before a quarter past five?
- Many people I don't know passed by.
- Did any of these people ask for Monsieur Caffié?
- No; that is, yes. There was someone who asked me if M. Caffié was at home; but I know him well; that's why I said no. And who was this someone?
- And who was this someone?
- A former clerk of M. Caffié.
- What's his name?
- Mr Florentin... Mr Florentin Cormier.
Saniel's hand stopped, but he had the strength not to raise his head.
- What time did he come?" asked the superintendent.
- Around three o'clock, more before than after.
- Did you see him leave?
- Of course; he even spoke to me.
- What time was it?
- Half past three.
- Do you think death could have happened at that time?" asked the commissaire, addressing Saniel.
- No; I think it was between five and six o'clock.
- The superintendent must not suspect M. Florentin," cried the concierge; "he's a good young man, incapable of harming a flea. And then, there's a good reason why the death didn't happen at three or three-thirty: M. Caffié's lamp was on, and you know, the poor man, he wasn't a man to light his lamp in broad daylight; looking as he did... as it should be.
Suddenly, she stopped and punched herself in the forehead.
- It's all coming back to me and you'll see that Mr Florentin had nothing to do with it. As I was going up the stairs at a quarter past five to light my gas, someone came up behind me and rang Mr Caffié's doorbell, knocking three or four times, which was the signal for the door to be opened.
Saniel's pen stopped again, and he had to rest his hand on the table to stop it shaking.
- Who was this someone?
Saniel didn't have the strength not to look at the concierge.
- I don't know," she replied; "I didn't see it, but I heard it, a man's step. It was the rascal who did it, you can be sure of that.
It was indeed likely.
- He left while I was on the other staircase; he knew the habits of the house well.
Saniel had resumed writing his report.
After turning the concierge round and round without being able to get any more out of her, the superintendent dismissed her, and leaving Saniel to his task, he went into Caffié's study, where he stayed for quite a long time.
When he returned, he had brought a small notebook which he consulted: no doubt it was Caffié's cash book, simple and primitive like everything that related to the habits of the old businessman, governed by the strictest economy, both in spending and in work.
- From this notebook," said the superintendent to his secretary, "it would appear that 35 or 36,000 francs were taken from the till; but a considerable amount of securities and valuables were left behind.
Saniel, who had finished his report, did not take his eyes off the notebook, and what he could see reassured him. Obviously, this bookkeeping was reduced to a minimum: a date, a name, a sum, and after this sum a capital P which, no doubt, meant paid, or some other hieroglyphic sign, and that was all; it therefore seemed unlikely that with such a system, Caffié would ever have taken the trouble to write down the numbers of the notes that passed through his hands; in any case, if he did, it was not in this notebook. Would we find another one?
- My report is finished," he said, "here it is.
- Since I've got you, can you give me some information about the victim's habits and the people he entertained?
- Not at all, I'd only known him for a short time, and he was only my client as I was his, by chance: he was handling a case for me, and I had just given him some advice; he was extremely diabetic; the murderer only brought forward his death by a very short time, by a few days.
- It doesn't matter, he brought it forward.
- Oh, perfectly. Besides, if he's good at cutting people's necks, perhaps he's not so good at diagnosing their illnesses.
- It's probable," replied the commissaire, smiling.
- You think he's a butcher?
- There are certain presumptions.
- The knife?
- It may have been stolen or found.
- But the way it was used?
- That, it seems to me, is the point from which we must start.
Saniel couldn't stay any longer, so he got up to leave.
- You know my address," he said; "but I must warn you that, if you need me, I'm leaving tomorrow for Nice; besides, I'll only be away long enough to get there and back.
- If we need you, it will probably not be for several days; we are not going to walk very fast in the unknown where we are.
XV
On his way home along the rue des Petits-Champs, Saniel walked briskly. If, more than once, his emotions had been poignant during this long session, on the whole he could only be satisfied with his results: the concierge had not seen him, that was now established; the hypothesis of the butcher's knife had been put forward in such a way as to make its way; finally, it seemed likely that Caffié had not taken the numbers of his tickets.
But had they been written down, and had the notebook containing them been discovered later, the danger was not immediate. In fact, while he was writing his report and listening to the concierge's deposition, his mind, instead of focusing on these two things, had, by a strange anomaly, run to a third: then, as if by a sort of inspiration, he had found the means which had always eluded him when he was searching for it with all the strength of his application, -- and which consisted in getting rid of the banknotes that very evening, without destroying them; to do this he had only to divide them into small packets, put them in envelopes, and entrust them, under various initials, to the poste restante, which would keep them faithfully until the day when he could ask for them again without compromising himself. 
In the concierge's statement, in the trail indicated by the knife, in the invention of the poste restante, there were therefore just grounds for satisfaction that could make his breath free; decidedly luck seemed to be with him, and he could have told himself that all was for the best, had he not committed the truly mad imprudence of entering this café. What did he need to establish himself there and stay long enough to attract attention? To avoid the attention of passers-by, he had exposed himself to the curiosity of the café staff; quite an affair really, and worthy of a fool who has lost his head! Had he been told this by an intelligent man, he would have refused to believe it, but for him it was true. What would be the consequences of this blunder? That was impossible to predict. None, perhaps. And perhaps very serious ones. In these conditions of uncertainty, the best thing to do was to pretend it hadn't happened, and try to forget about it; what was urgent for the moment was the banknotes, and he had only them to think about.
When he got home and his door was closed, he immediately put his idea into practice: from the three bundles of notes he made ten packets, so as to form a small volume, folded each one in a sheet of strong paper, placed it in an envelope simply gummed, and on this envelope he wrote two letters of the alphabet following each other, starting with A, and two numbers starting with 1 and also following each other: A. B. 12, -- C. D. 34, -- E. F. 56; -- then he addressed them poste restante to the first ten Paris offices listed on his almanac. This logical and easy-to-remember order enabled him not to keep a note of this combination, and thus to defy any search if one were ever made. It was not for thirty thousand francs that he had killed Caffié, it was simply for three thousand; and since he had thought of burning these notes, he could now, without worry, expose himself to losing some of them.
When this idea of the poste restante had occurred to him, he had told himself that he would throw his envelopes into the box nearest his home, which would finish everything; But as he was about to leave, he thought that these ten letters with more or less the same description, found in a heap in the same box, might provoke curiosity, and he resolved to divide them into five or six offices, where he would carry them himself, on foot, without taking a carriage, although he now had enough to pay for it, because the coachman who would have driven him might one day become a formidable witness. 
After the day's mad dash through the woods and fields, after the emotions of the evening, he felt broken and weary from a weariness he knew nothing about, but he understood that he was not at liberty to listen to this weariness. A new situation had been created for him which had the peculiarity that he ceased to belong to himself and would henceforth be, and remain for the rest of his life, the prisoner of his crime; it would be this crime which, from this evening onwards, would be in charge and which he would have to obey.
How could he not have foreseen this situation when, weighing at such length the pros and cons, as an intelligent man who can scrutinise the future from every angle, he had considered what should happen? But however surprising it was, the discovery was nonetheless an incontrovertible certainty, and the unfortunate and disturbing proof that emerged was that, no matter how intelligent you are or how intelligent you think you are, you can always learn from experience.
What else would he learn? He had to admit to himself that he was facing the unknown, and all he could hope for was that this lesson he was receiving from the facts would be the hardest; as for imagining that it was the last, that would have been madness: one would see.
For the moment, it was just a question of the letters he had prepared, and whether he was tired or not, he had to get rid of them as quickly as possible: he took them and set off straight away, going through the streets that were becoming deserted and dark, from the office in the rue Cambon to the one in the place Ventedour, from the rue de Choiseul to the place de la Bourse, and so on until he had finished.
By the time he got home, it had been quite a long time since one o'clock in the morning; he went straight to bed and slept a heavy, dreamless sleep.
It was broad daylight when he opened his eyes the next morning; surprised at having slept so late, he jumped out of bed: his watch showed eight o'clock; but as he wasn't due to leave until eleven fifteen, he had plenty of time.
What could he do with it?
It was the first time in years that he had asked himself such a question, as every morning he always found that he was three or four hours short of his schedule.
He dressed slowly, which was slow for a man who usually took ten minutes to get dressed, but it was still only eight twenty.
Then he thought of writing to Philis to let her know about his trip, but immediately changed his mind and decided to go and tell her himself.
The previous year, he had treated Madame Cormier for an attack of paralysis, and he was able, on condition that he did not repeat his visits too often, to go to her house without appearing to come to see Philis: it was in passing, to get news of a patient in whom he was interested by the very fact that he had cured her, and whose recovery he wanted to follow.
At the time he was treating her, Madame Cormier was living in the rue des Moines in Les Batignolles, on a small ground floor at the end of a garden, which he had moved her from because it was too damp, to a fifth floor where she could find air and light. At nine o'clock he knocked on her door.
- Come in," answered a man's voice.
He was surprised, because in the time he had been coming here almost every day, he had never met a man. Who was that answering as if he were at home? He turned the key in the lock and found himself in a dark hallway from which the voice had obviously come, but where he saw no one, the person who had answered being hidden by a curtain that divided the hallway in two. Increasingly surprised, for he had not yet seen the curtain, he knocked on the dining room door; this time it was Philis' clear voice that answered:
- Come in.
He opened the door and, in front of a large table set against the window, he saw Philis, dressed in a grey smock, at work. Small cardboard boxes were spread out on the table and she had a watercolour box with a glass whose water was dirty from washing the brushes.
At the sound of footsteps on the parquet floor, she turned her head and was instantly on her feet; but she held back the cry, the name that had risen to her lips:
- Mama," she said, "it's Dr Saniel.
Immediately Madame Cormier left the kitchen and entered the room, walking with difficulty, for although Saniel had put her back on her feet, he had not given her back the suppleness and ease of youth.
After the first pleasantries had been exchanged, Saniel explained that, as he had a visit to make to Batignolles, he had not wanted to come and see his patient without seeing her and asking her how she was.
While Madame Cormier explained, with the prolixity of patients, what she was feeling and also what she was surprised not to be feeling, Philis looked at Saniel, worried to find his face so convulsed. Surely something very serious had happened; her visit said as much. But what was it? Her anxiety was heightened by the fact that he avoided looking at her. Why was he doing that? She had done nothing and could find nothing to reproach herself about.
At that moment the door to the hall opened and a tall young man with a curly blond beard entered the room: the man from the hall, Saniel thought as he examined him.
- My son," said Madame Cormier.
- My brother Florentin, whom we've spoken of so often," said Philis.
Florentin! So he had become a fool for not thinking that this man, hidden from him by the curtain and answering like a master when someone knocked, could only be Philis's brother? Was he so deeply upset that such simple reasoning was impossible? It was definitely important for him to leave as soon as possible; the journey would calm his panic-stricken nervous machine.
- People have written to me," said Florentin, "and since my return they have told me how good you were to my mother. Allow me to thank you for this with a moved and grateful heart; I hope that soon this gratitude will not remain an empty word.
- Let's not talk about that," said Saniel, looking at Philis with a frankness and an open face that reassured her to a certain extent. If the word were not barbarous, I would say that her illness has been good fortune for me.
Then, to divert the conversation, and above all to try to tell Philis that he wanted to talk to her alone for a short while, he approached the table:
- And what charming things are you doing here, mademoiselle?
- Oh, charming! I don't know if, by working conscientiously, I would ever have acquired a talent that would have allowed me to do charming things; but I'm reduced to the trade, and the trade has to be content with a little. Look at these twelve menus: they all have one and the same design, and that's how I have to make something at the end of the day.
Saying this, she dipped her brush into her colour box, established the shade she wanted on the bottom of a broken plate she was using as a palette, and quickly applied this shade to each of these twelve menus.
- It saves time and colour," she said; "but with processes like these, which are a necessity, how can I think of making something charming? I'd like to try, though... if I had the time.
- Life has its difficulties, and for everyone. You have to work only for pleasure...
- Then we wouldn't be doing anything," said Florentin blithely.
- Will you shut up, you lazy bastard!" cried Philis.
Saniel gave some advice to Madame Cormier, then got up to leave.
Philis followed him, and Florentin seemed to want to go with them, but she stopped him:
- I have a question for Mr Saniel," she said.
When they reached the landing, she pulled the vestibule door shut completely.
- What is it?" she asked in a hurried, trembling voice.
- I wanted to warn you that I'm leaving for Monaco at eleven.
- Are you?
- I've received 200 francs from a client and I'm going to gamble it away. Two hundred francs can't pay Jardine or the others; gambling, they can give me a few thousand francs.
- Oh, poor dear, how desperate you must be to have such an idea!
- Am I wrong?
- Never wrong in my eyes, in my heart, in my love! May fortune be with you, my beloved?
- Give me your hand.
She looked around, listening: no one, no noise.
Then, drawing him to her, she put her lips to his:
- All yours, with you!
- I'll be back on Tuesday.
- Tuesday, at five o'clock, I'll arrive.
XVI
Nobody knew as little about gambling as Saniel: he knew they played in Monaco, that's all; and in Paris he had taken his ticket for Monaco, where he got out of the carriage.
On leaving the station, he looked around to get his bearings; seeing nothing resembling a gambling house as he understood it, i.e. the Royat casino, the only establishment of its kind he had ever seen, he asked a passer-by:
- The gaming house, please?
- We don't gamble in Monaco.
- I thought not.
- They play in Monte Carlo.
- And is Monte Carlo far away?
- Over there.
With his hand, the passer-by pointed to a green spot on the slope of the mountain where, amidst the foliage, the roofs and facades of large buildings could be seen.
He thanked him and headed that way, while the passer-by, calling out to another, recounted the request that had just been made of him; and they both laughed and shrugged their shoulders: could anyone be as stupid as those Parisians! Another man about to be fleeced, and who'd come all the way from Paris just for that! Was he funny with his long legs and long arms! Can you play with a face like that?
Without worrying about the laughter he heard behind him, Saniel continued on his way, watching the blue sea shimmer under the oblique rays of the sun, already low on the horizon. Despite the night spent in the carriage, he felt no fatigue; on the contrary, he was at ease in body and mind; the journey had calmed the restlessness of his nerves, and it was with perfect tranquillity that he contemplated what had happened before his departure. In his present state of calm, he no longer had to fear any blunders or fits of madness, and since he had regained his will, everything would be all right: no more looking back, let alone forward, only the present had to occupy him.
The present, at that moment, was the game. What was the game? What was the game? Roulette, he knew; but what roulette was, he didn't know. He would do as his neighbours did. If they laughed at him, it didn't matter; in fact, he must have wanted them to laugh at him: we remember with pleasure those we have laughed at; what he was looking for in this country was precisely to be remembered.
When he entered the gaming rooms, he noticed that a religious silence reigned there: around a large table covered with a green cloth carpet divided by drawings and numbers, people were sitting on the high chairs from which they appeared to be standing; others on lower chairs or simply standing around the table were pushing or picking up louis and banknotes from the green cloth, and a loud voice repeated in a monotone: "Gentlemen, make your bet! The game is up! Then a small ivory ball was thrown into a cylinder where it rolled with a metallic noise. Although he had never seen a roulette wheel, it took no effort on his part to guess that it was one.
And before putting the few louis he already had in his hand on the table, he looked around to see how it was done. But no matter how hard he tried, after the tenth game he had not understood any better than after the first: with rakes the croupiers collected the stakes from certain players; with these same rakes they doubled, tenfolded or even paid out in proportions that he did not realise to certain others, and that was all.
Anyway, it didn't matter; he thought he had seen how they put their money on the table, and that was enough. He had five louis in his hand when the croupier said "Gentlemen, place your bets"; he placed them on number 32, or at least he thought he was placing them on that number. "Rien ne va plus! The ball rolled into the cylinder that the croupier had spun.
- 31!" called the croupier, who added a few other words that Saniel either misheard or did not understand.
However little he knew about roulette, he thought he had lost: he had placed his bet on 32, it was 31 that came up, the bank had won. He was surprised to see the croupier push a pile of gold at him, which must have amounted to a hundred louis, or thereabouts, and accompany this movement with a glance which, without any possible doubt, meant: "Yours, sir!
What was he to do? Since he had lost, he could not pick up the money sent to him by mistake.
He had laid down his bet by leaning over the shoulder of a gentleman with hair and a beard of an unbelievable black, who, without playing, was picking a card with a pin. The gentleman turned to him and, with a most amiable smile, in the most gracious tone of voice:
- To you, sir," he said.
Decidedly, he had been mistaken in thinking that he had lost, and he had to pick up that pile of louis; which he did, but he forgot to pick up his first bet as well.
The roulette wheel was spinning again.
- 32!" called the croupier.
Saniel had just realised that his five louis had been left on 32, and he thought he had won since that was the number that had just come up, and his ignorance did not extend to not knowing that a roulette number is paid thirty-six times its stake: the croupier's rake was therefore going to push one hundred and eighty louis on him.
But, to his great surprise, he didn't push any more than he had on the first shot. This was becoming incomprehensible: they paid him when he lost, and when he won they only gave him half of what he was owed.
His face betrayed his astonishment so well that he saw a mocking smile in the eyes of the black-haired man, who had turned towards him again.
As he was playing to play, not to win or lose, he pocketed what had just been sent to him, as well as his stake.
- Since you are no longer playing," said the kind gentleman as he left his chair, "would you allow me to have a word with you?
Saniel bowed and they moved away from the table; when they were far enough away not to disturb the players' contemplation, the gentleman saluted ceremoniously:
- Allow me to introduce myself: Prince Mazzazoli.
Saniel thought he should reply by giving his name and title.
- Well, doctor," said the prince in a strong Italian accent, "I hope you'll forgive me for a simple observation that my age perhaps allows: you play like a child.
- Like an ignoramus," replied Saniel without getting angry, for, however unusual this observation was, he had already calculated that it might be good for the future to have to invoke the testimony of a prince.
- I'm sure you're still wondering why you were paid eighteen times your stake on the first move you made, and why you weren't paid thirty-six times your stake on the second.
- That's true, isn't it?
- Well, I'll tell you. It's because, instead of placing your money on the number you had chosen, you placed it astride 31 and 32: by a stroke of luck that is enviable, the result was the same for you; but what would that luck not give if, instead of relying on chance, it were illuminated! Roulette is not a game of chance, as some people wrongly believe: it is all about calculation and combination. So, by placing your money on two numbers, you had five chances against you, just as you would have had six and a half on three numbers, or seven on four. That's what you need to know before risking anything, and that's what I'm offering you if you want us to form a partnership until this evening. Your luck combined with my experience will break the bank.
Saniel had not waited for this conclusion to guess more or less what she was going to be: a beggar, this old Italian prince so well dyed.
- My intention is not to gamble any more," he said.
- With your luck, that would be more than a mistake.
- I needed a certain sum, I won it, it's enough for me.
- You wouldn't be foolish enough to refuse the hand that Fortune is holding out to you.
- Are you sure she's holding out her hand to me?" said Saniel, who thought it was the prince.
- Don't doubt it; I'll prove it to you...
- Thank you; I never go back on what I have decided.
At any other time, Saniel would have turned his back on this intruder; but he was a witness who had to be spared.
- I have nothing more to do here," he said politely; "allow me to withdraw after thanking you for your offer, which I appreciate.
-- Well," exclaimed the prince, "since you don't want to run out of luck, let me do it for you; this money can be a fetish, take five louis, just five louis, and entrust them to me; I will play them according to my combinations, which are certain, and this evening I will give you your share of the profits. Where are you staying? I live in the Villa des Palmes.
- Nowhere; I'm on my way.
- So meet me tonight at ten o'clock in this room and we'll wind up our association.
His first instinct was to refuse. What's the point of giving charity to this old monkey? But, after all, it wasn't very much to pay his witness five louis, and he gave it to him.
- A thousand pardons! Tonight at ten o'clock.
As Saniel was about to leave the room, he found himself face to face with his old friend Duphot, who was entering accompanied by a woman - the same woman he had treated.
- You here? Ah! for example, she's very good.
And both the lover and the mistress exclaimed.
Saniel explained why he had come to Monaco and what he had done since his arrival.
- With my money! Ah, that's a good one," exclaimed Duphot.
- And you don't gamble any more? asked the woman.
- I have what I need.
- So you're going to play for me.
He tried to defend himself, but they dragged him over to the roulette table and each put a louis in his hand.
- Play.
- How do you play?
- As inspiration would advise: you're lucky.
But his luck was running out; the two louis they had thrown at random were lost.
He was given two more; this time they won eight.
- You see, dear friend.
He continued with varying degrees of success, winning and losing.
After a quarter of an hour he was allowed to give up the game.
- And what are you going to do now?" asked Duphot.
- Send what I owe my creditor by telegraphic order.
- Do you know where the telegraph is?
- No, I don't know.
- I'll take you there.
It was a second witness whose help Saniel could not refuse.
When he had sent his money order to Jardine, he had nothing more to do in Monte Carlo, and as he could only leave in the evening, at eleven o'clock, he remained idle, not knowing what to do with his time. So he bought a Nice newspaper and went to sit in the garden, under a gas burner, facing the calm, dark sea. Perhaps he would find some telegraph dispatch in the paper that would tell him what had happened in the Rue Sainte-Anne since he left.
He searched long enough; then at the end of the paper, in the Latest News section, he read: "The crime in the Rue Sainte-Anne seems to have entered a new phase; more careful investigations have led to the discovery of a trouser button to which a piece of cloth adheres. This proves that before the crime there was a struggle between the victim and his killer. As the button bears certain letters and marks, it is a valuable clue for the police.
This evidence of a struggle between the victim and his killer made Saniel smile: if the police went down this road, they would go a long way to achieving a result. Who knew how long that button had been in the room, which was not very well swept? Who had it come from?
Suddenly, leaving his bench, he entered a grove and quickly felt around: wasn't it he who had lost the button?
But he was soon ashamed of this unconscious movement: the button that the police were so proud to have discovered did not belong to him; the new path they had just embarked upon would not lead to him.
XVII
On Tuesday, a little before five o'clock, Philis, as she had promised, rang her doorbell and he came out of his laboratory, where he had gone back to work, to open the door.
She jumped at his neck:
- Well?" she asked, her voice trembling.
He told her how he had gambled, how he had won, but without specifying the sum; and he also told her about Prince Mazzazoli's partnership proposals, about meeting Duphot, about sending the telegraphic order to Jardine.
- Oh, what happiness," she said, hugging him, "you're free now.
- No more creditors! Master of me: you see I had a good inspiration.
- It was the right thing to do.
Then, interrupting herself, she said:
- Speaking of justice, you didn't mention Caffié to me the morning you left.
- I was so preoccupied that I didn't have time to think about Caffié.
- It's strange, this coincidence of his death with the conviction we brought against him: doesn't that prove the justice of things?
- If you like.
- As the money you earned in Monaco proves for you: what is just necessarily happens. Caffié was punished for all his misdeeds and crimes; you were rewarded for your suffering.
- Wouldn't it have been fair if Caffié had been punished sooner and I had suffered less?
She remained without answering.
- You see," he said, smiling, "that your philosophy remains short.
- It's not my philosophy I'm thinking about, it's Caffié and us.
- In what way can Caffié be associated with you or yours?
- He is, or rather he could be, if the justice in which I believe, despite your jokes, allowed him to be.
- You will agree that this sounds like an enigma.
- What have you learned about Caffié since you left?
- Nothing or almost nothing.
- You know that the crime is believed to have been committed by a butcher.
- The superintendent picked up the knife in front of me, and it's definitely a butcher's knife; what's more, the blow that cut Caffié's throat was delivered by a hand used to cutting throats; that's what I said in my report.
- Since then, a more careful search has uncovered a trouser button under a piece of furniture...
- I read that in a newspaper, but I don't believe it was a struggle: Caffié's position in the chair where he was hit and where he died indicates that the old rascal was surprised; moreover, if he hadn't been surprised, if he had struggled, he would have shouted, and without doubt he would have made himself heard.
- If you only knew how happy I am to hear you say that," she exclaimed.
- How happy! What do you care?
He looked at her surprised.
- What does it matter to you whether Caffié was killed with or without a struggle? You condemned him, he's dead; that should be enough for you.
- I was quite wrong to pass that sentence, just talking and without attaching any importance to it.
- Do you think it was my mistake that led to his execution?
- I don't have that simplicity, but in the end I'd rather not have condemned him?
- Do you regret it?
- I regret that he's dead.
- Decidedly the enigma continues; but you know that I'm not at all into it; and, if you like, we'll leave it at that; we have better things to do than talk about Caffié.
- On the contrary, allow me to talk about it, because we need your advice.
He looked at her again, trying to read her mind and to guess why she was so keen to talk about Caffié, when he himself would have liked not to. What could be behind this insistence?
- I'm listening to you," he said, "and since you have some advice to ask me on the subject, you should have told me straight away what it was all about.
- You're right, and I would have already done so if I weren't held back by a feeling of embarrassment... and shame that I blame myself for, because with you I should have neither embarrassment nor shame.
- Of course not.
- But first of all I have to tell you, you have to know that my brother Florentin is a good and brave boy; you have to believe it, you have to be convinced.
- I am, because you tell me so; besides, he made the best impression on me in the short time I saw him at your house the other morning.
- Isn't it immediately obvious that he's a good person?
- He certainly is.
- And frank, and upright; weak, it's true, and a bit soft too, that is to say lacking in spring and will, letting himself be carried away... by kindness and tenderness. This weakness caused him to make a mistake before he left for America. I have hidden it from you until now, but you must know it now: loving a woman who dominated him and made him do what she wanted, he allowed himself to be led into... embezzle a sum of forty-five francs that she asked him for, that she demanded the same evening, hoping to be able to hand it over three days later, without his boss noticing.
- Was her boss Caffié?
- No; he had left Caffié three months earlier and gone to work for another businessman whom I never told you about, so now you understand why. He missed the money he had counted on to replace the one he had given to this woman. Instead of coming to us, he looked elsewhere, couldn't find it, lost his head, so much so that his embezzlement was discovered and his boss, who was no less hard-line than Caffié, lodged a complaint against him. It would take too long to explain how we managed to get the complaint withdrawn and prevent the poor boy from going to court. Finally we succeeded, and in despair, dying of shame, he left for America, in spite of us, as much to avoid being ashamed in front of anyone as to make his fortune, for his character is as easy to delude as it is to despair. Now that you've seen Florentin, you'll admit that you can be guilty of the crime he committed without being capable... of becoming a murderer.
He was about to answer, but she closed her lips with a quick gesture:
- You'll see why I'm talking about this, and you'll also understand that I didn't stray from Caffié, or from the button the police are counting on to find the culprit: that button belonged to Florentin.
- Your brother's?
- Yes, Florentin, who was at Caffié's on the very day of the crime.
- It's true; the concierge told the police commissioner that he came around three o'clock.
Philis cried out in despair:
- We know he came, which is even more serious than we could have imagined or feared.
- But, as this visit took place between three and half past three, and the crime was certainly committed between five and half past five, nobody can accuse your brother of being the murderer, as he had left before Caffié lit his lamp. As this lamp could not have lit itself, it follows that he could not have slit the throat of a man who was still alive an hour after the concierge had seen your brother and spoken to him.
- What you tell me is a great relief; if you only knew what a fright we were in!
- You were very quick to be alarmed.
- Too quickly; but when Florentin, reading the newspaper aloud to us, came to the story of the button and exclaimed: "But it's mine, that button!" we all felt a shock that made us lose our heads. We saw the police descending on our house, questioning Florentin, blaming him for the past that would be splashed all over the newspapers, and you must feel our emotion.
- But your brother can explain how he lost that button at Caffié's, can't he?
- Of course, and in the most natural way. As the concierge told us, on the day of the murder he went to Caffié's house to ask for a certificate stating that he had been his clerk for several years. Caffié gave him this certificate, which was to replace the one Florentin had lost; then, as we talked, Caffié told him about a file he could not find and which he needed. It was Florentin who had taken more care of this matter than Caffié himself, and when it was finished, he had put the file, which was bulky and could not fit into the boxes where they are usually filed, on a board at the top of a cupboard. As chance would have it, he remembered; he told Caffié, who replied that he had searched the cupboard without finding anything. You have searched incorrectly," said Florentin, "or the file has been disturbed by my successor. -- I did look," replied Caffié, "and your successor never saw it. -- Well, then," said Florentin, "I'll find it. And fetching a small ladder, he climbed up to the top of the cupboard. His memory had not deceived him: the file was indeed where he thought it was, but a thick layer of black dust had obscured the card on which were written the indications that should make it recognisable. He picked it up to take it down, took a false step and, in a sudden movement to restrain himself, one of the buttons on his trousers was ripped off.
- And he didn't pick it up?
- He didn't even notice at first; it was only later, in the street, when he saw that one leg of his trousers was longer than the other and was dragging on his boots, that he thought of the ladder and realised that a button was missing. He wasn't going to go back to Caffié's to look for it, was he?
- Of course not.
- How could he foresee that Caffié would be murdered; that the crime would be skilfully planned and executed enough to let the culprit escape; that, two days later, the police would find a button on which they would build a whole story; that, from this story, it follows that there was a struggle between the assassin and his victim; that in this struggle a button was torn off, and that the one who lost it was necessarily the one who cut Caffié's neck? Florentin didn't think about all that.
- That's understandable.
- That evening he replaced his button with another, and it was only when he read the newspaper that he realised what a serious matter this seemingly insignificant event could be, and like him, we shared his emotion.
- You didn't tell anyone about this button?
- Of course not; we weren't watching; and I only told you about it because I'm telling you everything, and also because, if we were threatened, we could only expect help from you. Florentin is a good boy, but he's a sheep who only knows how to stretch out his back when it's raining on him; Mum is like him in more ways than one, and I, although I'm more resistant, I confess that in the face of the law and the police I would easily lose my head, like children who start screaming when they're left in the dark; isn't the law the night, when you don't know it, and a disturbing night, full of frights, peopled with ghosts?
- I don't think that you are threatened as you imagined in your first moment of emotion...
- Very natural.
- Very natural, I agree, but which reflection shows to be unfounded. This button does not bear the name of the tailor who supplied it...
- No, but it does bear initials and a trademark: an A and a P with a crown and a cockerel.
- Well, how do you expect the police to find, among the two or three thousand tailors in Paris, those who use buttons marked in this way? And how can these tailors be expected to identify the client to whom the button belongs, this one and not another? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Where did your brother get these trousers made? Didn't he bring them back from America?
- The poor boy didn't bring anything from America apart from some poor, well-worn clothes, and we had to start by dressing him from head to toe. We were thrifty, and a little tailor on the Avenue de Clichy, called Valérius, made him this suit.
-- I don't think it's very likely that the police will find this tailor on the Avenue de Clichy, although it would have been better if the trousers had come from La Belle Jardinière or another department stores': but if they did, and if the tailor recognised that the button came from his stock, it wouldn't point to your brother. Finally, if we could get to him, we would still have to prove that there had been a struggle, as is supposed, and that the button had been ripped off in the struggle, and that your brother was in the Rue Sainte-Anne between five and six o'clock, when it would no doubt be easy for him to prove where he was at the time.
- But at home, with Mum!
- So you can see that you can rest easy.
XVIII
Reassured, Philis was in a hurry to return to the rue des Moines to share with her mother and brother the confidence that Saniel had put in her heart: it was with hurried steps that she went up the rue Louis-le-Grand to Les Batignolles and with a feverish hand she pulled the cord of their doorbell.
For the time had gone when, in this quiet house where all the tenants knew each other, the key was left on the door and all you had to do was knock before entering. Since the newspapers carried the story of the button found at Caffié's, the freedom and security that had reigned in this house, where until then there had been nothing to fear and nothing to hide, had disappeared; no more keys on the front door, no more loud conversations, no more laughter: Now, the door always remained closed; we no longer laughed; and when we spoke, when we read the newspapers we bought morning and evening, it was in mid-voice, as if, behind the walls, ears had been on the lookout; the doorbell tinkled and we looked at each other with emotion, wondering with a fearful glance if it was not the announcement of danger. 
When her brother came to open the door, she found the table served: they were waiting for her.
- I was afraid something had happened to you," said Mrs Cormier.
- I've been detained.
She quickly got rid of her hat and frock coat.
- Didn't you learn anything?" asked Madame Cormier as she brought the soup to the table.
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't they tell you anything?" Florentin continued in a low voice.
- That's all I've been told; or that's all I've heard, when I wasn't being spoken to directly.
- What are they saying?
- No one will admit that the police are investigating the button.
- You see, Florentin," interrupted Mrs Cormier, smiling at her son.
But he shook his head.
- But everyone's opinion has value," cried Philis.
- Speak lower," said Florentin.
- It is argued that it is impossible for the police to find, among the two or three thousand tailors in Paris, all those who use buttons marked A. P.; and it is said that, if they were found, they would not be able to name those of their customers to whom they have supplied buttons of this kind; so that it is really like looking for a needle in a haystack.
- When you put your mind to it, you can find a needle in a haystack," says Florentin.
- You ask me what I heard, I'll tell you again. But I didn't stop there. As I was passing near the rue Louis-le-Grand, I went up to M. Saniel's: it was time for his consultation and I was hoping to find him.
- Did you tell him about the situation?" exclaimed Florentin.
In any other circumstances, she would have answered frankly, explaining that Saniel could be trusted; but it wasn't when she saw how agitated her brother was that she was going to exasperate him with this confession, especially as she couldn't give the reasons for her faith in Saniel at the same time; so she had to reassure him first of all.
- No," she said, "but I could talk to M. Saniel about Caffié without him being surprised; since it was he who made the first observations, wasn't it only natural that my curiosity should want to know a little more than what the newspapers say?
- All the same, it may seem a strange thing to do.
- I don't think so; but, in any case, the interest we had in finding out made me overlook this consideration, and I think that, when I have told you M. Saniel's opinion, you will no longer regret my visit.
- And this opinion?" asked Madame Cormier.
- His opinion is that there was no struggle between Caffié and the assassin, since Caffié's position in the chair where he was hit proves that he was surprised; therefore, if there was no struggle, there was no button torn off, and the whole police scaffolding collapses.
Madame Cormier heaved a deep sigh of relief:
- You see!" she said to her son.
- And M. Saniel's opinion is not that of just anyone, it's not even that of just any doctor: it's that of the doctor who witnessed the death and who, more than anyone else, has the authority to say how it happened -- by surprise, without a struggle, without the button being torn off.
- It is not M. Saniel who directs the police investigations, nor who inspires them," replied Florentin; "his opinion does not point to a culprit, whereas the button may point to one, at least for those who believe in a struggle, and between the two the police cannot hesitate: already they are mocked in the papers for not yet having discovered the murderer, who will join all those they have let escape, they must follow the trail they have set out on, and this trail..." He lowered his voice.
He lowered his voice:
- This is where she can take him.
- To do that, she would have to go via the Avenue de Clichy, and that seems unlikely.
- It's the possible that torments me, not the plausible, and you can't fail to recognise that what I fear is possible: I was at Caffié's the day of the crime, I lost a button torn off there with violence, this button picked up by the police proves, according to them, the guilt of the person to whom it belonged; if they find that I'm that person...
- She won't find it.
- ... Let's say she does find him, how can I defend myself?
- By proving that you were not in the Rue Sainte-Anne between five and six o'clock, since you were here.
- And what witnesses will testify to this alibi? I have only one: my mother. What good is a mother's testimony on behalf of her son in such circumstances?
- You'll have the doctor's testimony that there was no struggle, and therefore no button was torn off.
- A doctor's opinion that another doctor's opinion can combat and destroy! And then, to demonstrate that there was no struggle, Mr Saniel points to surprise. Who could have surprised Caffié? It wasn't the first person to come along, was it? Likewise, it wasn't the first person to sneak into the house, go in and out, escaping the concierge's surveillance. This person, of course, knew all about the habits of the house. What's more, he knew that to get Caffié to open the door after the clerk had left, you had to ring the bell first and then knock three times in a certain way. Who knew all that better than me?
Philis defended herself against her brother foot by foot, but little by little the confidence that had sustained her at first was weakening. At Saniel's, close to him, she was valiant; between her brother and her mother, in this room which had already seen their worries, not daring to raise her voice, she became confused and let herself be won over by the anxiety of her family:
- Really," she said, "we seem to be guilty and not innocent!
- And while we're here tormenting ourselves, the culprit is probably in perfect peace, laughing at the police investigations; he hadn't thought of that button, chance has put it in his game; luck is for him, it's against us... once again.
This was the complaint that most often came to Florentin's lips. Although he had never been a gambler, and for good reason, everything for him was decided by luck. Some people are born under a lucky star, others under an unlucky one; there are those who, in the battle of life, take the blows without getting discouraged, because they expect everything from tomorrow, just as there are those who falter, because they expect nothing good and know from experience that tomorrow will be for them what the present day is, what the day before was. He was one of them. What had been good since the battle began? Why had their father died at the very moment when, after a lot of hard work and perseverance, he had managed to get his foot on the ladder? A few more years and his children would have inherited a fortune and a glorious name, while he had left them only what he had always had: poverty. Why hadn't he been able to complete his studies himself, instead of becoming a poor businessman's clerk who was burdened with tedious work from morning till night, and so tired that he didn't have an hour's freedom left to do any useful work? Shouldn't he, like his comrades, have taken examinations that would have given him a position similar to those occupied by these comrades, neither more intelligent nor more courageous than he? Why, instead of finding a good man as a boss, which was not impossible, had he fallen on Caffié who had martyred and dumbed him down? Why had his mother, who had been born in the country, was strong and in good health, suddenly been struck down by paralysis? And why couldn't Philis, a beautiful girl as she was, cheerful in spite of everything, intelligent, endowed with all the qualities that make for a happy life in a household, find a husband free enough from prejudice and narrow-minded calculations to marry her? Why was it that, from morning to night, without rest or weariness, she worked bent over her table, or ran through the streets of Paris like a poor labourer looking for or putting off work?
- Why didn't I stay in America! he said.
- Since you were too unhappy, my poor boy!" said Madame Cormier, whose maternal heart had been stirred by this cry.
- Am I happier here? Will I be tomorrow? What does tomorrow hold for us, this tomorrow full of uncertainty and danger?
- Why do you want him to have only dangers?" said Philis in a conciliatory and caressing tone.
- You're always waiting for the right one.
- At least I hope so, and don't take it for granted that it's impossible. I'm not saying that life is always rosy, but it's not always black either; and I think it's like the seasons: after winter, which is ugly, I grant you, comes spring, summer and autumn.
- Well, if I had the money to travel, I'd go and spend the end of winter in a country where it would be less unpleasant than here, and above all less dangerous for my constitution.
- You're not saying that seriously, I hope?" exclaimed Madame Cormier.
- Quite seriously, on the contrary.
- We've hardly got together, and you're thinking of a new separation," said Madame Cormier sadly.
- Florentin isn't thinking of a separation," cried Philis, "he's thinking of running away.
- And why not?
- Because only guilty people run away.
- It's precisely the opposite; the intelligent guilty ones stay, by virtue of your axiom, and, as they're generally resolute people, they know in advance that they'll be able to face up to the danger; whereas the innocent ones, who are everyone else, timid people like me or the unlucky ones, lose their heads and run away, because they also know in advance that, if danger threatens them, it will crush them and they won't be able to escape. That's why I'd go back to America if I could pay my way: at least I'd be safe there.
There was a moment's silence, and everyone remained with their eyes fixed on their plates, as if they had no other concern than to finish their dinner.
- When I realised that this project wasn't feasible," Florentin soon continued, "I had another idea.
- Why do you have ideas?" asked Philis.
- I'd like you to be in my place, and we'll see if you don't have any.
- I assure you that I am, in your place, and that your concern is mine; it's just that it doesn't translate in the same way. So what's your idea?
- It's to go and see Valerius and tell him everything.
- And who can vouch for Valerius's discretion?" asked Madame Cormier. "Wouldn't that be the most reckless thing you could do? You don't play with a secret of this importance.
- Valérius is a good man.
- It's because he can't work when political, or rather patriotic, affairs are going badly that you're saying that.
- And why not? In a poor wretch who lives so meagrely from his work, isn't this concern and pride for his country the mark of an elevated heart?
- I'll give you that; but that's all the more reason to be careful with him," says Philis. Precisely because he may be what you think, we have to be cautious. You tell him what happened: he accepts it and he accepts your innocence, that's perfect; he won't betray your secret either deliberately or through clumsiness. But he doesn't accept it; he's looking for the other side of the story; he assumes that you wanted to deceive him; he suspects you; so won't he tell everything to the police commissioner in our neighbourhood? As far as I'm concerned, that's a danger he'd be mad to provoke.
- And, in your opinion, what should we do?
- Nothing; that is to say, wait, since the chances are a thousand to one that our worries, which we all exaggerate, will never come true.
- Well, let's wait," he says; "what's more, I like it that way; at least I'm not responsible. Whatever happens will happen.
XIX
For the button found at Caffié's to lead us to the murderer, it had to have come from the hands of a Parisian tailor, or at least a French one, and the trousers had not been sold by a ready-made clothes shop, where neither the names nor the memories of passing buyers are kept.
The police's task was therefore difficult, as were their chances of success.
Had they contacted each of the three thousand tailors in Paris, as Saniel imagined, to find out which of them used Coq and Couronne buttons marked A. P., she would really have been looking for a needle in a haystack.
But that wasn't the way she went about it: instead of going after those who used these buttons, she looked for those who made or sold them, and immediately, without going any further than the Bottin , she found this manufacturer: A. Pélinotte, manufacture de boutons métal pour pantalons, marque de fabrique A. P., Couronne et Coq, faubourg du Temple.
At first, the manufacturer was rather reluctant to answer the questions of the agent who went to his home, but when he began to understand that he could benefit from the case, as a good businessman, young and active as he was, he made his books and his salesmen available to the court. His claim, in fact, was that his buttons, thanks to a copper bar around which the thread was wound instead of passing through holes, never cut the thread and that they were unbreakable: when they did jump, it was with a piece of the fabric. What better justification for his claims, what better claim than a button ripped off with a piece of the murderer's trousers? The case had to go to trial and all the newspapers would be talking about A. P. buttons. He would have paid a good price for this.
All that was asked of him was his help and, after a few days, the search could begin, guided by a list whose accuracy spared unnecessary steps.
One morning, a security guard arrived on the Avenue de Clichy and found the tailor Valérius in his shop, busy reading his newspaper. For it was not only when the country was in danger that Valérius was passionate about reading newspapers, it was every morning and every evening: when political affairs were going badly, he took the worries they caused him so tragically that he needed conversation and, above all, drinks at the café to distract him, and then, of course, he didn't work; On the contrary, when things were going more or less well, no one was more diligent than he, he never left his little shop and, when he had finished reading the morning paper, he only left his scissors to sit down at his sewing machine and, while pressing the pedal, he brooded over what he had read: politics, polemics, news, courts and soaps. 
Nothing published in the newspapers escaped his notice, so when the agent began to speak, he knew at once what was going to be discussed:
- Is it for the Rue Sainte-Anne case that you need this information?
- Frankly, yes.
- Well, frankly too, I don't know whether professional secrecy allows me to answer you.
The agent, who was no fool, realised at once who he was dealing with, and instead of giving in to the urge to laugh provoked by this nobly made reply, by this good man whose long bushy black beard and bald head accentuated his seriousness, he put on a dignified face:
- It's up for discussion," he said.
- So let's talk: a customer who trusts my probity and discretion gives me a pair of trousers to make; he pays me as he should, without cutting any corners and on the day he says; things are done fairly between us; I give him a good pair of trousers honestly made, he pays me in good money. We're square; do I then have the right, through careless words or otherwise, to provide weapons against him? This is a delicate matter.
- Do you put the interests of the individual above those of society?
- When it comes to professional secrecy, yes. Where would we go if lawyers, notaries, doctors, confessors and tailors were to compromise on this point of doctrine? To anarchy, quite simply, and, in the end, it would be the interests of society that would suffer.
The agent, who had no time to lose, was getting impatient.
- I would point out to you," he said, "that a tailor, however important his profession, is not in quite the same position as a doctor or a confessor, who do not keep accounts of what their clients entrust to them. Do you have a book in which you record your customers' orders?
- I certainly do.
- So if, misguided and persevering in a theory pushed to the extreme, you don't want to answer my questions, I would just have to go and get the local superintendent who, by virtue of the powers conferred on him by law, would seize your books...
- That would be violence, and my responsibility would be waived.
- And on the basis of these books, the examining magistrate would see who you had supplied with trousers made from this material; all that would be left to do would be to find out in what interest you had sought to mislead the law.
Saying this, he took a small box from his pocket and, unfolding a piece of tissue paper, pulled out a button to which a piece of navy blue fabric was attached.
Valérius, who was in no way moved by the Commissioner's threat, for he was a man who braved martyrdom, looked curiously at the box; when the agent delicately took out the button, he let out a movement of lively surprise.
- You see," exclaimed the officer, "that you know this fabric!
- Will you allow me to look at it?
- Gladly, but on condition that you don't touch it; it's precious.
Valérius took the box and, approaching the front, looked at the button and the piece of cloth.
- It's a button marked A. P., as you can see, and we know that you use these buttons.
- I won't deny it; they're good buttons, and I only give good buttons to my customers.
Returning the box to the agent, he picked up a large book which he began to leaf through; pieces of cloth were stuck to the pages, and beside them were a few lines of thick writing. When he came to a page with a piece of blue cloth on it, he took the boot and compared it with the button, looking at it in daylight.
- Sir," he cried, "I'm going to tell you some serious things.
- I am listening.
- We have the murderer of the Rue Sainte-Anne, and it is I who will give you the means of discovering him.
- Did you make a pair of trousers from this fabric? I've made three; but there's only one that interests you, that of the murderer. I told you earlier that professional secrecy prevented me from answering your questions; but what I've just seen clears my conscience. As I explained to you, when I have made a good pair of trousers for a customer who has paid me good money for them, I don't think I have the right to reveal that customer's affairs to anyone in the world, including the law.
- I understand," interrupted the impatient agent.
- But this reservation on my part is based on reciprocity: a good customer deserves a good tailor. If the customer is not good, the reciprocity ceases, or rather it continues on another ground, that of war: someone has behaved badly towards me, I return the favour. The trousers to which this fabric belongs," he showed the button, "I made them for a... a private individual I didn't know, who introduced himself to me as an Alsatian, which I accepted all the more readily because he spoke with a strong foreign accent. I don't have to tell you how I looked after these trousers: I'm a patriot, sir. It had been agreed that they would be paid for on delivery. When the delivery took place, the young apprentice who was in charge of it had the weakness not to ask for the money: they were going to bring it to me straight away, in other words, all the tricks of bad debtors. I ran there. I was poorly received and was unable to get anything; it would be for the next day without fail. The next day they threatened to throw me down the stairs. The day after that, they moved out at the drop of a hat. Nobody left. Disappeared; without leaving an address, as you might expect.
- And this customer?
- I'll give you his name without any hesitation: Fritzner, not an Alsatian, as I thought, but definitely a Prussian, who certainly did it; his disappearance the day after the crime is proof of that.
- You say you couldn't get his address?
- But you, who have other means than me, will find it: twenty-seven to thirty years old, average height, blue eyes, blond beard and a blue suit of this fabric.
The agent wrote this description in his notebook as the tailor gave it.
- If he didn't leave Paris with the stolen thirty-five thousand francs, we'll find him," he said, "and it'll be thanks to you.
- I'm happy to be of use to you.
The agent was about to leave; he changed his mind:
- You said you'd made three suits from this fabric.
- Yes, but only the Fritzner suit counts; the other two were made for honest people who are well known in the neighbourhood and who paid me fairly.
- Since they can't be bothered, you shouldn't have any qualms about naming them: I'm not asking you for their names for the sake of justice, but for my own sake; they'll look good in my report and prove that my investigations were thorough.
- One is a shopkeeper in the Rue Truffaut, called M. Blanchet; the other is a young man from America called M. Florentin Cormier.
- Did you say Florentin Cormier?" asked the agent, who remembered that this was the name of a person we had seen at Caffié's on the day of the crime.
- Not exactly; it's the first time I've dressed him; but I know his mother and sister, who have lived in the rue des Moines for five or six years at least; very honest people who work hard and owe nothing to anyone.
The next morning, at about ten o'clock, shortly after Philis had left, Florentin, who was reading the newspaper in the dining room while Madame Cormier was preparing breakfast, heard footsteps, intended to be light, stop on the landing in front of their door. Her ear had become too accustomed to the noises of the house for a few days to be mistaken: there was a hesitation or a precaution in these footsteps that obviously betrayed a stranger; and with the few relations they had, a stranger was surely an enemy -- the one he was expecting.
There was no need to hesitate slowly, and assuming an air of indifference, he went to open the door.
He found before him a man of about forty, dressed in a short jacket, wearing a bowler hat, with a fine, affable face.
- Mr Florentin Cormier?
- Yes, that's right.
He ushered him into the dining room.
- The examining magistrate asks you to come to his chambers.
Madame Cormier came out of the kitchen to hear these words, and if Florentin, who was looking at her, hadn't made an energetic gesture, she would have given herself away; the words on her lips: "You've come to arrest my son!
- And can you tell me what case the examining magistrate has summoned me for?
- The Caffié case.
- And what time must I appear before the examining magistrate?
- At once.
- But my son hasn't had breakfast!" cried Madame Cormier. At least have something to eat before you go, my dear boy.
- There's no need.
He made a sign to her not to insist: his throat was too tight to swallow a piece of bread, and it was important not to betray his emotion in front of this agent.
- I'm all yours," he said.
Turning to his mother, he kissed her, but lightly, without effusiveness, as if he were only going out for a short absence.
- See you soon!
She was distraught, but realising that she was compromising her son if she gave in, she restrained herself.
XX
Since it was a role he was playing, Florentin told himself that he had to play it to the end to the best of his ability, by getting into the skin of the character he wanted to be, and that role was that of witness.
He had been Caffié's clerk; the law wanted to question him about his former boss, nothing could be more natural; it was that alone, and that alone, that he could accept; consequently, he had to take an interest in the police investigations, and be curious to find out where they stood.
This was the question he put to the constable as they walked side by side down the street:
- Are you making any progress on the Caffié case?
- I don't know anything about it," said the agent, who thought it prudent to keep a low profile, "and I don't know any more than what's in the papers.
On leaving his mother's house, Florentin had noticed a man on the opposite pavement who seemed to be in a station; after a few minutes, as they turned a corner, he saw that the man was following them at a certain distance: so it wasn't a simple appearance before the examining magistrate, because you don't take such precautions with a witness.
When they arrived at Place Clichy, the officer asked him if he wanted to get into the car, but he didn't accept. What was the point? It was an unnecessary expense.
Then he saw the policeman raise his hat as if greeting someone, but the greeting was certainly not addressed to anyone; and immediately the man who had been following them drew closer. This hat-trick was a signal: as they entered the crowd from the deserted districts of Batignolles, it was feared that he would try to escape; the character of the arrest became more pronounced.
After the forebodings and fears that had tormented him over the last few days, this was not surprising, but the fact that they were being lenient with him meant that everything had not yet been decided: he therefore had to defend himself as best he could. Panicked before the danger, he felt less weak now that he was in it.
On arriving at the Palais de Justice, he was immediately ushered into the examining magistrate's chambers. But the judge did not concern himself with him immediately: he was in the middle of questioning a woman; he continued, and Florentin was able to examine him surreptitiously: he was an elegant, comfortable-looking man, still young, who looked more like a boulevardier or a sportsman than a magistrate, with nothing solemn or imposing about him.
As he continued his questioning, he too was examining Florentin, but with a quick glance, without insisting, as if by chance, and simply because his eyes met his. In front of a table, a clerk was writing, and near the door two gendarmes were waiting with the bored and empty faces of people who are elsewhere.
Soon the examining magistrate looked up at them:
- You may take the accused away.
Then, turning to Florentin, he asked him for his surname, first names and address.
- You used to be a clerk for the business agent Caffié; why did you leave him?
- Because my work was too hard.
- Are you afraid of work?
- No, when it's not excessive; it was at Mr Caffié's and didn't leave me time to work for myself: I had to arrive at the office at eight in the morning, I had lunch there and didn't leave until seven to go and have dinner with my mother in Batignolles; I had an hour and a half for that; at half past eight I had to be back and I stayed until ten or ten thirty. In accepting this position I had thought that I would be able to complete my education, which had been interrupted by my father's death, go to law school, and become something better than a miserable businessman's clerk; this was not possible with Mr Caffié: I left him, and it was for this reason alone that we parted.
- Where did you go next?
This was the tricky question, the one that Florentin dreaded, because it could arouse prejudices against him that nothing would destroy; however, he could not fail to answer, because what he himself would not say others would reveal: an investigation on this point was too easy.
- At the home of another businessman, Mr Savoureux, in the rue de la Victoire, where I was not supposed to work in the evenings. I stayed there for about three months and then left for America.
- Why did you do that?
- Because, when I wanted to get down to serious work, I realised that my studies had been interrupted for too long for me to be able to resume them: I had forgotten a good deal of what I had learned badly; I would probably fail my baccalauréat, and I wouldn't be able to start my law studies until it was too late. I left France for America, where I hoped to find a good position.
- You came back to Paris.
- Three weeks ago.
- And you went to Caffié?
- Yes, I went.
- What did I do?
- Ask him for a certificate to replace the one he gave me that I lost.
- That was the day of the crime.
- Yes, it was.
- At what time?
- I arrived at his house at about two forty-five and left at about half past three.
- Did he give you the certificate you asked for?
- Yes, here it is.
And, taking it out of his pocket, he presented it to the examining magistrate: it was a certificate stating that, throughout the time that Mr Florentin Cormier had been his clerk, Caffié had had nothing but praise for him, for his work and for his accuracy and probity.
- And you didn't go back to his house that evening? asked the examining magistrate.
- Why would I have gone back? I'd got what I wanted.
- So did you or did you not go back?
- I didn't go back.
- Do you remember what you did when you left Caffié's?
If Florentin had had the slightest illusion about his appearance before the examining magistrate, the way his interrogation was conducted would have taken it away from him: he was not being questioned as a witness, he was being charged; he did not have to enlighten justice, he had to defend himself.
- Perfectly," he said; "it wasn't that long ago. On leaving the rue Sainte-Anne, as I had nothing to do, I went down to the quays and read from the Port Royal to the Institut; but just then a shower came down and I went back up to Les Batignolles where I stayed with my mother.
- What time was it when you arrived at your mother's house?
- Five o'clock and a few minutes.
- Can't you be more precise?
- Quarter past five, give or take a few minutes.
- And you didn't go out again?
- No, I did not.
- Did anyone come to your mother's house after you went in?
- Nobody; my sister came home at seven o'clock, as she always does when she comes back from her lesson.
- Before going up to your house, did you speak to any of the tenants?
- No, I didn't.
There was a pause and Florentin felt the judge's eyes fixed on him with a disturbing persistence: it seemed that this gaze, which enveloped him from head to toe, wanted to undress him.
- Another thing," said the examining magistrate; "you didn't lose a button on your trousers while you were at Caffié's, did you?
Florentin had been waiting for this question; and for a long time he had been considering the answer he would give. Denial was impossible. It would be too easy to convince him that he was lying, because the very fact that he was asked would mean that he had proof that the button belonged to him. So he had to confess the truth, however serious it might be.
- Yes," he said, "and this is how...
He recounted in detail the story of the file on the highest shelf of a locker; his near-fall; the removal of the button, which he had only noticed in the street.
The examining magistrate opened a drawer and took out a small box from which he took a button which he presented to Florentin.
- Is this it?" he asked.
Florentin looked at him.
- It's rather difficult to answer," he said at last; "one button looks like another.
- Not always.
- For that, I'd have to have noticed the shape of the one I lost, and I didn't pay any attention to it: it seems to me that no one knows exactly how and what the buttons on it are made of.
The examining magistrate looked at him again:
- But aren't the trousers you have on today the same as the one from which this button was torn off?
- It's the one I was wearing the day I went to see Mr Caffié.
- So it's quite simple to compare the button I'm showing you with those on your trousers, and your answer becomes easy.
It was impossible to escape this check.
- Unbutton your waistcoat," said the judge, "and make your comparison carefully, as carefully as you see fit: the question is important.
Florentin was only too aware of the importance of this question; but, as it was put to him, he could not but answer frankly.
He unbuttoned his waistcoat and compared the button he found with his own.
- I think this is the button I lost," he said.
Although he had tried hard not to betray his anguish, he felt that his voice was trembling and that it had a hoarse accent; then he wanted to explain this emotion:
- This is a truly terrible chance for me," he said.
The examining magistrate did not reply.
- But just because I lost a button at Mr Caffié's, it doesn't follow that the button was ripped off me in a struggle!
- You have your system, you'll put it forward: this is not the place to do so; I have only one question left to ask you: Which button did you replace the one you lost?
- Any button you could find.
- Who sewed it?
- I did.
- Are you in the habit of sewing on your own buttons?
Although the examining magistrate did not insist on this last question, either in tone or form, Florentin could see the accusation that his answer was going to make.
- Sometimes," he said.
- However, when you came home you found your mother, you told me. Did she have any reason for not being able to sew on the button herself?
- I didn't ask her to do it.
- But when she saw you sewing it on, didn't she take the needle out of your hand?
- She didn't see me.
- Why didn't she see you?
- She was busy preparing our dinner.
- That's enough.
- I was in the hallway of our flat, where they've made a bed for me since my return; my mother was in the kitchen.
- Don't the kitchen and the hall communicate?
- The door was closed.
A whole stream of words rose to his lips to protest against the conclusions that seemed to result from his answers, but he stopped; he saw himself caught in a cog, and all his efforts to free himself from it only embraced him more tightly.
Since he was no longer being questioned, the best thing, it seemed, was to say nothing; and he remained silent for quite a long time, the length of which he only vaguely appreciated: the judge spoke in a low voice, the clerk wrote quickly, and all he heard was a monotonous murmur that was torn apart by the squeaking of a quill on the paper.
- Your examination will be read to you," said the judge.
He wanted to devote all his attention to this reading, but he soon lost the thread: when the questions moved from one fact to another, he stayed with the one that had just been examined and arrived too late at the one that was being dealt with: the impression he got, however, was that what he had said had been faithfully reproduced or summarised; he signed.
- Now," said the examining magistrate, "my duty obliges me, in the presence of the charges that emerge from your interrogation, to issue a detention order against you.
Florentin received the blow without flinching.
- I know," he said, "that all the protests I would make would have no effect at the moment, so I'll spare you them; but I have a favour to ask of you... a grace: to allow me to announce my arrest to my mother and my sister... who love me dearly. Oh! you will read my letter.
- Do so, sir.
XXI
After the departure of her son and the agent, Madame Cormier had been devastated: her son! her Florentine! the poor child! and she had sunk into despair.
Hadn't they suffered enough! They needed this new ordeal! Why was life so mercilessly cruel to them?
One complaint after another had brought her back year after year to the death of her husband, the starting point of their misfortunes. What had been good since that day? After so many others, this latest blow was the hardest and crushed her. Ah, why hadn't Dr Saniel let her die? At least she wouldn't have seen this final catastrophe, this disgrace: her son accused of murder, in prison, at the assizes!
And she would repeat these complaints aloud, weeping, with the relief of a pain that has been abandoned: she was alone in her deserted home; there was no one to hear her, to look at her, to scold her.
For when she allowed herself to be overcome by grief, Philis always scolded her, tenderly it's true, with gentle words and caresses, but in the end she scolded her: a constant watch, not a minute's freedom when she was at home. If a sigh escaped her, if her lips twitched, if her eyes were clouded with sadness, Philis would immediately notice and, with a glance and a word: "Mummy", she would remind her not to let herself go.
And why shouldn't she? Philis was really unreasonable, wanting people never to complain about life and the unfairness of things. To resist, you need nerves that allow resistance, and she didn't have those strong nerves, poor woman that she was.
Now that she was alone, she could at least cry at her ease, and complain and moan.
She wept and she moaned, but there came a time when, after having gone to the extremes of despair that saw her son condemned as a murderer and executed, she stopped and wondered if she wasn't going too far. It was no longer Philis who was telling her that it was wrong to give up, it was herself.
Being called before the examining magistrate did not mean that Florentin should not return and that he would be lost, as her maternal panic had imagined.
Without knowing much about the ways of the law, she believed that one did not deal with people under arrest in the way that this officer had done: "Monsieur le juge d'instruction vous prie de passer à son cabinet" ("The examining magistrate asks you to come to his chambers"); these were not the manners of a policeman.
He was coming back; she could certainly wait for him.
And she had waited for him without wanting to have breakfast; the poor child would be happy, when he returned, not to sit down to dinner on his own. Besides, she was too deeply upset to be able to eat. She had carefully covered the coal in the stove with ashes to keep her mutton beans warm: it was her favourite dish, along with turnips, and she had found some excellent, tender, fresh turnips in the morning at the market; how hungry he would be!
Time had gone by, minutes, hours, and he hadn't arrived; other coals had had to be lit, covered too, and despite all these precautions the sauce had turned sour: what a bore!
And although Florentin had a lot to say about Caffié, and although no one thought to interrupt him when he was speaking, it was becoming more and more impossible to believe that something extraordinary had not happened. Had he been arrested? But then what would become of him?
She had fallen back into a fit of tears and despair, but this time she didn't feel any relief at being alone; on the contrary, she would have liked Philis to be there: with her one wouldn't lose one's head; she always knew how to get out of trouble; she found something to say; perhaps, after all, things weren't as serious as they seemed.
Fortunately, she wasn't going to be home late that day: all we had to do was wait for her and not despair until she arrived.
She waited, and over the years she had become so accustomed to relying on her daughter for everything, that she was almost reassured to think that she would arrive.
As quickly as she could, Madame Cormier went to open the door and was stunned to see her daughter's convulsed face: Philis had obviously been surprised by the sudden opening of the door.
- So you know everything," cried Madame Cormier.
Philis took her in her arms and led her into the dining room where she sat her down:
- Calm down," she said, "don't worry, we won't keep him.
- Do you have a way?
- We'll find a way; I promise you we won't keep him.
- Are you sure?
- I promise.
- You're giving me my life back. But how did you know?
- He wrote to me: as I was passing by, the concierge gave me his letter, which had just arrived.
- What did it say?
Madame Cormier took the letter Philis held out to her, but the paper shook so badly in her agitated hand that she couldn't read it.
- Read it to me.
Philis took it back and read:
"Dear little sister,
"After hearing me out, the examining magistrate is keeping me on. Soften the pain of this blow for Mum; make her understand that it's impossible not to recognise the falsity of this accusation soon, and on your side, do your utmost to make this falsity obvious, while on mine, I'm going to work to prove my innocence.
"Give my love to your poor mother and find consolation for her in your tenderness, your strength and your kindness; mine will be to think that you are close to her, dear beloved little sister.
"FLORENTIN".
- And it is this brave boy who is accused of murder!" cried Madame Cormier, bursting into tears.
It took Philis several minutes to calm this crisis down a little.
- It's him you have to think about, Mum; let's not give up.
- You're going to do something, aren't you, my little Philis?
- I'm going to find Mr Saniel.
- Mr Saniel is a doctor, not a lawyer.
- It's precisely as a doctor that M. Saniel can save Florentin. He knows that Caffié was killed without a struggle between him and his killer, and therefore without the button being torn off. Let him say so, let him prove it to the examining magistrate and Florentin's innocence will be proven. I'm going to his place.
- Please don't leave me alone for too long.
- I'll be right back.
Philis ran down from Les Batignolles to the rue Louis-le-Grand. When she rang the doorbell, Joseph, who had taken his place in the antechamber, opened it quickly and, as Saniel had no one with her, she went straight into his study.
- What's the matter?" he asked, seeing her agitation.
- My brother's been arrested.
- Ah, the poor boy.
What Saniel had said to Philis to explain that this arrest could not take place was sincere, he believed it, and even did more than believe it, he wanted it. When he had decided to kill Caffié, he had not believed that justice could ever find someone guilty: it would be a crime that would go unpunished, like so many others, and no one would be bothered. But now one had been arrested, and the culprit was the brother of the woman he loved. He was taken aback for a moment.
- How was he arrested?" he asked, as much to find out as to recover.
She told him what she knew and read Florentin's letter.
- Your brother's a good boy," he said, as if talking to himself.
- You're going to save him.
- How can I do that?
It was a cry that escaped her without her understanding its meaning, without her guessing the expression of worried curiosity in the gaze he had fixed on her.
- Who do you want me to talk to if not you? Aren't you everything to me! My support, my guidance, my advice, my God!
She explained what she wanted from him.
Once again, an exclamation escaped Saniel:
- You want me to go to the examining magistrate!
- Who better than you to explain how things happened?
Saniel, who had recovered from his initial surprise, didn't flinch; obviously she was speaking in complete good faith, without suspecting anything, and it would be madness to look for anything other than what she was saying.
- But that's not how you present yourself to an examining magistrate," he replied.
- Why don't you go and meet his summons, since you know things that could enlighten him?
- Is it really wise to anticipate this summons? By going to see him, I am defending your brother...
- That is precisely what I am asking you.
- ... And, by the very fact that I am presenting myself as your defender, I am taking away the weight of my testimony, which would have more authority if it were that of a simple witness.
- But when will you be asked for this statement? Think of Florentin's suffering during this waiting period, of Mum's suffering, of my suffering. He could lose his mind. He could kill himself. His soul isn't strong, and Mum's isn't very strong either. Will she be able to withstand everything the newspapers are going to publish? There's that unfortunate past that we'll be reminded of and that will bring shame on us.
Saniel hesitated for a moment.
- Well, I'll go," he said, "not this evening, it's too late, but tomorrow morning.
- Oh, dear Victor," she cried, hugging him, "I knew you would save him: we owe you his life, as we already owe you our mother's, as I owe you my happiness; am I not right to say that you are my God?
When she had left to return to her mother as soon as possible, he had a moment of self-reflection that made him regret his weakness; for it was indeed a weakness, a silly sentimentality, unworthy of a strong man who would not have allowed himself to be touched and drawn away in this way. What need was there for him to go and provoke danger when he could remain quite calm, without anyone thinking about him? Was this not madness? Justice wanted a culprit; public curiosity needed one: why take away the one they had? If he succeeded, wouldn't they look for another? That was imprudence and, to put it bluntly, insanity. Now that he was no longer under the influence of Philis's beautiful grieving eyes, he was not going to commit this imprudence. Throughout the evening he consolidated this idea, and when he went to bed his mind was made up: he would not go to the examining magistrate.
But when he woke up he was surprised to find that the resolution of the evening was no longer the resolution of the morning, and that this dualism of personality which had already struck him was asserting itself once again: it was at night that he had resolved to kill Caffié and in the evening that he had carried it out; it was in the morning that he had abandoned the idea, just as it was in the morning that he was going back on the decision he had taken the day before not to go to the poor boy's aid. What on earth was the will of man, undulating like the sea and variable like the wind, that he had been foolish enough to believe was so firm at home?
At midday, he arrived at the Palais de Justice and handed the examining magistrate his card, on which he had simply written three words: "For the Caffié case".
Almost immediately he was received, and he briefly explained how, in his opinion, Caffié had been killed in a quick and lightning death, by a firm yet intelligent hand, that of a professional killer.
- That's the conclusion of your report," said the examining magistrate.
- What I couldn't say in my report, because I wasn't aware of the button's discovery and the conclusions it led to, was that there was no struggle, as is supposed, between the killer and his victim.
And he demonstrated medically how this struggle had been impossible.
The examining magistrate listened attentively, without a word, without a gesture of interruption.
- Do you know this young man?
- I've only seen him once, but I know his mother, whom I looked after, and it was at her instigation that I decided to present these observations to you.
- No doubt they have their value, but I would point out that they tend to do nothing less than destroy our hypothesis.
- If it is unfounded!
- I would point out to you that you are negative, Doctor, not suggestive. We have a culprit and you have none. Do you see one?
Saniel thought he realised that the examining magistrate was looking at him with worrying persistence:
- No," he said briskly.
Then, having risen, he added more calmly:
- That's not my role.
All he had to do was withdraw, which he did, and as he followed the long, sonorous hallway he told himself that the magistrate was right: he had a guilty man, he believed; why would he let him go?
As far as he was concerned, he had done what he could.
Part Two
I
Saniel had passed the first tests of his two competitions so brilliantly that the results were not in doubt for either of them. In defending his thesis for the agrégation, he had forced his audience to admire him: by turns aggressive, snarling, ironic and eloquent, he had so effectively reduced his opponent to the brink that the latter, crushed in the end, had been unable to reply. In his hour-long lecture on death in heart disease, he had displayed such clarity of demonstration, such beautiful sobriety of speech, such firm, simple, confident scientific eloquence, that his most unfair opponents had had to recognise that he possessed the qualities of the great teachers: a brute but someone. He had also been brutal in the tests for the hospital competitive examination: as his diagnosis was opposed to that of his judges, he had been unsparing, without compliments, simply for the love of truth, and he had accumulated so much strong evidence in support of his opinion, such tight logic, such compelling argumentation, that the jury had decided to return to the patient's bed, and that after a new examination, in which he had acknowledged his error, the president had said to him: "When I am ill, it is you who will look after me".
What did Caffié's death weigh in the balance? So little, in fact, that it didn't count at all and would have been of no concern to him, had it not been for the fact that it was involved in the prosecution that was going to put Florentin on trial.
With this fact out of the way, the old businessman's death rarely passed through his mind: he had something else in mind, really, than this memory, which was imposed neither by regret nor by remorse, and it was not at the moment when he was nearing his goal that he was going, with Caffié, to embarrass or sadden his triumph.
A little before the two-month period during which the poste restante keeps the letters was about to expire, he had gone to claim those containing the thirty thousand francs from the various offices to which he had addressed them, and, putting the notes back in new envelopes, he had sent them out as he had done the first time, but starting with the offices last listed on his almanac, and then he had thought no more about it.
What did he need with this money which, in reality, was a hindrance to him? Since he had it, his habits had remained the same, except that he no longer fought his creditors. He would have considered himself a coward and a wretch if he had used it to give himself a sense of well-being which poverty had hitherto deprived him of, and the idea had not even occurred to him. As in the days of distress, he continued to have lunch with the portion of plain beef or fricandeau au jus that Joseph would fetch for him from the corner greengrocer's, and the only change to the tradition was that now you paid in cash and by force, because the greengrocer, who demanded money when you didn't offer him any, no longer wanted any since we no longer asked for credit: "We'll put it on the bill. And what he did for the material things in life was repeated for everything; not out of prudence, not so as not to attract attention, but simply because for him there was no desire or need to change anything that had been done in the past: his ambition was elsewhere and higher than in the small satisfactions, very small for him, that money can give.
Had he not had to worry about Florentin, he would certainly have spent whole days, perhaps even series of days, without giving a thought to Caffié; but Florentin and especially Philis reminded him that the tranquillity he now enjoyed was due to Caffié's death, and it was relatively disturbed by it.
He did not believe that the law would now come looking for him: everything came together to confirm his security. What he had so painstakingly arranged would have succeeded, and the only imprudence that a moment of aberration had caused him to commit did not seem to have been noticed; no one had reported his presence at the café opposite Caffié's house, and no one had been surprised by his persistence in staying there at such a characteristic hour.
But it was not enough for him to be safe from these searches; he had to prevent Florentin from being unjustly condemned for a crime of which he was innocent: It was bad enough that the poor boy was imprisoned and that his sister was in despair, his mother sick with grief; but for him to be sent to the scaffold or to prison would be too much; in itself, Caffié's death would be of little consequence: it would become atrocious if it led to such an outcome. 
He could not, he did not want that to happen, and he had to do everything he could, not only to prevent the sentence from being passed, but also to prevent the prison sentence from being prolonged.
It was to this feeling that he had obeyed when he went to explain to the examining magistrate that the charges against Florentin resulting from the discovery of the button were groundless, since there had been no struggle; but the way in which his intervention had been received, by showing him that justice was not prepared to allow his hypothesis to be disturbed by a simple medical demonstration, had thrown him into disquiet and perplexity.
Undoubtedly, someone else in his place would have let things continue as they were and, since justice had a culprit with whom it was satisfied, would have done nothing to take him away; while it followed its hypothesis to prove the guilt of the one it had, it did not look elsewhere; when it had him convicted, all would be over; the Caffié affair was buried, just as Caffié himself was buried; silence came with oblivion and security for him. The crime had been punished, the satisfied public conscience demanded nothing more, not even to know if the debt had been paid by the person who really owed it. But he was not that other person, and if he thought the old rascal's death was legitimate, it was on condition that Florentin, who had benefited nothing from it, was not made to pay.
Florentin therefore had to be released as soon as possible, and it was his duty to do so, his imperative duty, -- not only to Philis, but also to himself.
As the case had developed after the approach to the examining magistrate, he had understood and had made Philis understand, distraught, that until the day Florentin appeared before the jury, he could do little or nothing directly. On that day, it's true, he would regain his authority and, speaking in the name of science, he would prove to the jurors that the story of the button was an invention of desperate policemen that couldn't stand up to scrutiny: but until then, the poor boy remained at Mazas, and, however sure we might be of an acquittal at that moment, it would be better to have the case dismissed immediately, if we could obtain it.
For that, the intervention and direction of a doctor were of little use; what was needed was that of a lawyer.
But which one? Philis would have liked them to go to the most illustrious, the one who, by his talent, authority and success, was bound to win all her cases. But he had told her that these miracle-workers probably didn't exist at the bar any more than in medicine, where you couldn't call a doctor who didn't lose patients, and that, if he did exist, neither he nor she had the large sum of money to pay him. In truth, he would have gladly given up the thirty thousand francs that the post office was keeping, or a large part of that sum, so that Florentin could be set free; but, apart from the fact that it would have been imprudent to take the notes out of their hiding place at this moment, he could not admit that he had thirty thousand francs or even ten thousand: how would he have obtained them? From the most illustrious of lawyers, they had therefore had to go down to a modest one, and as Saniel did not recognise any competence in making this choice, he had decided with Philis to consult Brigard, who, better than anyone else, having made a whole army of lawyers over the last thirty years, was qualified to find and indicate a good one.
As usual, he had been received affectionately by Crozat, who had scolded him for making himself so scarce, and, as usual too, so as not to disturb the discussion by making a noisy entrance, he had remained standing by the door: when the meeting was over, he would talk to Brigard alone.
That evening, it was a phrase from Chateaubriand that served as the theme for the speeches: "The tiger kills and sleeps; man kills and watches", and as he listened to the developments to which it lent itself, Saniel said to himself that it was a real pity not to be able to respond to all this rhetoric with a simple fact of personal experience: never had he slept so well, so peacefully, as since, with the death of Caffié, he had rid himself of all the worries that in recent months had so tormented and shortened his sleep. Glady had particularly distinguished himself and, from the shock of this antithesis, he had conjured up images that had been warmly applauded or underlined by small cries of admiration from which Brigard gave the signal. Through the smoke, Saniel had looked for Nougarède, to see what effect his rival's success was having on him, but he hadn't found him.
In the end, Brigard summed up the discussion by observing that nothing better proved the power of human conscience than this difference between man and beast; then, after the jugs of beer had been emptied, everyone withdrew, Glady first, the fear of having to endure another assault from Saniel taking precedence over the joy of tasting his triumph and that of escaping a loan.
So Saniel, left alone with Brigard and Crozat, made his request.
- But it's the Caffié affair?
- Precisely.
And at length he explained his interest in Florentin, the son of one of his clients, and the situation of this client.
- Well, my dear, my advice to you is to entrust the case to Nougarède. You might say to me: Nougarède is this and that. Anything you say, if your objections go back two years; at the time, I agree, they were well-founded: a little hollow and empty, it's true. But since then he has come into his own; his words have lost none of their catchy charm, and his mind has grown stronger; he has gained in breadth as well as depth; in short, in my opinion, he is the man you need. I heard him in his last two cases at the assizes; with his southern loquaciousness, his seductive and cuddly manner, the sympathy he inspires at first sight, the warmth, the emotion, the tenderness he uses without abusing it, he won over the jury. No doubt he is not a master; but can your client afford a master, and would this master, busy with fifty important cases, give himself to yours as Nougarède will? Not to mention the fact that Nougarède will be influenced by you and me, and that he will try to get the case dismissed if possible, which will be better than an acquittal.
Crozat agreed, recommending that he go and see Nougarède the next day:
- In the morning, right? because after the Palace Nougarède is all tied up with his marriage, which, as you can see, has prevented him from coming this evening.
- What do you mean? Nougarède is getting married?" cried Saniel, surprised that his favourite disciple should give such a denial of his master's teachings and examples.
- My God, yes; you mustn't hold it against him too much. He suffers the fatalities of a special environment. Unbeknownst to us, Nougarède, it can now be said and even should be said, was the happy lover of a charming young woman, the daughter of one of our most graceful genre actresses and brought up in a fashionable convent; you can see the situation. From this affair was born a child, a delicious little boy. It seemed quite natural, didn't it, that they should live as husband and wife, since they loved each other, and not weaken by legal ties the strength of those that bound them to this child. But there was the mother, an actress as I told you, who in this capacity, because of her past and her background, wanted her daughter to receive all the sacraments that the law and the Church can confer. She manoeuvred so well that poor Nougarède gave in; he went to the town hall, he went to church, he legitimised the child, and even accepted a dowry of two hundred thousand francs. I pity him, the unfortunate man; but I confess that I have the weakness not to condemn him as he would have deserved if he had married in an honest environment.
Saniel had been a little surprised by these similarities with the charming young woman Caffié had proposed to him. The daughter of one of our most graceful genre comediennes, brought up in a fashionable convent, mother of a delicious little boy, endowed with two hundred thousand francs: it was a curious meeting, to say the least; but, if it was a question of one and the same woman, he was not angry to see that Nougarède had been less difficult than he had been.
II
On his way to Nougarède's, Saniel vaguely imagined that the lawyer would tell him that an acquittal was certain if Florentin went to trial, and even that a dismissal was likely. But his hopes had not been fulfilled.
- The adventure with the button wouldn't have happened to you or me in the same serious way as it did to this boy; we don't have any priors on which to base presumptions, but he does: the forty-five francs that constitute embezzlement by a hired man will certainly be the starting point for the prosecution; it starts with a weakness, ends with a crime. He begins with the portrait of the clerk of yesteryear, hard-working, exact, scrupulous, content with little and finding satisfaction in duty done; then, in contrast, he moves on to the clerk of today: as irregular in his work as in his conduct, consumed by needs, in a hurry to enjoy himself, dissatisfied with everything and everyone, with others as well as with himself. "What more striking example could there be than the one you have before you today, gentlemen of the jury? Here he is, the irregular of whom I spoke; with no special education, he has the unexpected good fortune to find an honourable position; but he has to work and work bothers him, above all because it prevents him from enjoying himself; what he wants are the pleasures of worldly life, that of the happy people of this world whom he envies. He leaves his situation for another that will give him the freedom to satisfy his appetites. What does he do with this freedom? He indulges in debauchery and immerses himself in the disorderly existence he wanted. Dangerous sirens lure him, charm him, fascinate him, and he is lost. They too are consumed by the need for luxury. Where would he find the money they demanded of him, and which his passion did not have the strength to refuse? In his boss's till. He starts by embezzling forty-five francs and ends up stealing thirty-five thousand after a murder." You can be sure that, if the case goes to trial, as I believe it will, you will hear these words, or at least this theme, and I assure you that we will have difficulty destroying the impression it will have made on the jurors; but we will get there... I hope.
We had had to give up on the dismissal and tell ourselves that the case would go to trial; but the fact that you are accused does not mean that you will be convicted, and Saniel had persisted in his belief that Florentin could not be convicted: Certainly preventive prison was hard on the poor boy, and appearing before the jury, with all the ignominy that goes with it, would be even harder; but in the end all that would disappear in the joy of acquittal: at that moment some ingenious idea, some sympathy, some effective support, would be found to pay him for what he had suffered. Things would certainly turn out that way, and the acquittal would be won hands down.
He had said it to himself over and over again, and from the day he had handed the case over to Nougarède, he had often gone to see Nougarède to hear it repeated.
- Isn't it true that he can't be convicted?
- You can always be convicted, even if you're innocent, just as you can always die, as you know, even if you're in excellent health.
Nougarède, clever as he was, exaggerated the possible danger in order to increase his importance and, ultimately, his success.
During one of these visits, he had met Madame Nougarède, who had been married for a few days, and, recognising in her the young virgin with the child whose portrait Caffié had shown him, he had been strengthened in his idea that conscience, as we understand it, was decidedly a singular weighing instrument, which could be made to say whatever we wanted: what was the point of all this hypocrisy and who did we think we were fooling?
Although he had always told Philis that the acquittal was certain, and had promised to look after Florentin, which he had in fact done, she had not completely entrusted either him or Nougarède with the task of defending her brother, and with them she had worked on this defence.
What had delayed the referral to the assizes, Nougarède believed, were the investigations into whether, during his stay in America, Florentin had not worked in some large meat factory, some sheepfold, some herdsman's shop, where he had learned to use the knife used by cattle cutters, which was the key point for the prosecution. To ward off this danger, Philis, for her part, had written to the various towns where Florentin had stayed, to prove that during his two-year stay his time had been used in such a way that he had not been able to complete this apprenticeship: it is true that he had worked in La Plata for six months as an accountant in the offices of a large sheepfold in Bahia-Blanca; but the fact that he had kept the books in a sheepfold did not mean that he had ever cut the sheep's throats.
When she received a letter, she took it straight to Saniel, and then to Nougarède; and at the same time, all over Paris, among those who had had dealings with her brother, she was looking for evidence to prove to the jury that he could not be the man the prosecution believed him to be. So it was that, on her own, with no means of action other than those she found in her fraternal tenderness and her valour, she had organised an investigation parallel to that of the courts, which, on the day of judgement, would carry some weight, it seemed, on the jury's conviction, by showing it what the real life of this irregular and debauched man, capable of anything to satisfy his appetite and his needs, had been.
Whenever she had obtained a favourable deposition, she would run to Saniel to tell him about it, and then in duet they would repeat to each other that a conviction was impossible.
- You think so, don't you?
- Haven't I always said so?
He had also said that Florentin could not be arrested on the basis of the accusation that the button had been ripped off; he had also said that the examining magistrate would certainly dismiss the case; but neither of them wanted to remember that.
Things had reached that point when, one Saturday evening, Saniel saw Philis arrive home radiant.
At the door, she exclaimed:
- He's safe!
- Dismissed?
- No, but now it doesn't matter; we can go to trial.
She heaved a sigh that showed just how great her fears were, despite the confidence she had in herself when she repeated that a conviction was impossible.
He had left the desk in front of which he was working and, coming over to her, had taken her in his arm to make her sit next to him on the sofa:
- You'll see that I don't let myself be taken away by illusion and that, as I'm telling you, he's saved, well saved. Did you know that an illustrated newspaper published his portrait?
- I don't read illustrated newspapers.
- You could have seen it on the newsstands where it's displayed; that's where I saw it yesterday morning, as I was leaving, and I was petrified, red with shame, distraught, not knowing where to hide: "Florentin Cormier, the murderer of the Rue Sainte-Anne. Isn't it infamous that an innocent man can be dishonoured in this way? That's what I said to myself as I lowered my eyes in front of the newsagents I came across on my way home, unaware of the joy the publication of this portrait would bring me. Where did the newspaper get the photograph from which the engraving was made? Someone had come to ask us for one, but you can imagine how I welcomed the person who presented himself, not imagining that anything good could come of what I considered a disgrace.
- And what did?
- Proof that it wasn't Florentin who was at Caffié's when the murder was committed. All day yesterday and all morning today, I had remained under the impression of shame that pursued me, when at three o'clock I received this little note from the concierge in the Rue Sainte-Anne.
She took out of her pocket a piece of paper folded into the shape of a letter, with a crudely written address, which she handed to Saniel.
"Mademoiselle,
"If you would like to come to Rue Sainte-Anne, I have something to tell you which I think will please you very much.
"I am your servant.
"Widow ANAÏS BOUCHU."
- You know that the old concierge with the ankylosed kidneys never wanted to admit that my brother could be guilty. Florentin had been polite and kind to her during his stay at Caffié's, and she remained grateful to him. She had often told me that she was certain the culprit would be found, that the cards said so, and that when that happened she would ask me to warn her. Instead of me having to bring her this good news, it was she, as you can see, who wrote to me to come and receive it from her. You can imagine how quickly I came down from Les Batignolles to the rue Sainte-Anne. However far my imagination went, it remained below reality: I was counting on some favourable clue, a discovery, a testimony, not on proof; and this proof we have. When I arrived, the old woman took both my hands and told me she was going to take me straight to a lady who had seen Caffié's killer.
- Seen!" exclaimed Saniel, struck by a blow that shook him from head to toe.
- Perfectly seen, as I see you. She added that this lady was the owner of the house and that she lived in the second part of the building, on the second floor overlooking the courtyard, just opposite Caffié's study. This lady, called Madame Dammauville, the widow of a solicitor, is paralysed and hasn't left her room for a year, I think. This is what the concierge explained to me as we crossed the courtyard and climbed the stairs, always repeating: "Your troubles are over, my poor lady", but without telling me how or why. When I pressed her, she replied: "Wait a little longer, Madame will explain it to you better than I can, and she doesn't like people chattering.
If she had been able to observe Saniel, she would have seen him turn so pale that his lips were as white as his cheeks; but she was absorbed in what she was saying.
- A maid took us to Madame Dammauville's house, where I found her lying on a small bed by a window, and the concierge told her who I was. She greeted me affably and, after making me sit opposite her, told me that, having heard from her concierge that I was busy gathering evidence in my brother's favour, she had one to give me which would show that Caffié's murderer was not the man the law had arrested and was holding in custody. On the evening of Caffié's murder, she was in that same room, lying on that same bed, in front of that same window, and, after reading all day, she was thinking and dreaming about her book, looking vaguely out into the courtyard at the evening that was descending and already blurring everything in its shadow. All of a sudden, she saw a tall man, whom she took to be an upholsterer, approach the window and try to move the curtains; he didn't succeed, so Caffié got up and, taking the lamp, shone it in such a way that the light fell right on the upholsterer's face. You understand, don't you?
- Yes," murmured Saniel.
- She saw him very clearly, enough not to forget him and mistake him for someone else: tall, long hair, curly blond beard; the clothes were those of a gentleman, not a poor devil. The curtains were drawn; it was now a quarter past five or twenty minutes past five; and it was at this very moment that Caffié's throat was slit by this false upholsterer who had obviously drawn the curtains only to kill Caffié in complete safety, without being seen, not imagining that, precisely, he had just been seen carrying out a deed that denounced him as the assassin as surely as if he had been caught with a knife in his hand. When she read Florentin's description in the newspapers when he was arrested, Madame Dammauville had thought that the law had found the culprit: tall, with long hair and a curly beard, there were indeed points of resemblance; but in the portrait published in the illustrated newspaper she received, she did not recognise the man who had operated the curtains, and she was certain that the law was mistaken! You can see that Florentin is saved.
III
As he made no reply to this cry of triumph, she looked at him in surprise.
She saw that he was pale, his face shaken, obviously the result of a violent emotion that she could not explain.
- What's the matter?" she asked worriedly.
- Nothing!" he replied brutally.
- You don't want to weaken my hope, do you?" she said, not imagining that he could not be thinking of that hope and of Florentin.
In his confusion, she was opening a path for him: by following it, he would have time to recognise himself.
- It's true," he said.
- Don't you think that what Madame Dammauville saw proves Florentin's innocence?
- What may be proof for Madame Dammauville, for you, for me, will it be proof for the law?
- However...
- I saw you so full of joy that I didn't dare interrupt you.
- So you think this testimony is worthless," she murmured, overwhelmed.
- I'm not saying that. You have to think things over, weigh up the pros and cons, consider the situation from different points of view - which is what I'm trying to do.
- Say that it crushes me; I had let myself be taken away so well.
- You mustn't be crushed, any more than you must be stolen away. Certainly, what this lady has just told you is a considerable fact...
- Is it not?
- Undoubtedly; but, if the testimony she has given can have far-reaching consequences, it is on condition that the witness is trustworthy.
- Do you think this lady could have invented such a story?
- I'm not saying that; but first of all you have to know who she is.
- A solicitor's widow.
- A solicitor's widow, a landowner: obviously, that constitutes a social condition that merits consideration for justice; but what is her moral condition? You say she's paralysed?
- For more than a year.
- What paralysis? That's a very vague word for the rest of us; there are paralyses that disturb vision, and there are those that disturb reason. Is this lady suffering from one of these paralyses? Or is it another which enabled her to really see, on the evening of the murder, what she is saying, and which now leaves her mental faculties in a healthy state? That, above all, is what it would be important to know.
Philis was devastated.
- I hadn't thought of all that," she murmured.
- It's quite natural that you didn't think about it, but I'm a doctor, and while you were talking, it was the doctor who was listening to you.
- It's true, it's true!" she repeated, overwhelmed; "I only saw Florentin.
- If I were in your place, I would have seen only my brother, as you did, and let myself be carried away by hope; but I'm not in your place: it's through your voice that this woman speaks, whom I don't know and against whom I must be on my guard by the very fact that it's a paralytic who's giving this account.
She couldn't hold back the tears that had welled up in her eyes, and silently let them flow, unable to think of anything to say in reply.
- I'm sorry to upset you," he said.
- All I could see was Florentin's freedom.
- I'm not saying that Madame Dammauville's testimony won't have an influence on the courts, and especially on the jury; but I must warn you that you would be exposing yourself to a terrible disappointment if you believed that, simply because she says that the portrait published in an illustrated newspaper is not that of the man she saw or thought she saw, at a quarter past five in Caffié's study, your brother will be set free. There are witnesses who, with the best faith in the world, believe they have seen the most extraordinary things that have never existed except in their imagination; and there are people who accuse themselves rather than have nothing to say.
He piled words on top of words, as if, by trying to convince Philis, he could hope to convince himself; but, when the noise of his words died down, he was forced to admit to himself that, whatever this woman's paralysis might have been, on this occasion it had produced neither a disturbance of vision nor a disturbance of reason: She had seen him, seen him well, the tall man with the long hair, the curly beard, dressed like a gentleman, who was not a Florentine; when she told the story of the lamp and the drawstrings, she knew what she was saying; all her explanations could therefore only have an effect on Philis, and they would stop with her. 
It's true that this was something, because in his first fit of confusion he had come very close to betraying himself. But everything had happened so quickly that he had never imagined that, precisely at the moment when Caffié raised the lamp to illuminate him, there was a woman opposite to look at him and see him so well that she would not have forgotten him. He had thought he had taken every precaution by closing the curtains, when on the contrary he would have done better to leave them open: No doubt the solicitor's widow would have witnessed part of the scene, but in the shadows she would not have been able to make out his features as she had been able to do when he was himself in a good position, against the window, under the light; and before she had recovered from her surprise, before she had called out, before they had reached her voice, before they had descended the two flights of stairs, he would have had time to reach the street. But this idea had not occurred to him and, in order to protect himself from an immediate danger, he had thrown himself into another which, although uncertain in its timing, was no less serious.
Little by little Philis had found herself again, and the hope that Madame Dammauville had put in her heart, crushed for a moment by Saniel's observations, had risen again.
- Is it not possible that Madame Dammauville really saw what she says she did?
- Without a doubt, and there's even a good chance that she did, since the man who drew the curtains wasn't your brother, we know that; unfortunately we're not the ones who need convincing, since our conviction is already in place; it's those who also have a conviction that they won't give up unless it's taken away from them by force.
- But did Madame Dammauville see correctly?
- What we need to know above all is whether she is in a fit state to see well; that's all I said.
- Surely a doctor would know by examining her?
- Without a doubt.
- What if you were that doctor?
- What if I were?
It was a cry rather than an exclamation: she wanted him to appear before this woman; but then she would recognise him!
Once again, at the risk of betraying his emotion, he had to go back on that first movement.
- But how do you expect me to examine this woman I don't know and who doesn't know me? You know very well that it's patients who choose their doctors, not doctors who choose their patients.
- If she called you!
- In what capacity?
- Without you seeing her, from what I would learn by making the concierge talk, couldn't you recognise her kind of paralysis?
- It would only be a very vague approximation: however, I urge you to make this enquiry and to extend it as far as you can; try to learn, not only everything about her illness, but also everything about her: what is her situation, what are her relations, this is important for a witness who imposes himself as much by what he is as by what he says: you understand that a deposition which destroys the whole system of the prosecution will be severely discussed, and that it will only be accepted if Madame Dammauville has, by her character and position, sufficient authority to break down resistance. 
- I'll also try to find out who her doctor is; perhaps you know him. What he would tell you would be better than anything I could tell you.
- We'd know right away about the paralysis, and we'd see how much credence we can give to this woman's words.
While listening to Philis and speaking himself, he had had time to consider the situation created by this thunderbolt: obviously, the first thing to do was to prevent suspicion from arising in Philis's mind, and that was what he had done by throwing himself into explanations of the various types of paralysis: he knew her well enough to see that he had succeeded. If at first she had been surprised by his excitement, she now found sufficient reason for him to worry about it later only in the event of direct accusations being made against him and causing her to backtrack. But he couldn't stop there; he needed more. What was she going to do now? How did she intend to use Madame Dammauville's statement? Had she spoken to anyone about it before? Was she going to tell Nougarède what she had just learned? All this had to be clarified. And as far as possible, she had to do nothing that he did not know about and approve of in advance. The circumstances were critical enough for him not to leave it to chance to direct them and lead them blindly.
- When did you see Madame Dammauville?
- Just now.
- And now, what do you want to do?
- I thought I should warn Mr Nougarède.
- Obviously, whatever the value of Madame Dammauville's statement, he must know it: it's up to him to judge; but as it's good to explain to him what could vitiate this statement, I'll go and see him if you like?
- I certainly want to and I thank you for it.
- In the meantime, go back to your mother and tell her what you've learned; but, so that she doesn't get her hopes up too much, tell her also that if there are chances, and big ones, in your brother's favour, on the other hand, there are some against. Tomorrow or this evening you will return to Rue Sainte-Anne and begin your enquiries with the concierge; if the old woman tells you nothing of interest, you will return to Madame Dammauville, whom you will ask to see on some pretext whatsoever: you will make her speak by listening carefully to the rhythm of her voice, you will note whether her ideas are connected, you will examine her face and her eyes; in short, you will leave no stone unturned. Having looked after your mother, you know the symptoms of myelitis almost as well as a doctor, and you'll be able to see straight away if there are similar symptoms in Madame Dammauville.
- If I dared!" she said timidly after a brief hesitation.
- What would you do?
- I'd ask you to come with me to the concierge's house straight away.
- Are you thinking about it?
Since the evening he had witnessed Caffié's death, he had never returned to the Rue Sainte-Anne, and it was not when the description given by Madame Dammauville was already circulating in the neighbourhood that he was going to commit the imprudence of showing himself.
But this exclamation had to be explained.
- How do you expect a doctor to carry out such an investigation? On your part, it's perfectly natural. From me, it would be inappropriate and ridiculous; add that it would be dangerous: you need to win the good graces of this Madame Dammauville; and it would really be going about it very badly to give her a pretext for believing that you're trying to find out whether she's sane or not.
- That's true," she said. I hadn't thought about that. I was thinking that, while I can only listen to what the concierge wants to tell me, you would know how to question her in a useful way to get her to say what it's in your interest to learn.
- In the meantime, go back to the concierge this evening, question her; if possible, go up to Madame Dammauville's, and don't return to your mother's until you've obtained some information about what we have so much interest in learning. I, for my part, am going to Nougarède's.
IV
It was not in order to falsify Philis' story that Saniel had insisted on seeing Nougarède: why bother? It would be a blunder that would sooner or later reveal itself and turn against him; he would have wanted, with the authority of a doctor, to explain that the testimony of a paralytic could have no more importance than that of a madwoman.
But at the first words of his explanation, Nougarède stopped him:
- What you are saying is very possible, my dear friend; but I would point out that it is not for us to raise objections of this kind. This is testimony that can save our client: let's accept it as it is and wherever it comes from. It is up to the prosecution to prove that our witness could not have seen what he says he saw, or that his mental state does not allow him to know what he is saying. And, rest assured, there will be no shortage of investigations. So let's not awaken this side ourselves; that would be naive.
This was certainly not what Saniel had wanted; he had simply thought it his duty, as a doctor, to point out the pitfalls that could be encountered.
- Our duty," continued the lawyer, "is to manoeuvre in such a way as to avoid them, and this is how I would understand the role of this truly providential witness, if it is still possible to make him take it. Since it has occurred to you, who wish to see this poor boy acquitted, that Madame Dammauville's testimony could be tainted by the very fact that it came from a sick woman, it is incontestable, is it not, that this same idea will occur to those who wish to see a conviction. This testimony would be irrefutable, it would impose itself in such a way that no reproach could be raised against it, that it would remove the acquittal at whatever moment it occurred: it was from a quarter past five to half past five that Caffié was murdered: at just a quarter past five, a woman respectable for her position, and whose intellectual as well as physical faculties make her worthy of all belief, would have seen in Caffié's study a man, whom it is materially impossible to confuse with Florentin Cormier, draw the curtains of the window and thus prepare for the crime; she would make her statement under these conditions and in these terms, and the case would be over: there would be no examining magistrate, after the confrontation, to send Florentin Cormier before the assizes, and if there were one, there would certainly not be two votes in the jury for conviction. But that's not how things are and won't be. Her husband was an esteemed solicitor, and one of his brothers was a notary in Paris.
- Did you ever have any dealings with her?
- Never; I'm telling you what is common knowledge in the business world. So morally she's beyond reproach. But physically, intellectually, is she the same? Not at all, unfortunately. She is a woman suffering from an illness that often leaves neither her mind nor her senses intact; her eyesight can be affected by aberrations, her mind by hallucinations. So we can argue about what she says, and if there is a doctor who affirms that her paralysis does not give rise to these aberrations or hallucinations, there will be another who will contest these assertions and come to a radically opposite conclusion. So much for the witness himself; now let's move on to the testimony. This testimony does not say that the man who drew the curtains at a quarter past five was made in such a way that it is materially impossible to confuse him with Florentin Cormier, because he was short, or hunchbacked, or bald, or dressed like a prowler at the gate, whereas Florentin is tall, straight, hairy, bearded and dressed like a gentleman; He simply says that the man who drew the curtains was tall, with long hair, a curly blond beard, and dressed like a gentleman. But this description is precisely that of Florentin Cormier, just as it is yours...
- Mine!" exclaimed Saniel.
- Yours, like that of many people. And that, unfortunately for us, is what deprives it of the irrefutability we need. How can she be sure that this tall man with long hair and a curly beard isn't Florentin Cormier, since that's what characterises him? And it was at night, twelve or fifteen metres away, through a window obscured by paper dust and fog, that this sick woman, whose eyes are cloudy and whose mind is weakened by suffering, was able, in a very short space of time, to see Florentin Cormier, when she had no interest in remembering what she saw, to grasp certain signs that she now remembers strongly enough to affirm that the man who drew the curtains was not Florentin Cormier, against whom so many charges have been brought on various sides, and who has only this testimony to give.... which any sensible person could not fail to find suspicious!
- But it's true," said Saniel, happy to be taken in by his own plea.
- What makes a thing true, my dear, is the way in which it is presented; change that way and we'll distort it. To arrive at the conclusion that made you say: "It's true", I started from the idea that tomorrow Madame Dammauville's account would be known to the courts, that the good lady would be heard in the investigation, and that there would be plenty of time to examine this testimony that you yourself find suspect. Now let's start from the opposite point. Madame Dammauville's account is not known to the courts, or if something transpires from it, we will arrange for that something to be so vague that the prosecution attaches little importance to it; and that is possible if we ourselves do not base a whole new defence on this testimony. We come to the trial, and when the prosecution has heard its witnesses who have overwhelmed us: the business agent Savoureux, the tailor Valérius, etc.; it's Madame Dammauville's turn: she simply tells what she saw, and affirms that the man in the dock is not the same as the one who drew the curtains at a quarter past five. Do you see the twist? The prosecution didn't anticipate it: they didn't investigate the health of the witness; they don't have a doctor there ready to allege impaired vision and reason; most likely, they didn't think about the obscured window, or the distance; in short, all the arguments that could be put against us if we had the time to put them in the right order are missing, and we win the acquittal hands down.
Things, arranged in this way, were too favourable for Saniel not to welcome with a feeling of relief this combination which led to Florentin's acquittal more surely, it seemed, than anything they had put together up to that point in his defence:
- Do we want to admit that Madame Dammauville kept silent about such a serious fact and waited until the hearing to reveal it?
- It's obvious that if she didn't say what she had seen, it's because she had reasons for keeping silent; it's likely that, being ill, she didn't want to expose herself to the trouble and fatigue of an interrogation, when her statement could, in her eyes, be of no great importance. What would she have revealed during the investigation? That the man who had committed the crime was tall, with a curly blond beard? The law had this man, or she had one, the description matched that, which for Madame Dammauville was the same thing; so she didn't have to call the police, the examining magistrate, to tell them anything... insignificant: for her peace of mind and also because she felt she had nothing interesting to say, she didn't speak. It was only when chance put a portrait of the accused before her eyes that she recognised that justice did not have the real culprit, and so she broke her silence. We don't have to specify the moment when chance put this portrait in front of her eyes; I'll take care of that. That's not where the difficulty lies.
- Where do you see it?
- In this: that Madame Dammauville may already have told her story to so many people that it has fallen into the public domain, where the investigation has picked it up; then there's no more drama; she's questioned, her statement is examined, everything we said earlier is set against her, and we're left with nothing but suspect testimony. The first thing to do now, therefore, is to find out how far this story has spread and, if there is still time, to prevent it from spreading further.
- This is not easy, I think.
- I think Mademoiselle Philis can do it. She is a brave girl, valiant, intelligent, determined, who is not deterred or discouraged by anything, and who is living proof that we are only as good as the strength and suppleness of our inner spring; besides, I don't have to praise her, since you know her better than I do, and what I am saying has no other purpose than to explain the confidence I have in her. Since I cannot intervene myself, I feel that no one is in a better position than she to influence Madame Dammauville, without worrying or hurting her, and to bring about the result we are looking for. I am sure that she has already won over Madame Dammauville and that she will be listened to sympathetically.
- Would you like me to write to her and ask her to come and see you tomorrow?
- No; the best thing would be for you to see her yourself this evening, if that's possible.
- I'll go to Batignolles when I leave you.
- She will play her part perfectly, I'm sure; and she will succeed, I hope; but all will not be said.
- It seems to me that your combination depends above all on the coup de théâtre of Madame Dammauville's failure to recognise Florentin: how will you get this paralytic to the hearing?
- I'm counting on you.
- And how will you do that?
- You will examine her.
- I should go to her house!
- Why shouldn't you?
- Because I'm not her doctor.
- You will be.
- I couldn't possibly.
- I don't find it impossible at all that you should be called in for consultation; I haven't forgotten that your thesis was on paralysis due to affection of the spinal cord, and it was remarkable enough for us to have dealt with it in our talk in the rue de Vaugirard; you are therefore an authority on the subject.
- It is not for having done a few works on the pathological anatomy of spinal cord lesions, and especially on alterations of the anterior roots of the spinal cord, that one acquires authority in such a vast and delicate question.
-- Don't be too modest, dear friend; I recently had to consult the article Paralysis in my Dictionary of Medicine, and I saw your work quoted on every page. What's more, the way you've just passed your competitive examination has put you in the spotlight; you're the talk of the town. So it's not impossible that Mademoiselle Philis, telling how her mother was cured of paralysis precisely by you, will lead Madame Dammauville to the idea of consulting you, and that her doctor will call you.
- You won't do that!
- And why shouldn't I?
They looked at each other for a moment in silence, and Saniel looked away.
- I hate nothing so much as appearing to put myself forward.
- In this case, it's not a question of what you hate or what you love: it's a question of saving this unfortunate young man whom you know to be innocent; and you can, to a large extent, help us. You examine Madame Dammauville: you see what paralysis she is suffering from and, consequently, what criticisms can be levelled at her testimony; at the same time you see if you can cure her, or at least put her in a position to come to the hearing.
- And if it is established that she will not be able to leave her bed?
- Then I make a change to my order of battle, and that's why it's vitally important - you know that's the word - that I be warned in advance.
- Are you having the examining magistrate take his statement?
- On no account; but I have her write a letter which I read at the appropriate time, and I quote her doctor so that he can explain why he didn't allow his client to come to the hearing: no doubt the effect would not be what I was looking for, but in the end, we would still have one.
V
After Philis, Nougarède wanted him to see Madame Dammauville, and this coincidence was not the least danger of the situation that was opening up.
If she saw him, the chances were that she would recognise him as the man who had drawn the curtains; for, although he had been able to tell Philis and Nougarède about disturbances of vision or reason, he did not believe in these disturbances, which were for him no more than escape routes.
When he arrived at Madame Cormier's, Philis had not yet returned, and he had to explain to the worried mother why her daughter was late.
It was a delirium of joy before which he felt embarrassed. How could he crush the hopes of this unfortunate mother?
He repeated what he had said to Philis and Nougarède: before seeing Florentin free, it was necessary to know the value of Madame Dammauville's testimony; and he explained how the value of this testimony could be compromised.
- But it is also possible for a paralytic to enjoy all his faculties! cried Madame Cormier with a decision that was neither in her habits nor in her character.
- It certainly is.
- Am I not an example?
- You certainly are.
- Then Florentin would be saved.
- That's what we must hope. I can only protect you from excessive joy by excessive caution; besides, it's likely that Mademoiselle Philis will be able to fix us up when we get back.
- Perhaps you would have done better to go to Rue Sainte-Anne: you would still have found her.
So it was a universal mania to want to send her to Rue Sainte-Anne!
They waited, but conversation was difficult and slow between them; it wasn't Philis or Florentin that Saniel was thinking about, it was him and his own fears; for her part, Madame Cormier was running to meet her daughter: there were long silences which Madame Cormier interrupted by going into the kitchen to check on her dinner, which had been ready for more than two hours and which she was keeping warm.
Not knowing what to say or do in the face of Saniel's sombre expression and his preoccupation, which she could not explain, she asked him if he had eaten.
- No, he hadn't.
I've got some broth from yesterday, Philis didn't think it was bad.
But he didn't accept, which upset Madame Cormier. Saniel had long been a kind of god to her, and since she had seen him so zealous in looking after Florentin, her worship of him had become even more fervent. How many times had she cried out to Philis about him, "How can we ever repay Mr Saniel?" and now, just when she hoped to please him, he refused her. But she didn't hold it against him: no doubt he had his reasons; nothing that came from him could be wrong.
But as the minutes passed and Philis did not arrive, at last her hurried footsteps were heard.
- You've come to tell Mummy?" she exclaimed, catching sight of Saniel.
Normally, Madame Cormier listened respectfully, but she cut him off.
- And Madame Dammauville?" she asked.
- Madame Dammauville has excellent eyes; she's a headstrong woman who manages her fortune without the help of any businessman.
Failing, Madame Cormier dropped into a chair.
- Oh, the poor child! she murmured.
Exclamations of joy escaped her that had no precise meaning.
Philis, radiant, was looking at Saniel, who was making an effort not to remain sombre, and to seem to join in this joy.
- That's what I thought," he said, "but it was imprudent to abandon ourselves today to hopes that tomorrow would have destroyed.
As he spoke, he at least escaped the embarrassment of his situation and Philis' scrutiny.
- What did Mr Nougarède say?" she asked.
- I'll explain it to you in a moment; start by telling us what you've learned about Madame Dammauville; it's her condition that will decide what we do, or at least what Nougarède advises us to do.
- When the concierge saw me coming back," began Philis, "she showed a certain surprise; but she's a good woman who's easily tamed, and I didn't have too much trouble getting her to tell us everything she knows about Madame Dammauville. Madame Dammauville has been widowed three years ago, without children; she is about forty years old; and it is since her widowhood that she has lived in her house in the rue Sainte-Anne. Until last year, she was not in poor health, although she went to the waters at Lamalou every year. A year ago, she was seized by pains that were thought to be rheumatic, and which led to the paralysis that keeps her in bed. Sometimes she suffers to the point of screaming, but these attacks do not last forever. She reads a lot, entertains a few friends, her sister-in-law, the widow of a solicitor, her nephews and nieces, and one of the parish vicars, because she is pious and above all very charitable. Her eyes are excellent. She has never had any delusions or hallucinations. She is very reserved, hates gossip, and seeks above all to live in peace; so the murder of Caffié exasperated her: she didn't want anyone to talk to her about it, and she herself didn't talk to anyone about it; she even said that, if she were in a position to leave her house, she would sell it so as not to hear the name Caffié mentioned again.
- How did she talk about the portrait and the man she saw in Caffié's study?" asked Saniel.
- That's precisely the question the concierge couldn't answer, so I decided to go and see Madame Dammauville again.
- Are you brave!" said Madame Cormier proudly.
- I can assure you that I was hardly brave when I went up the stairs: after what I had just learnt about her character, it was really audacious to come a second time, two hours apart, to disturb her peace and quiet; but it had to be done. She agreed to receive me. On the way up, I had been looking for a reason to justify, or at least to explain, my second visit, and I had only found an adventurous one, for which I must ask your indulgence.
She said this as she turned to Saniel, but with downcast eyes, without daring to look at him and with an emotion that was worrying for him.
- My indulgence?" he said.
- I acted without having the time to think things through and under the pressure of immediate necessity. As Madame Dammauville was surprised to see me again, I told her that what she had told me was so serious and could have such consequences for the life and honour of my brother, that I had thought of coming back the next day accompanied by someone who knew the business, before whom she would repeat her story, and that it was permission to come with this person that I was asking her for; this person was you.
- That person was you. Me!
- And that's why," she said weakly, without looking up at him, "I need your indulgence.
- But I told you..." he exclaimed with a violence that his displeasure at having been disposed of in this way was not enough to justify it.
- ... I had not forgotten that you could not come to Madame Dammauville's house as a doctor without her having sent for you; so it was not as a doctor that I wanted to ask you to come with me... but as a friend, if you will allow me to speak in this way, as the most devoted, firm and generous friend we have had the good fortune to meet in our distress.
- My daughter speaks for me as well as for herself," said Madame Cormier with moved gravity, "and I would like to add that it is a respectful friendship, a deep gratitude that we have dedicated to you.
Although Philis was trembling to see the effect she had had on Saniel, she continued firmly:
- So you accompanied me and, without doing anything ostentatious, without saying anything that could have been said by a doctor, you could examine her while she was talking. Madame Dammauville responded to my request with her consent, given with perfect good grace. I'll go back to her tomorrow and, if you think it's useful, if you think you should accept the role I've given you without consulting you, you can come with me.
He did not reply to these last words, which were both an invitation and a question.
- Didn't you examine her as I told you?" he asked after a moment's reflection.
- With all the attention I was capable of in my anguish: the eyes seemed to me to be straight and uncluttered; the voice was regular and well-paced; the words followed one another without hesitation, the ideas flowed and were expressed in an orderly fashion. There is no trace of suffering on this yellow face, which bears only the mark of resigned pain; she moves her arms freely; but her legs, as far as I could see under the blanket that hid them, are immobile; in several respects it seems to me that her paralysis is similar to Mama's; it is true that in others it differs; she must be extremely cold, for, although the weather is not cold today, the temperature in her room seemed to me to be very high.
- This is an examination," said Saniel, "that a doctor would not have conducted any better, unless he had questioned the patient, and if I had been with you on this visit we would not have known any more than what you have observed. It seems certain that Madame Dammauville is in full possession of the faculties that make her testimony unassailable.
Madame Cormier drew her daughter to her and kissed her passionately.
- So there's nothing for me to do at this lady's house," continued Saniel, with the haste of a man who has just escaped danger; "but your role, mademoiselle, is not over, and tomorrow you must return to her house to fulfil the role that Nougarède has entrusted to you.
He explained what Nougarède expected of her.
- Certainly," she said, "I'll do whatever I'm advised to do for Florentin: I'll go back to Madame Dammauville, I'll go everywhere; but will you allow me to be surprised if we don't take immediate advantage of this declaration to obtain my brother's release?
He repeated the reasons Nougarède had given him for not proceeding in this way.
- I wouldn't want to say anything that sounded like a reproach," replied Madame Cormier with more determination than she usually put into her words; "but perhaps M. Nougarède is bringing personal considerations into his advice. Our interest is that Florentin should be returned to our affection as soon as possible, and that he should be spared the suffering of prison. But I can understand why Mr Nougarède prefers the big day of the hearing, where he can make a fine plea, useful to his reputation, to an order to dismiss the case in which he does not appear.
- Whether or not he made that calculation," says Saniel, "that's just the way things are. I too would have preferred a dismissal, which had the great advantage of ending everything immediately. Nougarède doesn't think this is a good route to take: we have to follow the one he has outlined for us.
- We'll follow it," says Philis, "and I think it will bring the result Mr Nougarède is hoping for, because Madame Dammauville must have told very few people about the portrait. When I tried to get her to explain herself on this point, without asking her the question directly, she told me that she had only told her concierge about the lack of resemblance between the portrait and the man she saw draw the curtains, so that the concierge, who had spoken to her several times about Florentin and my actions, would warn me. So tomorrow I'll see how far her story has spread and I'll come and tell you about it at about five o'clock, unless you'd prefer me to go and see Mr Nougarède straight away.
- Start with me, and we'll go to his house together, if necessary. I will write to him.
- If I understand Mr Nougarède's plan correctly, it seems to me that it depends on Madame Dammauville appearing at the hearing. Will this appearance be possible? That's what I can't know; only a doctor could answer that question.
Saniel didn't want to show that he had understood this new appeal.
- I forgot to tell you," continued Philis, "that the man treating her is Dr Balzajette, who lives in the rue de l'Échelle.
- A solemn man who hides his worthlessness beneath the dignity of his manners.
She must have had an excellent doctor, Madame Dammauville, and one so highly esteemed by his colleagues that, if he didn't cure her, it was because she was incurable.
- So how can we expect him to cure her in time for her to appear at the hearing?
He didn't answer and got up to leave. Mrs Cormier timidly repeated her invitation, but he did not accept, despite the tender look Philis gave him.
VI
Could he resist the pressure that from all sides was pushing him towards the Rue Sainte-Anne? It seemed that nothing was easier than not to commit the folly of yielding to it, and yet such was the persistence of the efforts that were united against him, that he had to wonder if one day he would not be led in spite of himself to obey them: Philis, Nougarède, Madame Cormier; now where would the new attack come from?
Wasn't there something extraordinary here that he would even have described as providential or fatal, if he had believed in Providence or Fatality?
For several months he had achieved complete security, which had convinced him that all danger had been averted for ever; but now all of a sudden this danger was erupting in such conditions that he had to admit that there could no longer be any security for him: today Madame Dammauville was threatening him; tomorrow it would be someone else. Who? He didn't know. Anyone. And it was the anguish of his situation to be condemned to live from now on in fear and on the defensive, without rest, without forgetting.
But it wasn't tomorrow that he had to worry about at the moment, it was the present, in other words Madame Dammauville.
For her to have said so firmly, on the sight of a simple portrait, that the man who had closed the curtains was not a Florentine, she must have had an excellent memory for eyes, together with a resolution of mind and a decision in ideas which enabled her to affirm without hesitation what she believed to be the truth.
If they ever met, she would recognise him and, recognising him, she would speak.
Would she be believed?
That was the decisive question, and it seemed that given the character of this woman surrounded by consideration and respect, who was intelligent, circumspect, reserved, there should be little doubt that she would be, or at least that she would not raise presumptions against him which he would be obliged to defend himself against.
Denials would not suffice. He had not been at Caffié's at a quarter past five. Where was he at that time? What evidence could he adduce to justify the use of his time that evening? Wouldn't it be then that his presence in the café would be pointed out, and would rise up against him to crush him? Caffié's wound had been inflicted by a hand skilled in the art of killing, and it was precisely this skilled hand that was his, even more than that of a professional killer. His situation at the time of the crime was desperate, as everyone knew: desperate, harassed by his creditors, pursued by the bailiffs, threatened with being put out on the street; and it was at this moment that he had suddenly, miraculously, paid his debts. With what? Who could accept the story of Monte Carlo, good when there were no charges against him, detestable and accusatory on the contrary when those charges had been raised.
One word, one insinuation from Madame Dammauville and he was lost, defenceless, without a fight.
In truth, and fortunately, since she was paralysed and confined to her bed, he was not exposed to finding himself face to face with her on the corner of a street or in a third house, nor to hearing the cry of surprise that she would not fail to utter on recognising him; but that was not enough for him to fall asleep in an imprudent security, telling himself that this meeting was improbable. It was also implausible to admit that someone was standing precisely opposite Caffié's window when he had drawn the curtains, and even more implausible to believe that this insignificant fact in itself, this vision of a brief moment, would be engraved firmly enough in a woman's memory to remain vivid after several months ; And yet, out of all these improbabilities, he had formed a reality that held him so tightly that from one moment to the next it could suffocate him. 
In spite of the urgings of Philis, Madame Cormier, Nougarède and all the others, whoever they might be, he would not be foolish enough to face the danger of a reconnaissance in the room where this paralytic was confined -- at least that was probable, for after what had just happened, he was certain of nothing -- but this reconnaissance could very well take place elsewhere.
In Nougarède's plan, Madame Dammauville would come to the hearing to make her declaration; he himself was a witness: they would therefore, at some point, have to meet, and it was not impossible that it would be in the middle of the hearing that the recognition would break out in a more dramatic coup de théâtre than the one Nougarède had arranged.
Undoubtedly, there were many chances that Madame Dammauville would not be able to leave her bed and come to the hearing; but if there was only one chance that she would leave him, he had to foresee it and take precautions.
There was only one guarantee: to make himself unrecognisable, to cut off his beard, to cut off his hair, no longer to be the man with the long hair and the curling blond beard that she remembered: If he had been like everyone else, she would probably not have noticed him when he came to the window, and she would certainly have forgotten him, or at least confused him with others, whereas the singularity of his face and his bearing, his Gallic air, had left a characteristic imprint on her memory that time had not erased: you should only allow yourself to be original when you are sure in advance that you will never have anything to fear. 
Certainly, nothing was easier than to have his beard and hair cut: all he had to do was go to the first barber he came across: in a few minutes the transformation would be radical.
Among the indifferent, he didn't have to worry too much about the curiosity that this change might produce; more than one would not notice it, and those who would be surprised at first would soon think no more of it; besides, for them, there was an easy answer: on the eve of becoming a serious character, he abandoned the latest eccentricities of the old student, and crossed the bridges without a second thought to the left bank.
But it was not only to the indifferent that he owed a debt of gratitude; he owed even more to those with whom he was in regular contact: to Philis, to Nougarède.
Hadn't the lawyer noticed them, the long hair and the curling beard, when he had noticed the similarities between the two descriptions, and, therefore, wasn't it imprudent to make him wonder why all of a sudden what constituted this similarity disappeared in one of the two?
Dangerous for the lawyer, this question became even more so for Philis: Nougarède could only show surprise; Philis could ask for explanations.
And he would have to answer her all the more clearly because, four or five times already, he had almost betrayed himself in relation to Madame Dammauville, and although she had let his exclamations or his moments of embarrassment, his hesitations or his refusals pass without questioning him frankly, she had certainly been astonished: If he appeared before her without hair or a beard, that would be a new astonishment added to the others, connections would be established, and logically, by the very force of things; in spite of herself, in spite of her love and her faith, she would arrive at conclusions from which she could not escape: -- Just like that, all of a sudden; why? -- As he complained one day about middle-class people who didn't want to come to him, she had gently explained to him that, in order to please these middle-class people and attract them, it might not be a very good idea to astonish those who were not shocked: that frock coats of shorter length, hats with a narrower brim, shorter hair, a less shaggy beard, in short, an ensemble that brought him closer to them, would perhaps be more agreeable to them; and at this point he got angry, telling her clearly that he was to be taken as he was or not to be taken, and that these concessions were not part of his character. He had resisted when he needed everyone and a client was a matter of life and death for him; he gave in when he no longer needed anyone and didn't care about clients. The contradiction would really be too strong and such that it could not fail to strike Philis, whose attention had already had too many opportunities to be aroused.
And yet, however delicate the decision to make herself unrecognisable was, it would have been madness on her part to put it off: The sooner the better; his fault had been not to foresee, the day after Caffié's death, that circumstances might arise one day or another that would force him to do it; at that time it would not have presented the same dangers as now; but starting from the idea that he had not been seen by anyone, that he could not have been seen, he had become complacent in the security that this conviction gave him and, quietly, he had become numb to it. 
Instead of taking refuge in miserable loopholes when Philis and Nougarède asked him to see Madame Dammauville, he would have boldly stood up to them and gone to see her as they wanted: now he would be saved and soon Florentin would be too.
Now he would be saved and soon Florentin would be too. And he had thought himself clever! And proudly he had imagined that he could combine things so well in advance that he would be safe from any surprise! The truth was, however, that this impression had faded fairly quickly; but now it was stronger than ever, and was sure to stay with him forever.
But there was no point in going back; it was the present and the future that he had to take a clear, firm look at, if he did not want to lose himself.
After careful consideration, he had to have his hair and beard cut; for, however adventurous this resolution might be, however unfortunate it might become by provoking curiosity and questions, it was the only way to prevent a possible recognition.
Machinically, out of habit, he headed for the rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, where his barber lived; but he had not taken a few steps when reflection stopped him: it would certainly be clumsy to provoke the chatter of this barber who knew him, and who, for the pleasure of chatting, would tell the locals that he had just cut Dr Saniel's hair and beard. -- The one who had such a long beard? -- Himself. -- That's funny. -- There had to be nothing funny about him, or about himself. So he returned to the boulevard where he was certainly not known.
But just as he was about to put his hand on the knob of the shop he had decided to enter, he changed his mind again: he had just found the explanation he needed for Philis, and as he wanted to avoid the surprise she would feel if she suddenly saw him without hair and beard, he would give her this explanation before having them cut, so that, right away and without looking for anything else, she would understand that this operation was essential.
And he went off to dinner, furious at himself and at the miserable expedients to which he had been reduced.
VII
The next day, at five o'clock, when Philis rang the bell, it was he who went to open the door; for Joseph, who had never come on Sundays, did not come now either.
As soon as she entered, she wanted to throw herself around his neck, as usual, with an impulse that showed how happy she was to see him; but he stopped her with his hand.
- What's the matter?" she asked, paralysed and full of fear.
- Nothing, or at least not much.
- Against me?
- Certainly not, my dear.
- Are you ill?
- Not ill, but I have precautions to take that prevent me from kissing you. I'll explain that to you. Don't worry, it's not serious.
- Quick," she exclaimed, examining him to try and anticipate his thoughts.
- Do you have something to tell me?
- Yes, and good ones. But, please, speak first; don't leave me in this state of anxiety.
- I assure you that you have nothing to worry about, and when I talk to you like this, you know that you have to believe me; you can see that I don't seem worried myself.
- You worry about other people, never about yourself.
- Do you know what alopecia is?
- No, I don't.
- It's a special disorder of the hair and beard due to the presence of a kind of fungus in the epidermis; well, I've probably got it.
- How serious is it?
- Annoying and embarrassing for a man, but disastrous for a woman, since before any treatment you have to start by cutting your hair. So you understand that if, as I believe, I have alopecia, I'm not going to expose you to it by kissing you, because it's transmitted extremely easily by contact, and then I'd have to do for you what I'll probably have to do for myself, i.e. cut your hair. For me, it's insignificant; but wouldn't it be murder to sacrifice those beautiful curly locks that give such charm to the face?
- You say: probably.
- It's just that I'm not quite sure I've got alopecia yet. A fortnight ago, I felt a slight itch on my head, and naturally I didn't pay any attention to it; I had other things to do and, besides, I wasn't going to think I had a parasitic disease because of an itch. But, after a while, my hair became dry in patches, dull, and it pulled easily, then fell out spontaneously. I said to myself that I would take care of it, but I didn't have the time and the days went by; besides, in the overwork that my competitions imposed on me, there were more than enough reasons to explain the loss of my hair. Finally today, shortly before your arrival, having a bit of freedom, I wanted to know what I was dealing with and I examined one of these diseased hairs under the microscope; if I hadn't been disturbed, I'd have known for sure by now.
- Resume your examination.
- I've got time; besides, the operation, to be complete, can't be done in a few minutes; after studying the hair, you have to look for the spores in the epidermal films. If it really is alopecia, as I have reason to believe, tomorrow you'll see me without hair or beard; I won't hesitate, despite the astonishment I'll provoke by showing myself shaven.
- What do you care?
- I can't tell everyone: I've had my hair and beard cut off because I'm suffering from a parasitic disease: we know that this disease is contagious, many people would run away from it.
- Once I've had my hair cut, what will happen to the disease?
- With energetic treatment, it will disappear quickly; before long you'll be able to kiss me if... you don't think I'm too ugly.
- Oh dear.
- Now it's your turn: have you just come from Madame Dammauville's?
He didn't need to insist: Philis had accepted his story well enough for him to be reassured on her side; she wouldn't be the one to worry; as for the others, the embarrassment of confessing a contagious disease would also be a sufficient explanation, if he were ever obliged to provide one.
- What did she say to you?
- To begin with, some kind and gracious words which show what an excellent woman she is. After visiting her twice yesterday, you can understand that I was not at ease asking her to see me again today. As I tried to apologise, she interrupted me: "I am delighted to see your devotion to your brother, and you will never have to apologise for asking for my help; you can count on it in everything I can do. Thus encouraged, I explained to her what we wanted from her; but, contrary to the promise she had just made me, she seemed reluctant to grant us this assistance. "What a strange procedure!" she repeated several times. Without being able to give her Mr Nougarède's reasons, I told her that we were obliged to follow the advice of those in charge of the case, and that I begged her to help us. Finally, she relented, but reluctantly and under protest. I'll do what you want," she said; "but I can't assure you that the people around me and the people in my service haven't talked; likewise, I can't promise you that I'll leave this bed to go to the court of assizes on the day of the hearing; I've been keeping the room for a year: they promise me it'll get better soon..." She's planning to get up soon?
- Is she going to get up soon?" interrupted Saniel.
- I'll repeat what she said, which I paid enough attention to remember: "I've been promised that I'll get better soon, but will it come true? I'm going to press my doctor for an answer, and when you come back to see me, I'll let you know. Taking advantage of the door she opened for me, I put the discussion on this doctor: it seems to me, but I'm not sure, that she has only relative confidence in him; He was her husband's classmate, as well as her brother-in-law the solicitor's, he is the relative or friend of everyone she sees, he marries the girls, breaks up the boys' compromising relationships, mends households that are going badly, confesses the wives, distracts the husbands, chooses the servants and, above all, when the opportunity arises, he treats those who are ill, cures them when necessary or lets them die at random; you can see what category of doctor he belongs to. 
- I told you I knew him.
- See if I was wrong, and add to what I'm telling you what you already know. Frightened to see in whose hands Mrs Dammauville was, I took all the roundabout ways I could and ended up knowing - without having asked her directly - that she had not seen another doctor for a year: When the paralysis set in, there was a consultation, and since then she has been content with Dr Balzajette, not so much out of indifference or incredulity, despair or apathy, but so as not to upset him: "He's such a good man! she said to me; why should I upset him? My illness has been established by consultation: he looks after it as well as anyone could.
Saniel took the opportunity to correct the blunder he had made in expressing his opinion of the solemn Balzajette:
- It's likely," he said.
- Is it certain? Do you think that in the last year nothing has arisen in Madame Dammauville's illness that would have required new treatment, which the solemn Balzajette was incapable of finding, on his own?
- He's not as bad as you think.
- You're the one who's talking nonsense.
- Diagnosing an illness and treating it are two different things; it was the consultation you mentioned that established Madame Dammauville's illness and instituted the treatment that Balzajette has only to apply, and his ability, I assure you, is sufficient for the task.
As she showed little reassurance, he felt he had to insist, for it would have been imprudent to leave Philis with the idea that if he treated Madame Dammauville he would surely cure her, even if it took a miracle:
- We've got some time to wait, since the court order for the trial has not yet been handed down; on the other hand, Madame Dammauville has promised to press her doctor to find out whether he hopes to get her out of bed soon; so let's wait and see.
- Wouldn't it be better to act than to wait?
- At least, let's wait for Balzajette's reply to his patient's request; either it will be satisfactory, and then we'll have nothing to do; or it won't be, and then I promise to see Balzajette. I know him well enough to be able to talk to him about your client, especially as I am allowed, by involving your brother, to take an open interest in her recovery.
- Oh, dear, dear," she murmured in a burst of emotional gratitude.
- You cannot doubt my devotion, first to you and then to your poor brother. You asked me to do something impossible which, to my great regret, I had to refuse you, precisely because it was impossible; but, as you well know, I am entirely yours and yours alone.
- Please forgive me.
- I have nothing to forgive you for; in your place I would think like you, but I think that in mine you would act like me.
- You can be sure that I have never had a thought in my heart of blaming you for your dignity; it is because you are tall and proud that I love you so passionately.
She rose to her feet.
- You're leaving," he said.
- I'd like to pass on Madame Dammauville's kind words to my mother: you can feel how anxious she is waiting for me.
- Let's go; I'll leave you at the boulevard to go up to Nougarède's.
The interview with the lawyer was short.
- You see, my dear friend, that my plan is a good one; bring me Madame Dammauville to the hearing and we'll spend a few pleasant moments together.
This time, Saniel didn't hesitate as he had the day before, and he went into the first barber's shop he found on his way.
- Does the gentleman want his hair curled?" asked the waiter as he sat down in an armchair.
- No, I want my hair clipped and shaved.
- That's a good example!
When Saniel returned home, he lit two candles and, placing them on his mantelpiece, looked at himself in the mirror.
Coquetry had never been his sin, and he had often spent weeks without stopping to look in the mirror: a washcloth with a rough cloth, a comb through his hair, a hard brushing of his beard, his tie tied up like the devil, and that was his whole grooming routine, for which mirrors were of no use to him. However, when he was a young boy, before he grew a beard, he had sometimes stood in front of the little mirror in his washbasin, studying himself with curiosity, wondering what he was and what he would become, just as, thinking about his future and probing his intelligence, he had wondered what he would be good at and what kind of man life would make of him; And from that time he remembered an energetic face with clearly defined features, an open and frank physiognomy which, without being what one would call pretty, was nevertheless not unpleasant. Since then, the beard had grown, hiding some of his features and changing his physiognomy; but now that it had fallen away, he told himself without thinking too much that he would undoubtedly find the young boy whose image he had kept in his memory.
What he found in front of the mirror was a transversely wrinkled forehead, oblique eyebrows, raised at the inner end, and a mouth with tight lips, lowered at the corners; furrows were dug into the cheeks, and the whole face, battered and ravaged, expressed harshness.
What had become of the young man of yesteryear? He was looking at the man life had made, whose face had been shaped by the violent contractions of his facial muscles.
- That really is the face of a murderer! he murmured.
Then, looking at his shaven head, he added with a sad smile:
- And perhaps that of a condemned man whose toilet has just been prepared for the guillotine.
VIII
To have made himself unrecognisable was no doubt a good precaution; but, having taken this route, he would not rest until he had exhausted them all, and in such a way that Madame Dammauville would never be able to find the man she had seen so clearly under Caffié's lamp.
Precisely because he was not coquettish and had no pretensions to beauty or seduction, he had escaped the photographic mania. Only once had he been photographed, and even then in spite of himself, after defending himself, simply so as not to refuse without reason an old friend who, abandoning medicine for photography, had wanted his head.
But now this one time was too much, because there could be a danger that his portrait, made three years earlier, and showing him with the hair and beard he had just removed, would be seen all over the world. Undoubtedly, there was little chance that he would ever pass a proof before Madame Dammauville's eyes; but, if there was only one against a hundred thousand, he had to make sure that he didn't have to fear it. One newspaper had published Florentin's portrait; at a given moment and in certain circumstances that could not be foreseen, but which were possible at the very least, another newspaper might also publish his. This was not to be, and for his own peace of mind he did not want to think that this danger could threaten him.
He had sent one to his mother, who was still alive at the time, one to the village priest and, later, he had given one to Philis, so he must have had nine left. He searched for them and, having found them in their box at the back of the drawer where he had put them when he had received them, he immediately burnt them.
Of the three that remained, only one could testify against him, that of Philis; but it would be easy for him to take it back by inventing a pretext; as for the other two, it was not admissible, really, that he would ever have anything to fear from them, his mother's having passed into the hands of an old aunt, who kept it hung by four nails on the smoke-filled wall of her cottage; his priest's being hidden deep in a remote village where no one would go and dig it up.
But where danger could arise, and where it was wise to wait for it, was with the photographer, who might have proofs in hand and who would surely keep the photograph.
As he entered the studio of his old comrade, he felt an unpleasant disappointment that troubled and worried him: he hadn't given his name, and relying on the changes that the cut of his hair and his beard brought to his physiognomy, he had told himself that this comrade, whom he hadn't seen for a long time, would certainly not recognise him.
When he had taken a few steps into the studio, hat in hand, like a stranger approaching a stranger, he saw the photographer coming towards him, hand outstretched, a friendly smile on his face:
- You, my dear! What good fortune has earned me the pleasure of your visit; is there anything I can do for you?
- Do you recognise me?
- What if I do? Are you asking me to get rid of your beard and hair? Obviously, it changes you and gives you a new look; but I would be unworthy of my profession if, because of a hair arrangement, I allowed myself to be so confused that I didn't recognise you. Besides, steely eyes like yours cannot be forgotten: they are a sign and a signature.
So this method in which he had put so much trust was just another careless move, just as the question "Do you recognise me?
- We're going to pose right away, aren't we? said the photographer. Very curious, that shaven head, and even more interesting, I think, than with the beard and hair: the character traits stand out better.
- It's not for a new portrait that I've come, it's for the old one; do you have any proofs?
- I don't think so; but we'll look for them; in any case, if you want some, it's easy to get away with it, since I have the plate.
- I don't have a single print of the ones you gave me, and when I looked at myself in the mirror this morning, I found such changes between my face today and the one I had three years ago that I'd like to study them; in this connection, ideas have occurred to me about facial expression, the accuracy of which I'd like to check with supporting documents.
The research carried out by a clerk produced no results: there were no proofs.
- A few days ago I was thinking of having some printed," said the photographer, "because now you've finally reached the day of glory when your portrait has its rightful place in showcases and collections: your competitions are the talk of the town. Although I have given up medicine with no intention of returning, I have not become indifferent to everything to do with it, and I have experienced your successes. Which portrait will we put into circulation? The old one or the new one?
- The new one.
- So let's get ready to pose.
- Not today; it was only yesterday that I had a shave, following a threat of alopecia, and the skin covered by the beard has retained a rawness of whiteness, which would accentuate the harshness of my physiognomy, which is really unnecessary; so we'll wait until the air has browned me a little; then I'll come back, I promise.
- How many proofs would you like of your old portrait?
- One is enough for me.
- I'll send you a dozen.
- Don't bother, I'll take them when I come to pose, but in the meantime couldn't you show me the plate?
- Nothing could be easier; it will be brought to you.
Saniel took the glass plate with his fingertips, delicately and carefully, at two opposite corners, so as not to erase it; then, as he was in the shadow of a blue curtain stretched under the window, he stepped out of it towards the fireplace, where the light was falling brightly, and began his examination.
- That's it," he said, "very curious!
- Only a photograph has this kind of documentary value.
To compare this document with reality, Saniel moved closer to the fireplace, above which was a mirror; when his feet touched the marble slab that formed the frame of the hearth, he stopped, looking alternately at the photograph, which he held preciously in his hands, and at his face reflected in the mirror.
Suddenly he let out an exclamation: he had just dropped the cliché, which, falling flat on the marble, had broken into small pieces that had jumped here and there.
- How clumsy of me!
He showed a spite that should have left no doubt in the photographer's mind: it was a lost piece of work, and anyone who has worked knows that you don't accept such a disappointment light-heartedly.
You'll have to get hold of one of the proofs you gave us," said the photographer, "because as far as I'm concerned I haven't got a single one; but that shouldn't be impossible.
- I'll look for one.
What he wanted to know when he left was whether or not he had succeeded in making himself unrecognisable, for he could not confine himself to this experience, which was flawed by the very fact that this old friend was a photographer: it was his trade to note the typical features that distinguish one physiognomy from another, and he had acquired through long practice a sure eye that Madame Dammauville could not possess.
Of all the people with whom he was acquainted, it seemed to him that the one in the best position to give certainty to the test was Madame Cormier. And he immediately went up to Les Batignolles: at that hour, he knew Philis was going out for a lesson; Madame Cormier would be alone, and, as she had certainly not been informed by her daughter that he was to have a shave, the experiment would be conducted in such a way as to give as exact a result as possible.
When the doorbell rang, it was Mrs Cormier who came to open the door and he saluted without her recognising him, but as the entrance was dark, this was of little significance. Hat in hand, he followed her into the dining room, without speaking so that his voice would not betray him.
Then, after she had stared at him for a moment, surprised at first, she began to smile:
- But it's Mr Saniel! she exclaimed. My God! how silly I am not to have recognised you; it's such a change to have had a shave! I beg your pardon.
- It's because I've had a shave that I've come to ask you a favour.
- To us, dear sir! Ah, speak quickly; we would be so happy to show you our gratitude.
- I'd like to ask Miss Philis to give me back, if she still has it, a photograph I gave her about a year ago.
As Philis wanted the freedom to show this photograph frankly, so as to keep it always in front of her, it was in the presence of her mother that she asked for it and in the presence of Madame Cormier that Saniel gave it to her.
- If she still has it!" exclaimed Madame Cormier; "my dear sir, you don't know the place that all your kindnesses and the services you have rendered us have won for you in our hearts.
Saniel took it out, explaining the study for which he needed it and, having promised to bring it back soon, he returned home.
Decidedly, everything had worked out well: the cliché destroyed, Philis's proof in his hands, he had nothing more to fear on that score; as for the experiment tried on Madame Cormier, it was decisive enough to inspire him with full confidence: If Mrs Cormier, who had seen him so often, for so long, and who thought of him every moment, had not recognised him, how could Mrs Dammauville, who had seen him only from a distance and for only a few seconds, recognise him after several months? 
He would never get used to the idea that his life could not have the tranquil monotony of a bourgeois existence, that it would have its bumps and storms, but that, if he knew how to always remain in control of his strength and will, he would have to bring it to a safe harbour!
The calm he had felt before the storm soon returned, and when the final rounds of his competitions, confirming the success of the first, had given him the two titles he had so ardently desired and pursued at the cost of so much pain, so much effort and so much hardship, he could safely enjoy his triumph.
At last, he had the present in his strong hands, and the future was his!
Now he could walk straight, boldly, with his head held high, shoving aside those who got in his way, at a pace that suited his temperament.
Although the last few months had been terribly agitated for him by everything to do with the Caffié and Florentin affair, and above all by the fatigue, emotions and fevers of his competitions, he had nevertheless not interrupted his individual work for a day or an hour, and his experiments, which he had been pursuing for so many years, had finally yielded important results, which only prudence had prevented him from publishing. In opposition to the official teaching of the school, these discoveries would have raised the hairs on old skulls where none had been seen for a long time, and it was not the moment, when he asked for the door, to attract the hostility of those venerable doorkeepers who would block the way to a revolutionary. But now that he was in place for at least ten years, he no longer had to be sparing with people or ideas, and he could speak out.
IX
Saniel had seen his colleague the solemn Balzajette, and, skilfully enough not to provoke either surprise or suspicion, he had been able to tell him about Madame Dammauville, in whom he was incidentally interested; without insisting, in passing and only to justify his question, he had explained the nature of this interest.
To be solemn, Balzajette was no less talkative, and it was even his solemnity that made him talk: he listened to himself talk, and when, with his legs slightly apart, he was sitting comfortably on a pavement that wasn't too narrow, puffing out his chest, resting his pink, clean-shaven chin on his white tie, and making noble, demonstrative gestures in the air with his ringed hand, if you had the patience to listen to him, you could get him to say anything you wanted: His patients could be waiting for him in pain or in anguish, but he would not hasten the majestic flow of his rhapsodic sentences with their choice adjectives, and unless he was going to an invitation to dinner, which happened to him at least five days a week, he would not let you go until he had shared with you the admiration he professed for himself. 
Madame Dammauville's paralysis was due to an affection of the spinal cord: consequently, it was perfectly curable; and even Balzajette was surprised that, with his treatment and care, this cure was slow in coming:
- But what can I tell you, young colleague? You know better than I do that with women anything is possible... especially the impossible!
And for half an hour he had complacently recounted the astonishment caused to his knowledge and experience by the women of the world whom he treated: certainly he had no intention of disputing the lessons that the doctor receives in hospital - God forbid that he should have such arrogance! -- But how much more varied, how much more complete, how much more profound were those given by a social clientele when one was fortunate enough to have created one for oneself.
- To sum up, what can I tell you, young colleague?
And what he had said over and over again, explained and re-explained in tangled digressions, was how he wanted to get his client back on her feet before long. Of course, he had no intention of disputing the recent work published on the pathological anatomy of spinal cord lesions - God forbid that he should be so arrogant! -- But experience is experience, and, without being boastful, he believed he could rely on the experience he had acquired over thirty years of practice with his social clientele.
- You don't treat a duchess like a trader of the four seasons, do you, my young colleague?
Although Balzajette did not read anything outside a boulevardier newspaper and never opened a book to keep up to date, Saniel's young reputation had reached him, - through his ears, - and precisely because it was young, he was keen to spare this colleague, who seemed destined to make a name for himself. Despite the high esteem he professed for his merits and his person, he was vaguely aware that the doctors of his generation, who had reached great heights, did not treat him with all the consideration he gave himself, and, to teach a lesson to his old comrades, he was quite happy to establish good relations with a young man on the move; he would speak of his young colleague Saniel: "You know, the one who has just been appointed agrégé", and he would tell of the advice Balzajette had given him.
Saniel doubted very much that Madame Dammauville would be back on her feet in time to come to the hearing, especially after Balzajette had explained her treatment; but, with the situation that this appearance would have put her in, he could only rejoice. Without doubt, it would be unfortunate for Florentin not to have this testimony and not to take advantage of the coup de théâtre prepared by Nougarède; but, for himself, he could only be happy. Despite all the precautions he had taken, it was better not to expose himself to an encounter with Madame Dammauville in the witness room or even at the hearing. They would stick to a letter supported by Balzajette's deposition, and Florentin would still be acquitted: only Nougarède would have to regret his stunt; but he had no need to worry about Nougarède's satisfaction or disappointment.
Of course, he had not told Philis the ideas that his conversation with Balzajette had suggested to him, merely summarising the conclusions of that conversation: before long Madame Dammauville would be back on her feet; Balzajette said so; if he was not an infallible master, he knew enough to be taken at his word: If he wasn't an infallible master, he knew enough for us to take him at his word: since he promised a quick improvement, we had to believe it: Florentin would be saved; all we had to do was let things go, they were on the right track, as right as if we had directed them ourselves. 
And Philis, Madame Cormier, Nougarède, Florentin himself, whom the Mazas cell had not, however, reconciled either with hope or with providential justice, were all complicit in this idea.
So when the indictment division referred Florentin to the assizes, Madame Cormier and Philis were not too upset: Madame Dammauville would be in a position to give her evidence, since she had been able to leave her bed the day before, and even though she had only been up for an hour, even though she had only been able to leave her room to go to her sitting room, that was enough. Nougarède said that the case would come up at the second session in April: by then, Madame Dammauville would be strong enough on her feet to appear before the jury and win her acquittal.
With Philis, Saniel had repeated that the cure was certain, and with her too he had rejoiced greatly; but at the same time he had been worried about this cure: this meeting, the very idea of which had frightened him to the point of making him lose his head, was therefore going to happen and under conditions that could not fail to move him. In truth, the precautions he had taken should have reassured him, but there was still a disturbing uncertainty. Who could know! He would have preferred it if she hadn't left her room, as Balzajette's treatment suggested she would, and if Nougarède had found a way of obtaining her statement without her bringing it herself; he would have felt more reassured, and it would have been with a calmer mind, and a more impassive face, that he would have gone to the hearing.
Was he really unrecognisable? This was the question that now obsessed him, and several times a day he would stand in front of a mirror, holding the photograph he had taken at Philis's house, and at length he would compare his present appearance with the one in the portrait. Sometimes he found that the dissimilarities were such that anyone who didn't know in advance that these two faces belonged to the same head would never imagine it. But at other times he was struck by the points of contact, and then he told himself that they could also strike Madame Dammauville. The beard and hair had fallen out, but the eyes - those steely eyes, as his old friend the photographer used to say - had remained, and nothing could change or hide them. There was one way: wear a blue lorgnon or glasses, injure himself in a chemistry experiment that would require a bandage; but this would be a disguise that would provoke curiosity and questions all the more dangerous because it would coincide with the removal of the beard and hair. -- Why did he try to change his appearance so completely? -- We shouldn't have asked ourselves that, because it would be opening up a trail that could lead far.
But these worries did not torment him for long, for Philis, who now passed every day in the rue Sainte-Anne to check on Madame Dammauville, arrived one evening in despair and told him that that day the patient had only been able to stay up for a few minutes and had had to return to bed.
So she would not be going to the hearing.
This apprehension of coming face to face with Madame Dammauville had finally exasperated him: he thought himself a coward to put up with it, and, since he didn't have the strength to shake it off, he was happy to find himself rid of it by the mere intervention of chance, which, after having been bad for him for so long, was becoming good for him; the wheel was turning.
- See Madame Dammauville every day," he said to Philis, "and take note of everything she feels; perhaps I'll find something to fix this snag that I can suggest to Balzajette without him suspecting anything. Besides, it's likely that the cold snap we're experiencing has a lot to do with her relapse, and it's probable that with a bit of spring warmth she'll get better.
In her anguish, which was increasing as the trial drew nearer, Philis could not rely on probabilities or on the uncertain influence of spring. She needed more and better; but, for fear of being refused, she was careful not to tell him what she hoped to obtain.
It was only when she had succeeded that she spoke.
Every evening, as she left Madame Dammauville's, she came to tell her what she had learned, and for three days her story had been the same:
- She can't leave her bed.
And he always gave her the same answer:
- It's the cold; certainly, the weather will change: at the end of March, this frost and this wind cannot continue.
He was saddened by her desolation and anguish, but what could he do? It wasn't his fault that this relapse had occurred just at the decisive moment; chance had been against him for long enough: he wasn't going to upset it at the very moment when it was on his side, by giving in to the desire that Philis didn't dare express, but which he guessed, and agreeing to see Madame Dammauville.
On the fourth day, when she entered his study, he knew at once from her demeanour that some happy change for Florentin had occurred.
- Has Madame Dammauville got up yet?
- No, she hasn't!
- I thought so from the vivacity and lightness of your entrance.
- Well, I'm very happy indeed: Madame Dammauville wants to consult you.
He grabbed both her hands violently and shook them:
- You did this!" he cried.
She looked at him in horror.
- You! You!" he repeated with growing fury.
- At least listen to me," she whispered, "you'll see that I haven't compromised you in any way.
Compromise! It was professional dignity he was really thinking of!
- I don't have to listen to you: I'm not going.
- Don't say that.
- All you needed was to do with me as you pleased.
- Victor?
Anger made him panic.
- So I belong to you; so I'm your thing; so you do what you want with me; you decide and all I have to do is obey! It's all too much in the end! You can leave, it's all over between us.
She listened to him shattered; but this last word, which struck at her love, gave her back her strength; in her turn she took both his hands, and although he wanted to free them, she held them in hers:
- You can throw all the words of anger in my face; you can reproach me as much as you think I deserve; I won't rebel. No doubt I am wrong towards you, and I feel their full extent when I see how deeply you are hurt; but to drive me away, to tell me that everything is over between us, no, Victor, you won't do that; you won't say that, because you know that no man has ever been loved like I love you, adored, respected: and voluntarily, of my own free will, even to save my brother, I would have compromised you!
He pushed her away:
- Go away," he said harshly.
She threw herself on her knees and, holding the hands he had taken from her, she kissed them desperately.
- But listen to me," she cried, "before you condemn me, let me say what I have to say for myself. Even if I were a hundred times more guilty than I really am, you cannot reject me with such merciless harshness.
- Go away!
- You're losing your mind; your anger is leading you astray. What's the matter with you? It can't be me who, through my clumsiness, through my fault, has put you in this state of mad exasperation. What's the matter, my beloved?
These few words did more than Philis's desperate submission and her bursts of love: she was right, he was losing his head; and however guilty she was towards him, she could not obviously admit that the fault she had committed had thrown him into this fit of furious madness; it was not natural, and in his words as in his actions, everything had to be natural, everything had to be explainable.
- Well, speak," he said, "I'm listening; besides, it's better to know. So speak.
X
- You must understand," she said a little more calmly, for, since he was allowing her to speak, she hoped to convince him, "that for the last four days I have done everything I could to bring Madame Dammauville to the idea of calling in a doctor to consult with Mr Balzajette?
- Who would be me.
- ... You or someone else; I didn't mention any names; you mustn't think me clumsy enough to rudely put yourself forward; it wouldn't have been a good way of getting an intelligent woman to accept you; and I care enough about your dignity not to play with it. I believed that a doctor other than Mr Balzajette would find a remedy, a means of some kind, a miracle, if you like, that would enable Madame Dammauville to go to court, and I said so; I said it in every tone, in every way, with as much persuasion as I could put into my words. Wasn't it my brother's life I was defending, our honour? At first I found Madame Dammauville very opposed to the idea. -- Another doctor, what's the point? Mr Balzajette had treated her well, since he had been able to get her out of bed. It's true that she had to take him back; but that was an accident that could not be blamed on him without injustice. How many reasons could explain this accident? Her long illness, her weakness, the bad weather. She would get better soon, she felt. Besides, even if she had to be taken to the courthouse, she wouldn't hesitate.
- She would do that!
- Of course she would. No one has a greater sense of what is right than she does: she would be guilty of not giving evidence for an innocent man; not to save him when she could would be to take responsibility for his loss. So it's certain that, if she can't come to the hearing on her own, she'll do her utmost to get there any way she can, on Mr Balzajette's arm, on a stretcher. So I was quite calm about that, but not about the stretcher. What would people think if they saw it in that state? What impression would this patient make on the jurors! Would her illness make her testimony worthless? That made me insist. I think I told you that Madame Dammauville now shows me affectionate sympathy, which increases every day: she makes me stay near her longer; she listens to me with kindness; finally she shows me true friendship; as if I had known her for a long time and had been able to do her a favour. I took advantage of this kindness to return to the question of the consultation, but, I repeat, without mentioning your name and without ever putting yourself forward. Let that be clearly understood and, please, believe me when I say it. I told her that, since Mr Balzajette could say to himself, with all the appearances of reason, that he had cured her, he should not be angry that she wished to seek to consolidate this cure; that, moreover, she had compelling reasons which obliged her not to wait, for it would cost her a great deal to appear at the court of assizes in a theatrical device which was not at all in her character or in her habits. It didn't take much shrewdness for me to guess that the main obstacle to this consultation was the concern to upset this old friend of her husband's, whom she is too intelligent not to know. It was then that your name was mentioned.
- So you admit it!
- You'll see how and you'll say whether you should be angry about it. I didn't spend so much time with Madame Dammauville without telling her about Mama, and consequently without telling her how you cured her of a paralysis which, in more ways than one, resembled hers. It wasn't wrong, was it, to say what you had done for us, and, without giving anything away about my love, I could undoubtedly praise you out of sheer gratitude. You know patients too well not to guess that Madame Dammauville herself had first asked me many times about the similarities between her paralysis and Mama's, about the treatment you had ordered and the effects it had produced, and naturally, as always when I speak of you, when I have the joy of pronouncing your name, I answered her at length and in detail.
She waited a moment, looking at him; without softening the hardness of his gaze, he beckoned her to continue.
- When I insisted on the consultation, Madame Dammauville remembered what I'd told her and was the first -- you mean the first -- to mention your name. I had no reason, it seems to me, to confine myself to a reserve that would have been inexplicable and incomprehensible; so I told her everything a woman could say about a man in your position. Since you had treated and cured my mother, I had every right to praise you; with a nature like hers, she wouldn't have understood if I hadn't, and she would certainly have thought I was being ungrateful. I quoted your work on diseases of the medulla oblongata, and that too was quite natural: since it was from a disease of the medulla that my mother had been cured, it was permissible for me, however ignorant I was of medicine, to have read and studied it before the cure. As she expressed a desire to know it, I offered to lend it to her...
- Is that natural?
- With anyone other than Madame Dammauville, no, no doubt; but she is not a frivolous person, her reading is serious; she knows a lot; in the end, I thought I could lend it to her without doing any harm and without incurring your reproach. I took it to her two days ago, and just now she told me that she had decided to call you after reading it.
- I'm certainly not going: she has her doctor.
- Don't imagine that I've been asked to ask you to visit her; everything is agreed with Mr Balzajette, who is supposed to write to you or see you, I don't know exactly.
- That would be quite extraordinary coming from Balzajette!
- Perhaps you're misjudging him. When Madame Dammauville spoke to him about you, he didn't raise the slightest objection; on the contrary, he praised you; he says that you are one of the rare young people who can be trusted; these are his own words that Madame Dammauville told me.
- I don't care what that old beast thinks!
- I'll explain how you came to be seen, not because I mentioned you, but because Mr Balzajette trusts you. No matter how stupid he is, he does you justice and knows what you're worth.
So the moment had arrived for this meeting, which he had not wanted to believe possible at first, but which, nevertheless, presented itself in such conditions that he could not see how to avoid it. He could refuse Philis, but Balzajette? How? On what pretext? A colleague was calling him in for a consultation, why wouldn't he go? He would have left Paris until the trial, but he was caught unawares. What could he say to justify an absence he had not announced? He had no mother, no brothers who could call him and with whom he was obliged to stay. Besides, he wanted to go to the hearing, and since his testimony would carry considerable weight with the jury, it was his duty to bring it to Florentin; it would have been a contemptible cowardice to fail in this duty, and, moreover, it would have been imprudent: in the eyes of everyone, he had to appear to have nothing to fear, and this assurance, this self-confidence, was one of the conditions of his salvation. Now, if he came to the hearing, and from every point of view it was impossible that he wouldn't, he would meet Madame Dammauville there, since she wanted to be taken there in case she couldn't go freely. Either at her home or at the Palace of Justice, the meeting was therefore fatal, and, whatever he might have done, circumstances stronger than his will had prepared and brought it about: whatever he tried would not prevent it.
The only question worthy of serious consideration at this time was where this meeting would be less dangerous for him -- at Madame Dammauville's, or at the Palais? Everything else was above him and beyond his control.
He was thinking silently, not paying any more attention to Philis than if she were not near him, not looking at her, his eyes lost in vagueness, his forehead contracted, his lips tightened, when the doorbell rang: as Joseph was at his post, Saniel did not move.
- If he's ill," said Philis, who didn't want to leave yet, "I'll wait in the dining room.
And she got up.
Before she had left, Joseph entered:
- Monsieur le docteur Balzajette," he said.
- You see," cried Philis.
Without answering, Saniel motioned to Joseph to bring in Dr Balzajette, and as she quietly disappeared, he headed for the living room.
Balzajette came to him with both hands outstretched:
- Hello, my young colleague! Pleased to meet you.
The welcome was kind, friendly and also protective; Saniel responded as best he could.
- Ever since we met," continued Balzajette, "I've been thinking about you. The first time you came to visit me, I liked you straight away; I guessed you and said to myself: "There's a big boy who'll make his mark". Do you remember?
He certainly did, and of all the visits he had made to the doctors and pharmacists in his neighbourhood at that time, the one to Balzajette had been the hardest; it was impossible to show more arrogance, more haughtiness, more disdain, than this solemn man had shown in his welcome. But then the young confrere was lost in the crowd of poor devils and in all likelihood he would stay there; whereas, now that he had left it, we didn't know where he would go.
- I told you I'd been thinking about you," continued Balzajette, "about that client you told me about, you know?
- Madame Dammauville?
- Precisely. I got her back on her feet, as I was sure I would and as I told you; but since then, this bad temperature has put her back to bed. It's only a matter of days, no doubt; only, in the meantime, the poor woman is getting irritated and impatient; you know, young colleague, women! So what can I tell you? To calm this impatience, I spontaneously offered her a consultation, and naturally I mentioned your name, which had been indicated by your fine work on spinal cord lesions; I supported him appropriately, with the esteem he had earned for himself, and I had the satisfaction of seeing him accept.
Saniel thanked him as if he believed in the sincerity of this spontaneous proposal.
- I like young people, and I want you to know that whenever the opportunity arises, I'll be happy to introduce you to my clientele. For Madame Dammauville, what day would you like us to take?
As Saniel seemed hesitant, Balzajette, misunderstanding the reason for his silence, insisted:
- She's impatient," he said; "so let's take the earliest possible day.
An answer had to be given, and under the circumstances a refusal could not be explained.
- Do you want tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, of course. What time?
Before answering, Saniel went to his desk and consulted an almanac, which seemed perfectly ridiculous to Balzajette:
- Does the young colleague imagine that I'm going to think his time is so tightly taken that he needs some combination to give me an hour? But it was nothing of the sort that Saniel was looking for: to pose in front of this old fool, to dazzle him, he had a mind for that! His almanac gave sunrise and sunset, and it was the precise time of sunset that he wanted: 26th March, 6.20 a.m. At that moment, it would not yet be dark enough for the lamps to be lit in Madame Dammauville's house, and yet the day would already be dark enough for her to see it badly in the uncertainty of the evening.
- Would you like a quarter past six? I'll pick you up at six.
- Gladly; only I would ask you to be very exact; I have a dinner for seven o'clock in the Rue Royale.
And Saniel promised to be exact; this dinner was a favourable circumstance which promised him to leave Madame Dammauville's before the lamps were brought in.
When Balzajette had left, he went to join Philis in the dining room, where she was waiting anxiously:
- An appointment has been made for tomorrow, at a quarter past six, at Madame Dammauville's house.
She threw herself around his neck:
- I knew you would forgive me.
XI
It was not without emotion that Saniel watched the afternoon pass the next day and, although he had set to work to make the most of his time, he stopped every moment to look at the clock.
Sometimes he found that the clock was ticking fast, then immediately that it was not ticking at all.
This restlessness exasperated him, because calm had never been more necessary than in these circumstances; if danger presented itself, it was only by remaining in control that he could save himself: he needed the composure of a surgeon in an operation, the vision of a general in battle, and composure and vision are neither found in the nervous or the restless.
Would this danger arise?
This was the question that kept coming back, that imposed itself, whatever he did to avoid it, and threw him into a confusion that was all the more irritating because he was perfectly aware of the futility of such an examination. What was the point of studying the pros and cons? It was all up in the air, in the hands of chance, and therefore beyond his control.
Either he had succeeded in making himself unrecognisable, or he had not; that was a fact he could do nothing about now.
What was humanly possible in this respect he had foreseen by choosing an hour when the darkness of the evening put the odds in his favour; for the rest, he had to rely on Fortune.
And going to his fireplace, he stood in front of the mirror, comparing his face with the photograph Mrs Cormier had given him, and muscle after muscle, he studied himself. Ah! if he hadn't had those pale blue eyes, those steely eyes, he would have felt calmer; but in the darkness, would Madame Dammauville see his gaze?
All day long he had studied the sky, because for the success of his plan it was important that it was neither too light nor too dark: too light, because Madame Dammauville would be able to get a good look at him; too dark, because the lamps would be lit. He had to remember that it was precisely under the light of a lamp that she had seen him. Until the evening, the weather was uncertain, with a sometimes sunny, sometimes cloudy sky; but then the clouds were blown away by a northerly wind, and the weather turned decidedly cold, with the pale pink light of late March when it is still freezing.
On examining himself carefully, he had the satisfaction of noting that he was calmer than he had been in the morning, and that as the moment of the assault drew nearer his agitation subsided: decision, firmness and composure had returned to him; he felt master of his will and capable of obeying it alone.
At six o'clock on the dot, he rang Balzajette's doorbell and they left immediately for the Rue Sainte-Anne. Happy to have a listener with willing ears, Balzajette did all the talking, without Saniel having to answer anything other than yes or no from time to time, and, of course, it wasn't Madame Dammauville he was talking about, but worldly stories: of the first performance of the previous day at the Opéra-Comique, which he had attended; of politics; of the forthcoming Salon, where several important paintings would be shown, for which the painters had asked his opinion, certain in advance that it would be that of public opinion. 
At just a quarter past six, they arrived at the house in the rue Sainte-Anne, where Saniel had not been since Caffié's death. As they passed the dressing room of the old concierge, who greeted Balzajette respectfully, he was pleased with himself: his heart wasn't beating too fast, his ideas were firm and clear, all in the present moment, neither here nor there: if any danger arose he felt sure he could face it without panic or brutality.
When Balzajette rang the bell, the door was immediately opened by a chambermaid who had obviously been posted in the vestibule to await their arrival.
Balzajette went first and Saniel followed, giving a quick glance at the rooms they were passing through: a dining room furnished in mahogany, and a drawing room with faded tapestries; they had reached a door on which Balzajette knocked twice.
- Come in," answered a firm-sounding woman's voice.
It was the decisive moment: the day was just right, neither too bright nor too dark. What would Madame Dammauville's first glance tell her?
- My colleague Dr Saniel," announced Balzajette as he went to shake hands with Madame Dammauville.
She was lying on the little bed Philis had mentioned, but not against the windows, but rather in the middle of the room, obviously placed there according to the experience of a patient who knows that people will have to turn around her to examine her.
Taking advantage of this arrangement, Saniel passed immediately between the bed and the windows, so that the light would hit him from behind and leave his face in shadow; this was done naturally, without any affectation, and it seemed that he had only taken this side of the bed because Balzajette had taken the other.
The examination began, conducted by Saniel with a neatness and precision that pleased Balzajette: He went straight to the point, asking and seeking only what was essential, and, as Madame Dammauville's answers were as precise as Saniel's questions, while listening and saying a brief word from time to time, he told himself that his dinner would not be delayed, which was the main point of his concern. He was a boy to protect, to launch: with his heavy bearing, his rough demeanour, his careless dress, there would be no rivalry to fear; before he had acquired the manners and correctness of a man of the world, if he ever did, time would pass.
However, when Madame Dammauville complained about the cold she was feeling, Balzajette found that Saniel let her lose herself in rather minute details.
- Have you always been cold?
- Yes, and with an annoying tendency to catch a cold if the temperature drops a degree or two.
- Did you exercise outdoors?
- Very little.
- Didn't anyone ever advise you to take cold water baths?
- I couldn't stand them.
- I must tell you," interrupted Balzajette, "that before living in this house, this old house which belongs to her, Madame Dammauville occupied a more modern flat, where she was heated by the calorifère, and where, consequently, it was easy for her to maintain a mild and uniform temperature to which she had become accustomed.
- When I came to live in this house, where it was not possible to install a calorifier," continued Madame Dammauville, "I did everything I could to protect myself from the cold which, I am sure, is my great enemy: you can see that I had double stuffing put in the doors as well as the windows.
Despite this invitation and the gesture that accompanied it, Saniel was careful not to turn his head towards the window; he kept his face in the shade, content to look at the door that faced him.
- At the same time," continued Madame Dammauville, "I've put wall hangings on the walls, carpets on the floor, thick curtains on the windows and doors, and despite the big fires I keep in my fireplace, I often can't keep warm.
- Do you light this stove too?" asked Saniel, pointing to a small mobile stove in the corner of the fireplace.
- Only at night, so that my servants don't have to get up hour after hour to keep the fire going: we load it in the evening before I fall asleep, we put the pipe in the chimney, and until morning it keeps up a more or less adequate heat.
- I think it would be a good idea to do away with this method of heating, which can have serious disadvantages," says Saniel, "and my colleague and I will shortly be examining the question of whether it would not be possible to give you the heat you need, with this chimney alone, without tiring your servants and without waking you up too often to load the fire. But let's continue.
When he had come to the end of his questions, he got up to examine the patient on her bed, but without turning around her, and so as to remain against the light.
As the reverberation of the setting sun in the sky gradually faded, Balzajette suggested asking for some lamps; without being too hasty in his reply, Saniel refused: there was no need, daylight was enough.
They went into the living room, where they agreed all the more quickly, as Balzajette replied to everything Saniel said:
- I'm glad to see that you share my point of view; that's it, that's it!
They both had their reasons for hurrying: Saniel, fear of the lamps; Balzajette, concern for her dinner. Saniel proposed the treatment, Balzajette approved.
- That's it, that's it!
The question of doing away with the mobile stove was also decided in two words: for the night, we would install a grate in the chimney, fill it with coal and cover it with wet dust, and with this system, used in many small railway stations, we would have fire until the morning.
- Let's go home," said Balzajette, who had initiative and decisiveness in all material matters.
Saniel, who had kept his eyes on the windows, was calm: it was still light enough for lamps not to be needed; moreover, during their tête-à-tête, no servant had crossed the salon to enter Madame Dammauville's house.
But when Balzajette opened the bedroom door to return to the sick woman, a flood of light filled the living room and enveloped them: a lamp with a shade was placed on a small table beside the bed; two other lamps with globes were lit on the mantelpiece, reflecting their light in the mirror.
How could he not have foreseen that there was another door to Madame Dammauville's room other than the one in the living room? But if he had foreseen it, if he had seen the door hidden by the curtain, it would have done nothing to lessen the danger of his situation. He would have found the time to prepare himself, that's all. But what was there to prepare for? Either enter the room and face up to the danger, or flee. He entered.
- This is what we've decided," said Balzajette, who never lost an opportunity to speak up.
While he was speaking, Madame Dammauville did not seem to be listening to him; she had fixed her eyes on Saniel, placed between her and the fireplace so as to turn her back on the lamps, and she was looking at him with a characteristic stare.
Balzajette, who was listening to herself speak, noticed nothing; but Saniel, who knew what was behind that look, could not help but be struck by it; fortunately for him all he had to do was let Balzajette go, which meant that he could not betray himself by the quivering of his voice.
However, Balzajette seemed ready to get to the end of his explanations: all of a sudden Saniel saw Madame Dammauville reach for the lamp on the table and lift the shade, lowering it towards her so as to form a reflector that projected the light onto him; at the same time he received a ray of light in the face.
Madame Dammauville gave a muffled cry.
Balzajette stopped, then his astonished eyes went from Madame Dammauville to Saniel, and from Saniel to Madame Dammauville.
- You're not ill? he said.
- I'm not ill at all.
Then what was the matter? But he rarely asked for an explanation of something that surprised him, preferring to guess and explain it himself.
- Ah, I've got it," he said with a satisfied smile, "you're surprised at the youth of my young colleague. It's his fault; why on earth did he have his long hair and curly beard cut?
If Madame Dammauville hadn't dropped the lampshade, she would have seen Saniel's face discolour and his lips quiver.
- But that's it!" continued Balzajette; "he has made this sacrifice to his new duties: the student has disappeared in front of the teacher.
He could have gone on for a long time: neither Madame Dammauville nor Saniel were listening to him; but, thinking of his dinner, he was not going to launch into a speech that at any other time he would not have failed to make; he rose to withdraw.
As Saniel waved, Madame Dammauville stopped him with a wave of her hand.
- Didn't you know the unfortunate man who was murdered opposite?
However serious an admission this was, Saniel could not respond with a denial.
- I was called in to confirm his death," he said.
And he took a few steps towards the door, but she stopped him again:
- Were you in touch with him?
- I had seen him sometimes.
Balzajette cut this idle conversation short:
- Good evening, dear lady. I'll see you tomorrow, but not in the morning, as I'm leaving for the country at six and won't be back until midday.
XII
- Did you notice how I cut him off?" said Balzajette on the stairs. If you listened to women, they'd never let you go. Damned if I know why she told you about this murdered man! Do you have any idea?
- No, I don't doubt it.
- I think the murder has to some extent scrambled her brains; in any case, it's made her hate this house.
He went on like this without Saniel listening to what he was saying; as he reached the rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, Balzajette hailed a carriage that was passing empty.
- You've been kind enough not to make me late," he said, shaking hands with his young colleague; "but I can see that I'll have to walk fast to get to my dinner, and I don't like to sit at a good table without feeling at my best. Goodbye, then!
What a mess! All this chatter was making Saniel dizzy.
He had to recover, recognise himself, consider the situation and what could, what should, come of it.
It was a simple situation; Madame Dammauville's cry had revealed it: when the light from the lamp had struck him in the face, she had found in him the man she had seen pulling back Caffié's curtains. If, in her astonishment, she had at first refused to believe it, her questions about Caffié, and Balzajette's explanations about the young colleague's long hair and curly beard had destroyed her hesitations and replaced doubt with the horror of certainty: she knew it, she had seen it; and, as she had just revealed herself to him, it did not seem that she would be a woman to deny the testimony of her eyes and to allow the solidity of her memories, supported by the words of Balzajette, to be shaken by simple denials. 
But what he could not see was how she was going to push him into this vertiginous abyss, in other words to whom she would reveal the discovery she had just made: to Philis, to Balzajette, to the law.
It was almost a relief to him to think that for this evening at least it couldn't be Philis, since at this very moment she was supposed to be at his house, anxiously awaiting his return; there was a pain and a revolt in him at the thought that she might be the first to learn the truth. He didn't want that to happen, and he would prevent it.
This concern gave him a purpose; he returned to Rue Louis-le-Grand, thinking more of Philis than of himself. What a disaster when she knew everything! How would she bear this blow and what feelings would it inspire in her, what judgement would she make of the one she loved? The poor girl! He felt sorry for her. He was lost, and it was his fault; he bore the sorrow of his clumsiness; but she would bear the sorrow of her love: what a wound for such a sensitive heart, for such a high and proud soul!
Perhaps he was going to see her for the last time; this hour and nothing more.
So he wanted her to be sweet to him, and to leave him a memory that would later ease his pain, a clear, warm ray in his mourning. He had been hard lately, whimsical, brutal, inexplicable, and, with that serenity of mood that was his very nature, she had not held it against him; when he jostled her with his heavy hand, she had kissed that hand, fixing her beautiful, tender eyes on him, full of passionate caresses. She had to forget that, and take away from their last meeting a tender impression that would sustain her.
What would he do for her? He remembered how happy she had been at their impromptu dinners by the fire six months before and he wanted to give her the same pleasure: he would see her happy again and, next to her, under her gaze, perhaps he would forget the next day.
He went into the restaurant that provided his lunches and ordered two dinners to be brought to his house immediately.
He didn't have to put the key in the lock: Philis was behind the door, listening. When she recognised his footsteps on the landing, she opened the door.
- And what happened?
- Your brother is safe.
- Is Madame Dammauville going to the hearing?
- I promise you he's safe.
- From you?
- Yes, by me... precisely.
In her confusion of joy, she didn't notice the accent of these last words.
- So you forgive me?
He took her in his arms and kissed her with deep emotion:
- With all my heart, I swear!
- You can see that it was written that you would go to Madame Dammauville's, in spite of yourself, in spite of everything; it was providential.
- It's certain that your friend Providence couldn't have intervened in my affairs at a better time.
This time she could not help being struck by the tone he had used in his reply; but she imagined that it was only this allusion to a higher intervention that had upset him.
- I was thinking of us," she said, "not you.
- I understand that. But let's not talk about that; you're happy, I don't want to spoil your joy; on the contrary, I thought I'd join in by surprising you: we're going to have dinner together.
- Oh, dear!" she cried, shivering, "how kind you are!
But then she stopped:
- And Mum waiting anxiously! I can't let her devour herself.
- I'll give your letter to Colliot's boy who's going to bring our dinner up, and he'll send it by messenger.
The letter was quickly delivered.
- Now," said Philis cheerfully, "I'm going to set the table; you light the fire, because we need a nice blaze that will sparkle in the fireplace, cheer us up and keep our dinner warm. What did you order?
- I don't know: two dinners.
- So much the better! We'll have some surprises; we'll leave the dishes covered in front of the fire, and we'll take them at random; maybe we'll eat the roast before the starter; but that'll just make it more fun.
Light, lively and busy, she came and went around the table, graceful and charming.
When the waiter rang the bell, the table was set; Philis gave him her letter and sent him away as quickly as possible, for she was anxious to be face to face with Saniel.
So they sat down at the table in front of the fire, facing each other.
- What a joy to be alone," she said, "to be able to talk and look at each other freely!
He was looking at her with a tenderness she had never seen in his eyes, a depth of emotional contemplation that overwhelmed and devastated her. From time to time, little cries of happiness escaped her:
- Oh, dear, dear," she murmured.
However, she knew him too well not to see that often a cloud of sadness veiled those eyes, so full of love, and that often too they were expressionless, as if they were looking inwards. At first she said nothing, but as time went on, she could not always silence her concern: why this melancholy at a time like this?
- What a difference between this dinner," she said, "and those at the end of October! At that time, you were crushed by the most difficult difficulties, battling with creditors, threatened on all sides, with no tomorrow; and now everything is smoothed out: no more creditors, no more battles, the troubles I imposed on you have come to an end, life opens up easy and glorious, the goal you were pursuing has been achieved, you only have to walk straight ahead, proud and superb. And yet there is a sadness in your face that torments me. What's the matter with you? Please speak. To whom will you confess, if not to the one who adores you?
He stared at her for a long time without answering, wondering whether, for the repose of his heart, this confession would not be better than silence, but his courage failed him, pride closed his lips.
- What do you want from me? If my face is sad, it's because it doesn't accurately reflect what I feel; because what I feel at the moment is an ineffable feeling of tenderness for you, an inexpressible gratitude for your love and for the happiness you have given me. If I've been happy in my rough and tumble life, it's been because of you; whatever good I've had - joy, confidence, hope, memories - I owe to you; and, if we hadn't met, I'd have the right to say that I've been the most miserable of unfortunates. Whatever happens to us, keep these words, my sweet, and take them down to the depths of your heart, where you will find them one day when you want to judge me.
- Judge you, me!
- You love me, you don't know me, but there will come a time when you will want to know the one you have loved: so remember this evening.
- It is too radiant for me to forget.
- Whatever it was, remember it: life is such a fragile and ephemeral thing, and it is beautiful to be able to concentrate it, to sum it up in memory, in an hour that marks it and gives it its significance: that hour is the one that is passing at this moment when I am speaking to you with this moved sincerity.
Philis was not accustomed to such outbursts, for in the rare outpourings he had sometimes indulged in, Saniel had always maintained a certain reserve, as if he feared giving himself away and letting the depths of his nature be read. How often had he mocked her when she sentimentalised, as he put it, and "sang her romance"; and now he was singing it himself, this romance of love.
No matter how happy she was to hear him, she could not help but feel an uneasy astonishment and wonder what melancholy impression he was under at the moment.
He knew how to read her too well not to guess this concern; so, not wanting to betray himself, he brought a smile to her eyes:
- You don't recognise me, do you?" he said, "and I'm sure you're wondering whether I'm ill.
- Oh, dear, don't scoff and stiffen against the feeling that puts such sweet music on your lips: happy, so happy to hear you speak like this that I would like to see your happiness equal to mine, to dispel the dark cloud with which your eyes are veiled. Will you never give up? Especially at this hour when everything is singing and laughing within us and around us! That you were sad six months ago, nothing was more legitimate: it was despair that you could have faced tomorrow; but today what do you lack to be happy?
- Nothing, it's true.
- Isn't this present the radiant morning of a superb future?
- What do you want! There are sad faces, just as there are happy ones: mine is not yours, but let's not talk about that any more, or about the past or the future: let's be in the present.
He got up and, taking her in his arms, sat her down next to him on the sofa.
The ringing of the doorbell startled Saniel as if he'd had a strong electric shock.
- Aren't you going to open the door? I don't want them to take away our evening.
But soon a new, firmer ring put him on his feet.
- The best thing is to know," he said, and went to open the door, leaving Philis in her study.
A chambermaid handed him a letter:
- From Madame Dammauville," she said; "there's a reply.
He left her in the hallway, lit by the open door on the landing, and went back into his study to read the letter: the dream had not lasted long, reality was taking hold of him again with merciless hands; this letter was certain to herald the blow that threatened him.
"If Dr Saniel is free, I beg him to come and see me this evening on urgent business; I shall wait for him until ten o'clock; if not, I expect him tomorrow morning from nine o'clock.
" A. DAMMAUVILLE.
He returned to the hall:
- Tell Madame Dammauville that I shall be with her in a quarter of an hour.
When he returned to his study, he found Philis standing in front of the mirror, putting on her hat.
- I heard," she said. How sad! But I can't blame you, since you're leaving me for Florentin.
As she moved towards the door, he stopped her:
- Kiss me once more.
- He had never held her in such a long, passionate embrace.
XIII
Saniel hadn't had a second's doubt; it wasn't to talk about medicine that Madame Dammauville was calling him, it was to tell him about Caffié, and, in the crisis that had just erupted, he had to tell himself that it was perhaps a good thing that it was so: at least he would be the first to know what she had decided, and then he could defend himself; nothing is hopeless as long as the struggle is possible.
When he rang the bell firmly, the servant who had brought the letter opened the door and, with a small lamp in her hand, led him through the dining room and the sitting room into Madame Dammauville's bedroom.
As soon as he reached the threshold, a glance showed him that the layout of the room had changed: the little bed, on which he had seen Madame Dammauville, was tucked away between the two windows, and she was lying in a large four-poster bed with dark curtains; beside her was a fairly large table on which was placed a lamp with a lampshade, books, a blotter, a teapot and a cup; The fire in the fireplace was out, but the mobile stove radiated a heat that told her it had been charged for the night. 
This warmth seized Saniel, who mechanically unbuttoned his overcoat.
- If the heat bothers you, please get rid of your overcoat," said Madame Dammauville.
As he placed it and his hat on an armchair beside the fireplace, he heard Madame Dammauville say to her chambermaid:
- Stay in the sitting room and warn the cook not to go to bed.
What did this recommendation mean? Was she afraid he would cut her neck?
- Would you like to come closer to my bed," she said, "so that we can talk without raising our voices, which is important.
He took a chair and sat down at a certain distance from the bed, so as not to be in the circle of light from the lamp; then he waited.
A moment of silence, which he found terribly long, passed before she spoke.
- You know," she said at last, "how chance made me see from this place -- she pointed to one of the windows in her room -- the face of the murderer of my unfortunate tenant, M. Caffié.
- Mademoiselle Cormier told me," he replied in his usual conversational tone.
- You may be surprised that at such a distance I could see that face well enough to see it again after five months as if I were still looking at it.
- This is indeed extraordinary.
- Not for those who have a memory for faces and attitudes, but in my case this memory has always been very well developed. I still remember my childhood friends, and I see them as they were when I was six or ten, without any confusion in my mind.
- Childhood impressions are generally vivid and persistent.
- This persistence does not only apply to my youthful impressions: today, I do not forget or confuse a physiognomy any more than I did in the past. Perhaps, if I had had many acquaintances and had seen a large number of people every day, this confusion would have become established, but this is not my case, the fragility of my health has forced me to lead a secluded life, and there is no one with whom I have had relations, even fleeting ones, that my eyes do not remember. When I think of someone, it's not primarily their name that comes to mind, but their physiognomy. Whenever I have been in the Senate or the House, I have not had to ask the names of the deputies or senators who were speaking; when I had seen their portraits, I certainly recognised them. If I go into these details, it is because they are of great importance, as you will see.
He didn't need her to point out this importance, he understood it only too well.
- Well, that's just the way I am," she continued, "so it's not surprising that the face and appearance of the man who drew the curtains in M. Caffié's study have not escaped my memory; you admit that, don't you?
- Since you are consulting me, I must tell you that the operations of memory are not as simple as we imagine them to be in the world; they comprise three things: the conservation of certain states, their reproduction and their localisation in the past, which must be brought together to constitute perfect memory. But this combination does not always take place, and often the third is missing.
- I don't quite understand; what is this third thing?
- Recognition.
- Well, I can assure you that in the case before me, it is not lacking.
Since the action had begun in this way, it was of the utmost importance for Saniel to cast doubts in Madame Dammauville's mind and lead her to believe that the memory she was so sure of was perhaps not as solid or as perfect as she imagined.
- It is precisely that," he said, "this third thing is the most delicate and the most complex of the three, since it presupposes, in addition to the principal state of consciousness, secondary states varying in number and degree which, grouped around it, determine it.
Madame Dammauville remained silent for a moment and Saniel saw that she was making an effort to focus her mind on these obscure words:
- I don't understand," she said at last.
This was precisely what he wanted; however, as it would not have been clever to suggest that he was trying to deceive or stupefy her, he thought he could be a little more precise:
- I want to ask you," he continued, "if you are sure that there has been no confusion between the mechanism of vision and that of recognition, which is a vision in time.
She drew a breath, obviously satisfied to be out of these subtleties that were troubling her.
- It's precisely because I admit the possibility of this confusion, at least in part, that I called you," she said, "so that you could establish it.
Saniel didn't seem to understand:
- Me, madam.
- Yourself. A few hours ago, when you came with Mr Balzajette, you couldn't have failed to notice that I was examining you in an unnatural way. Before the lamps were lit, and when your back was to daylight, I was looking for where I had seen you before, but I couldn't find it. I was sure that you bore some resemblance to a face I knew, but the name to put on that face eluded me. When you returned and I saw you better in the light of the lamps, my memories became clearer; I lifted the lampshade, the light hit you full on and then your eyes, so characteristic, at the same time as a violent contraction of your face, shouted this name to me: this physiognomy, these eyes, this face belonged to the man that, from this place, -- she pointed to the window, -- I saw draw the curtains of M. Caffié.
Saniel did not flinch.
- That's a resemblance that would be unfortunate for me," he said, "if your memory was accurate.
- I said to myself that it might not be, and after an initial gasp of surprise, I confirmed myself in this thought by noticing that you were not wearing the big hair and the long blond beard that the man who had drawn the curtains had; but at that very moment Mr Balzajette spoke of this beard and this hair that you had had cut; I was crushed; nevertheless I had the strength to ask you if you had been in contact with Mr Caffié. Do you remember your answer?
- Yes, I do.
- After you left, I was left in a state of cruel anguish: it was you that I had seen draw the curtains, and it couldn't have been you. I tried to think of what I should do: notify the police, ask you for an interview. For a long time I wavered over my decision. Finally, I decided to talk to you. I wrote to you.
- I answered your call; but I confess that I don't know how to respond to this strange communication; you think you recognise in me the man who drew the curtains.
- I do recognise you.
- So what do you want me to say: you're not asking me for a consultation?
She thought she understood the meaning of this reply and guessed its purpose:
- It's not about me," she replied, "it's not about my moral state or my mental state, it's about you: my eyes, my memory, my conscience are making a terrible accusation against you: I can't believe my eyes or my memory, I reject my conscience, and I'm asking you to make this accusation null and void.
- And how, madam?
- Oh, not by protest.
- ... How can you expect a man in my position to stoop to discussing accusations based on a hallucination?
- Do you think I'm hallucinating? If so, call in one of your colleagues for a consultation tomorrow; if he believes as you do, I'll submit; if not, I'll remain convinced that I saw, and saw well, and I'll act accordingly.
- If you have seen correctly, madam, and I am prepared to concede this to you, it is because there is someone in the world who is my double; these extraordinary resemblances exist, you know that.
- I told myself so, and it was precisely this idea that made me write to you; I wanted to give you the opportunity to prove that you could not be that man.
- You will agree that I find it difficult to discuss such an accusation.
- One can find oneself accused by a combination of fatal circumstances and still be innocent, like this unfortunate boy who has been imprisoned for five months for a crime of which he is not guilty; and I start from your innocence as well as his to ask you to show that the charges brought against you are false.
- There are no charges against me.
- There may not be; that depends on you. For example, your hair and beard may already have been cut at the time of the murder: then it is quite certain that the man I saw was not you, and that I am a hallucinating woman. Were they or weren't they?
- They weren't; I had them cut off a few days ago to recover from a contagious disease.
- It may be," she continued, without seeming touched by this explanation, "that on the day of the murder, at the time I saw you, you were somewhere busy, so as to prove that you could not have been in the Rue Sainte-Anne at the same time, and that I was the victim of an hallucination; Finally, it is still possible that at that moment your situation was not that of a desperate man, fatally driven to crime by poverty or ambition, and that, consequently, it was not in your interest to commit this desperate crime. What do I know? Twenty other means of defence may be in your hands.
- You cited the example of this poor boy who is imprisoned even though he is innocent. Would it not apply to me if you did not recognise the error of your eyes or of your memory: would he not be condemned without your testimony; would I not be condemned if I did not find one that would nullify your accusation; and I do not know who to ask for this testimony. Have you thought of the infamy with which such an accusation will cover me? If I reject it, and I will reject it, will it not have disgraced me, lost me forever?
- It is precisely because I thought of this that I called you, so that by an explanation that you should give me, it seemed to me, you would prevent me from communicating this accusation to the law. You won't give me this explanation, so all I have to do now is think about the man whose innocence has been proven to me, and defend him against the man whose guilt has been proven to me no less.
- You won't do that.
- My duty obliges me to do so, and whatever may happen, I have always obeyed my duty: for me, in this horrible affair, there is an innocent and a guilty party involved; I side with the innocent.
- I can prove to you that it was an aberration of vision...
- You can prove it to the courts: they will decide.
He stood up violently; she put her hand on the doorbell; they looked at each other for a moment and what their lips did not express, their eyes said: -- I do not fear you, my precautions are taken. -- This bell will not save you.
Finally, he spoke in a hoarse, trembling voice:
- You are responsible for what is going to happen, madam.
- I accept it before God," she said with calm firmness. Defend yourself.
He went to the armchair on which he had laid his overcoat, and stooping to pick it up, quietly turned the key to the stove.
At the same time Madame Dammauville pulled the doorbell; the chambermaid opened the sitting room door.
- Show Dr Saniel out.
XIV
On his way home, Saniel fell back on his sofa in a daze, and without even lighting a candle, he remained there, devastated.
What was appalling was the speed with which he had condemned this poor woman to death and, without hesitation, executed her: for him to be saved, she had to die: she would die. This time, the idea had not twisted and turned as it had for Caffié, going from one contradiction to another, taking him through successive stages that had made him accustomed to it; was it only the first crime that costs, and, on the road he had entered, would he go all the way, sowing corpses behind him?
He shuddered from head to toe at the thought that this victim might not be the last that his salvation would require. When she had threatened to call the law on him, he had only believed her threat: if she spoke, he would be lost; he had kept his mouth shut. But hadn't that mouth already opened before he closed it, hadn't it already spoken? Before deciding to have this conversation, she could have told everything to the people around her who, between the time he left with Balzajette and the time he returned, had visited her or whom she had asked to consult her. So those were also condemned to death?
A pointless crime, or a series of crimes.
The horror that seized him was so strong that he thought of running to Rue Sainte-Anne; he would wake up the sleeping house, have the doors opened, break the window panes, save it ; But since he had gone out until that moment, the carbonic acid and carbon monoxide had had time to produce asphyxiation, and he would certainly arrive after death, or else, if he found her still alive, it would be because they had noticed that the stove key had been turned, and by appearing in this way for no reason, he was betraying himself as surely as by a confession. 
After all, it was possible that they would have seen that the key had been turned, and even the odds were in their favour; then she would have been saved and he lost: chance would have decided between them.
It was a solution like any other, and the good thing about it was that it eluded him: come what may. There are times when the shipwrecked man, tired of swimming, not knowing which way to turn, without a lighthouse, without direction, at the end of his strength and hope, makes a plank and lets himself be tossed about, the plaything of the waves, to rest and wait for a break in the weather - in his case, all he had to do was wait; everything else would be sterile and dangerous agitation.
He was not going to repeat the folly of trying to foresee and know as he had done with Caffié; he would always know soon enough, whatever the result, too soon.
Rising to his feet, he lit a candle and began to walk through his flat, turning on himself, coming and going like a beast in a menagerie; then the idea came to him that his footsteps should be heard below him; No doubt people would notice his restless walking, be surprised, and look for explanations, and in his situation he had to be careful not to give in to any remarks that were not naturally self-explanatory; and it's not natural for people to walk around at night with jerky steps instead of sleeping soundly in their beds. He took off his boots and, as he couldn't sit still, he resumed his whirling, his neck tucked into his shoulders, his back tense, his arms flailing.
But why had she told him about the double beading on the doors and windows, the drapes on the walls, the thick curtains? It was she who had suggested the idea of the stove key, which would not have occurred to him spontaneously. If he admitted the influence of chance, there was certainly a very characteristic one, which, to a certain extent, freed him.
Sometimes he felt that the time was not right, that morning would never come, sometimes, on the contrary, he felt that it was slipping away from him with astonishing rapidity; at times, sweat fell from his forehead onto his hands; at others, he felt frozen.
When dawn began to whiten the windows, he returned to the sofa, sitting down, shivering and overwhelmed. He leaned back against a cushion and caught the scent of Philis; then, burying his head in it, he lay there motionless and fell asleep.
A ring of the doorbell woke him, and he found himself on his feet, frightened, not knowing where he was. It was daylight; cars were driving down the street. The doorbell rang a second time, louder and more hurriedly. He went to open the door, shivering, and recognised the chambermaid who had brought him Madame Dammauville's letter the day before. He didn't need to question her: chance had sided with him. His eyes blurred; it was without seeing her that he heard the chambermaid explain what had brought her.
- She had been at Mr Balzajette's, but he had just left for the country, so she had come running: her mistress was almost cold in bed, not speaking, not breathing, but with a rosy face.
- I'll go with you.
He didn't need to know any more: this pinkish colouring, which is noticeable in asphyxiation by carbon monoxide, had fixed him. However, on the way, walking quickly beside her in the still deserted streets, he asked her what had happened after she left:
- Nothing had happened; she had talked in the kitchen with the cook who, around midnight, had gone up to her room on the fifth floor, and she had then gone to bed in a study adjoining her mistress's room. During the night, she had heard nothing; in the morning, at daybreak, she had found her mistress in the state she had just described, and she had immediately run to Mr Balzajette.
Continuing his interrogation, he wanted to know what Madame Dammauville had done since her consultation with Mr Balzajette.
- She had eaten dinner as usual, but less than usual, eating almost nothing; then she had received a visit from one of her friends who had stayed only a few minutes, leaving on a trip.
This was exactly what he had feared: Madame Dammauville had opened up to this friend. If that was the case, then his crime would be pointless; how far would it take him?
After a few moments, and in a tone that he tried to make indifferent, he asked who this friend was.
- A childhood friend, Madame Thézard, living at No. 9 rue des Capucines, the wife of a consul.
All the way to the house in the rue Sainte-Anne, he kept repeating the name and address to himself, a name he couldn't write down, but which he couldn't let his troubled head forget, because that was where the danger would come from if Madame Dammauville had spoken.
He had long been accustomed to the spectacle of death, but when he found himself face to face with this woman lying on her bed as if asleep, a contraction shook him.
- Give me a mirror and a candle," he said to the chambermaid and the cook, who were standing at the door of the living room without daring to enter.
While they searched, one for the mirror, the other for the candle, he went to the stove: the key remained as he had turned it the day before; he opened it and returned to bed.
It didn't take him long to examine her: she had succumbed to asphyxiation caused by the coal fumes. Was the poor draught due to the construction of the stove or a defect in the chimney? That would be for the inquest to decide; as far as he was concerned, all he could do was confirm death.
When Philis left him the day before, she had told him she would come early the next morning to find out what Madame Dammauville wanted. When he told her that she was dead, she went into a desperate prostration: Florentin was lost.
He tried to reassure her, but without success; she had put too much hope in his testimony to accept the catastrophe that was taking it away from them.
Nougarède didn't accept it either, and his disappointment was compounded by regret: if he had done things differently and followed the normal procedure, this testimony would now be in Florentin's favour.
However, he tried to reassure Philis: in short, the prosecution was only relying on the button and the struggle that had pulled it off. Saniel would destroy this hypothesis: he had to be counted on.
Saniel thus once again became, as he had been until Madame Dammauville's intervention, the supreme hope of Philis and Madame Cormier:
- When I have proved that there was no struggle, the hypothesis of the torn button will collapse on its own.
- And if it still stands, how and with what will we bring it down?
If he had shown himself as he was before, she would have shared the confidence he tried to inspire in her; but since Madame Dammauville's death, such great changes had taken place in him that she could not help worrying. Obviously it was the disappearance of Madame Dammauville that had made his mood so sombre and his temper so irritable that no one could object to him: he saw the dangers of the situation that this disappearance had created for Florentin, and, with his usual generosity, he reproached himself for not having agreed to look after Madame Dammauville sooner; he would certainly have saved her, since he had first asked for the removal of this stove, and Florentin would have been saved too.
Finally the day of the hearing arrived, without Saniel having heard anything about Madame Thézard, which proved that Madame Dammauville had said nothing to her friend. In the six months since the murder, the case had lost some of its interest for the Parisian public; in the provinces it was still talked about, but in Paris it had already been discounted for a long time: a clerk who cuts off his boss's neck to rob him lacks romance; no woman, no mystery. So the president, who loved beautiful rooms, had been annoyed not to see himself swamped with requests: his room was full, but not too full.
Saniel would have liked Philis to stay with Madame Cormier; but she had insisted, in spite of his observations and prayers, on coming to the hearing: she had to be there, Florentin had to see her, take courage from her eyes; he would defend himself better if he felt supported.
He defended himself badly, or at least weakly, without conviction, like a man who gives in because he knows in advance that everything he says will be useless.
Until Saniel's deposition, the witnesses who came forward were rather insignificant and revealed nothing that was not known; only Valerius, with his claims to professional secrecy, which he developed at length, amused the audience. But then Nougarède rose and asked the president to ask the witness to explain the struggle that had taken place between the victim and his assassin; and the president, who had begun by arguing, had to decide to ask this question in the face of the insistence of the defence. Saniel then explained at length how, from the position of the corpse in the chair and its condition, there was scientific proof that the struggle had not occurred.
- That's an opinion," said the president curtly; "the jury will decide.
- Perfectly," replied Nougarède, "and I reserve the right to make the jurors feel the weight it lends to the authority of the person who formulated it.
This effective sentence was intended to negate in advance the contradictions that the prosecution would, he believed, raise against this testimony; but these contradictions did not arise, and Saniel was able to take his place next to Philis without being called back to the stand to support his opinion against a doctor whose scientific authority was opposed to his own.
In the absence of Madame Dammauville, Nougarède had summoned the concierge of the rue Sainte-Anne, as well as the chambermaid and the cook, who had heard their mistress say that the man who had drawn Caffié's curtains did not resemble Florentin's portrait; but these were only rumours repeated by unimportant people, who could not produce the effect of the coup de théâtre on which he had based his defence.
When the public prosecutor delivered his indictment, it became clear why Saniel's opinion that there had been no struggle had not been contradicted; although the prosecution believed that there had been a struggle, it was willing to abandon it for a moment, since it did not need this hypothesis to prove that the button had not been torn off by falling from a ladder: it had been torn off in the very act of murder, in the effort to cut the neck of the victim who had violently stretched out his right arm and, by the jolt to the shoulder strap, torn off the button. The effect of Saniel's testimony was therefore destroyed, as was the much less powerful effect produced by the testimony of Madame Dammauville's servants, when the public prosecutor demonstrated that these rumours turned against the accused: it was said that she had seen a man with long hair and a curly beard draw the curtains; well, didn't this description apply to the accused? In truth, it was reported that she had not found him in a portrait published by an illustrated newspaper. Well, the portrait was not a likeness. Besides, was it plausible to admit that a woman of Madame Dammauville's character would not have warned the law if she had thought her testimony important and decisive? The proof that she herself had recognised its insignificance lay in the fact that she had kept it quiet.
Nougarède's plea, however eloquent, had not destroyed these two arguments, nor had it erased the impression made by the businessman's testimony about the theft of the forty-five francs, and the jury had returned an affirmative verdict, ruling out premeditation and admitting extenuating circumstances.
On hearing the verdict condemning Florentin to twenty years' hard labour, Philis, suffocated, clung to Saniel's arm; but he could not look after her as he would have liked, for Brigard, who had come to the hearing to witness the triumph of his disciple, had just approached him:
- Please accept my congratulations on your deposition, my dear; it is an act of courage that does you great credit. If this poor boy could have been saved, it was by you: you can say what you like, you are the man of conscience.
Part Three
I
During his first years in Paris, Saniel had published an article on Shakespeare's Pharmacy in a youth magazine in the Latin Quarter: The poison in Hamlet, the poison in Romeo and Juliet; and although, since his choice of medicine, he had read little more than science books, he had at that time had to study the theatre of his author; from this study there had remained in his memory a phrase which, for ten years, had never returned to his lips, and which suddenly imposed itself on his memory with the exasperating persistence of a tune once heard and repeated, -- that of Macbeth: "Macbeth has killed sleep, sleep, innocent, death of every day's life, bath of painful labour, balm of wounded souls. "
This sentence was the translation of a particular state he was going through: he too had lost "this innocent sleep, the bath of painful work, the balm of wounded souls". He had never been a great sleeper, at least in that he had imposed on himself the habit, hard at the beginning, less painful as he continued, of spending only a few hours in bed; but he used these few hours well, sleeping like the tired, fists closed, without dreams or waking up: The side on which he lay down was the side on which he opened his eyes, and the thought that occupied his mind in the evening was the first thought he had in the morning, not having been chased away by other thoughts or dreams. 
After Caffié's death, this tranquil and restorative sleep had continued just as calmly and just as solidly; but suddenly, after Madame Dammauville's death, it had been interrupted.
At first, he didn't mind: he wasn't asleep, so much the better! he would work more. But you can't always work any more than you can always go without eating. Saniel knew better than anyone that the life of any organ is made up of alternating periods of rest and activity: one during which the organ renews its supply of nutritive materials, the other during which it consumes these materials in the development of living forces, and he did not imagine that he could work indefinitely without sleeping: only he believed that after twenty-hour days of work, crushed with fatigue, he would nevertheless have four hours of complete sleep, the sleep that Shakespeare called the bath of painful work.
He didn't get those four hours, and the law that says that any state of prolonged excitement leads to exhaustion, which must be remedied by functional rest, was wrong for him. When, after his long days of work, at about one or two in the morning, when all the sounds of life had ceased in the house and in the street, and weariness was reflected in the inertia of the muscles that allowed his head to droop on his chest and his eyelids to droop over his blurred eyes, he went to bed, walking carefully, undressing slowly and smoothly, and fell asleep without delay in his sheets. But almost immediately, and very often, he would wake up with a start, suffocated, covered in sweat, in a state of extreme anxiety, his mind agitated by hallucinations that he could not immediately shake off. Then his sleep was over for a long time, despite his general need for it; or if, after tossing and turning on his bed, he managed to fall back asleep, it was never the complete and deep sleep he used to have; Some parts of his brain were still awake and, if their excitation did not cause him to wake up suddenly, they produced dreams that were more painful for him, because he was aware of them, he followed them, examined them without being able to detach himself from them, get rid of them, wake up completely, their plaything, their victim : and they were terrible, these dreams, always the same, leaving Madame Dammauville only to take him back to Caffié. Wasn't it strange that Caffié, who until then had been completely erased from her memory, dead as he really was, had found himself resurrected by Madame Dammauville, and only at night, the spectre of the shadow that the day dissipated?
Believing that one of the causes of this excitability of the brain could well be the mental work he was imposing on it in excessive doses, at precisely the time when this excitability should not have been prolonged but, on the contrary, numbed, he had decided to change a system that had worked so badly for him: instead of intellectual work, he would do material work, which, by exhausting his muscular functions, would give him the sleep of the poor people who toiled all day, labourers or diggers, carters or lumberjacks, and as he couldn't roll the wheelbarrow or split the wood, he had started, every evening after dinner, to walk straight ahead at an accelerated pace, doing his seven or eight leagues before going home: he would certainly get the better of this reactive brain. 
The physical work had been no more successful than the spiritual work; he had been able to give himself the fatigue of the diggers and lumberjacks, but not their sleep. When he went to bed with his legs broken, his feet aching, slumped by his long, hurried walk, he had the same startled awakenings, the same painful dreams that panicked and exhausted him. Decidedly, the fatigue of the body was no better than that of the brain. And even less so. At his desk, immersed in his books, or in his laboratory, bent over his microscope, he absorbed himself in the task in hand and, by the strength of a will that had been exercised for a long time and submitted to obedience, he managed to keep his mind focused on the subject in hand, without distraction or daydreams. But when he walked through the streets of Paris, on the deserted roads of the suburbs, across the fields or through the woods, along the Seine or the Marne, his free thought ran where it wished; he did not command it; it was the mistress, and it always led him back to Madame Dammauville, to Caffié, to Florentin : It seemed as if the heat of walking put pressure on his brain like the boiler of a machine, which then carried him along, without any possible brake, without any direction, vertiginously. When he returned in this state, after several hours of cerebral excitability, how would he have found the peaceful and restorative sleep, complete and deep, of poor people who have only worked their muscles?
Having never been ill, he had never had to examine or treat himself: medicine was good for others, useless for him! With an organised machine like his, all he had to fear were accidents, and so far he had been spared them; like the true son of a farmer that he was, he had victoriously resisted both the life of Paris and the overwork of the mind. But the time had come to give himself up to this examination, and to try a treatment that would give him rest: he was not a sceptical doctor, and he believed that the remedies he had prescribed for others were good for him.
The unfortunate thing was that he had none of the causes of insomnia: he had neither meningitis nor encephalitis, nor anything to suggest a brain tumour; he was not anaemic; he ate; he suffered from no neuralgia or any of the acute or chronic ailments that generally accompany the absence of sleep; he drank neither coffee nor alcohol, and, without this state of overexcitability of the encephalic centres, he could have said that he was in good health, only a little emaciated, but that was all. 
It was this excitation that he had to cure, and as there are classic remedies for insomnia, he had used the one that seemed to suit his condition; but potassium bromide, despite its hypnotic properties, had produced no more effect than intellectual or physical overwork. Recognising its ineffectiveness, he had replaced it with chloral; but chloral, which after a few days' use should have created a particular disposition to sleep, had failed just like potassium bromide. So he tried morphine injections.
It was not without some trepidation that he came to this third attempt, the first two having been so unsuccessful, and, since it is known that chloral produces a calmer sleep than morphine, it seemed that it would fail again; nevertheless he had slept without being tormented by the awakenings and dreams that were the terror of his short nights, and the next day he had slept again.
But he knew too well the effects produced by the prolonged use of these injections to continue them beyond what was strictly necessary; he had therefore wanted to interrupt them: sleep had again abandoned him. He resumed them; then, as the primitive doses lost their effectiveness, he gradually increased them. After a while, what he should have feared and what he did fear had come true: his weight had increased; he had lost his appetite, his muscular strength and his moral energy; his pale face had begun to take on the expression so characteristic of morphine addicts.
Then he stopped in horror.
If he continued, he would indeed become a morphine addict within a given time, and the apathy into which he fell would prevent him from resisting the need to absorb new doses of poison, a need as imperious and irresistible in morphine addiction as that of alcohol is for the alcoholic, and more terrible in its effects: the perversion of the intellectual faculties, the loss of willpower, memory and judgement, paralysis or mania leading to suicide.
If he did not continue, those sleepless nights or restless sleeps that had distressed him would return, followed by a return of that over-excitability of the brain which, by disturbing the nutrition of the encephalic mass, could be the prelude to some serious cerebral disorder.
On the one hand, mania due to morphine; on the other, dementia due to constant and disordered excitability of the brain: that was what awaited him.
Between a result that was inevitably certain and one that was only possible, he had no choice: he had to give up morphine; and this choice was all the more compelling because, while morphine ensured that he slept at night, it did nothing to give him peace of mind during the day -- quite the contrary.
When he had begun to use this remedy, it was only during the night that he fell under the influence of certain ideas; during the day, by applying himself to his work and maintaining his tense application by an effort of will, he escaped these ideas: he was the man he had always been, master of his strength and his thoughts. But the action of the morphine had soon weakened his hitherto omnipotent will, so that when these ideas had crossed his mind during the day, he no longer had the energy to chase them away. He tried to shake them off, but to no avail; they would not let themselves be detached from his brain, to which they clung and which they invaded with a profuse expansion.
In truth, these two corpses were horribly bothering him. Wasn't it exasperating, for a man who had seen so much and butchered so many, that there were only two of them always before his eyes, even when they were closed -- that of this old rascal and that of this unfortunate woman? So as not to compound this impression with another that humiliated him, he had got rid of the bundles of banknotes taken from Caffié's house by sending them 'as restitution' to the director of Public Assistance; but this had had no appreciable effect.
He was also obsessed by the thought of Florentin, and while he could see Caffié slumped in his blood-soaked armchair and Madame Dammauville motionless and pink on her bed, it was no less cruel for him to see Florentin in the steerage of the transport that would soon take him to New Caledonia.
The ideas he had expressed to Crozat about conscience, and those he had explained to Philis about remorse, were still his own; but he was no less certain that these two dead men and this condemned man weighed terribly heavily on him, frightening and suffocating like the epialte of a nightmare: it was neither his upbringing nor his milieu to have these corpses behind you and this victim in front of you.
But where his old ideas had been turned upside down, since these deaths had seized his life, was in his confidence in his own strength.
The strong man he had believed himself to be, the one who walks straight to his goal, without concern for anything or anyone, looking only ahead and never behind, master of his mind as well as his heart and his arm, was not at all the man reality had revealed.
On the contrary, he had been weak in action, and even weaker afterwards.
And it was not only a humiliation in the present that he felt at recognising this weakness, it was also a worry for the future: for, if he did not have this strength that he had attributed to himself before having experienced its power, he would, if his beliefs were true, one day succumb with the weak.
Obviously, if he had been completely strong, he would not have complicated his life with a love: the strong go it alone, because they don't need anyone; and he needed a woman, so much that it was through her alone, close to her, when he looked at her, when he listened to her, that he felt a little calm.
Was he therefore weak and a coward? No, perhaps, but simply human.
II
Precisely because he felt calm with Philis, Saniel wanted her not to leave him.
But however happy she was, in her grief, to see that instead of moving away from her - which a less generous man might have done - he was trying to get closer to her every day, she could not give up her lessons and her work, which were their very life, to give all her time to her love, any more than she could always leave alone her grief-stricken mother, who had never needed to be lifted up and supported as much as she did now.
She didn't spend a day without coming to see him; but, as much as she wanted to, she couldn't stay with him for as long as she would have liked and as he himself asked. When she got up to leave and he stopped her, she didn't leave, but they were never more than a few minutes saved: they were short, and soon came the time when, after going over it ten times, she had to leave him.
These separations had always been despairs for her, the apprehension of which from the moment of arrival paralysed her; but now they were even crueller. In the past, when she left him, she often saw him already immersed in his work before she had drawn the door; now, on the contrary, he led her into the hallway, held her back, and only let her go down the stairs when she had torn herself away from his embrace, after she had promised and repeated to come early the next day and stay longer with him. In the past, too, she had been at peace when she went away, not having to worry about his health or how she would find him again: solid and valiant as usual, as sound in body as in mind, that was certain. On the contrary, now she had the worry of trying to predict, each time she arrived, how he would be: would the sadness, the melancholy, the despondency persist that day; would his weight loss and his paleness increase? It was his worry, his anguish, to try to guess the causes of the changes that had taken place in him, and which were so evident in everything, in his feelings as well as in his person. Wasn't it really extraordinary that he should be more gloomy or more worried, now that his life was assured, than at such a hard time when it was threatened without him ever knowing what his tomorrow would be? His experiments had produced better results than he could have hoped for, he himself agreed; the studies he had just published on these experiments were hotly debated, praised by some, contested by others; it seemed to him that he had achieved his goal, and he was chagrined, discontented, unhappy, more tormented than when he was exhausting himself in his efforts, with no other support than his will. Finally when, frightened to see him like this, she asked him what he was feeling, he got angry and replied brutally:
- Sick? Why do you want me to be ill? Aren't I in a better position than anyone to know what's wrong with me? I overworked myself, that's all; and, as my life of deprivation didn't allow me to repair my strength, I ended up anaemic. It's really strange that you should go looking for extraordinary explanations for what is natural and, in a way, obligatory: count the teeth of polytechnicians and look at their hair after their exams, and tell me what you think. Why should I be any different? You can't spend your money with impunity, that would be too good; everything in this world has to be paid for. Only the bourgeois earn their fortune by playing cards or dominoes on café tables and rolling billiard balls, which allows them to be amiable and well-groomed.
She had to believe that he was right and could see through her condition, but she couldn't help tormenting herself. She didn't know anything about medicine, she didn't know what overwork and the anaemia that resulted from it were, but she felt that anaemia wasn't enough to explain everything, any more than his sudden mood swings and fits of anger about nothing, than his bursts of tenderness, his breakdowns and his despondency, his preoccupations and his absences.
By the very fact that she was observing him closely, she had noticed very well the effect she was having on him, and how, by her very presence, she was brightening up his gloomy mood and relieving his despondency, on the sole condition that she did not ask him awkward questions on certain subjects which she had not yet managed to determine, but which she hoped to avoid. So she wished she could never leave his side, and did her utmost to create opportunities for him to come and see her up to twice a day, in the morning on her way to lessons, and in the afternoon or evening on some pretext: he was so happy when she surprised him!
One evening, late, she rang his doorbell with a hand that was nervous with joy.
- I've come to stay until tomorrow," she said in a triumphant voice.
She expected him to respond to her joy with an embrace of happiness, but he did not.
- Do you have to go out?
- Not at all; it's not me I'm thinking about, it's your mother.
- Do you think I would have left her alone in her present state of nervous and moral weakness, afraid of everything? A cousin arrived from the provinces who is going to sleep in my bed, and I quickly took advantage of the situation to say that I would be staying at the boarding house. And here I am.
Despite the desire he had had more than once, he had never dared ask her to give him the night off; during the day, he only betrayed himself by his chagrined or whimsical mood; but at night, with the hallucinated sleep that was his, wouldn't he betray himself by some serious word that escaped him?
However, since she had come, it was impossible to send her away; he could do it neither for her nor for himself. What pretext could he find to say: "Go away; I don't want you"? He wanted her: he wanted to look at her, listen to her, hear her voice, which lulled and numbed his anguish, feel her close to him, just to have her there and not be face to face with his thoughts.
On the sly, she examined him, wondering about the reason for this strange welcome, standing in the study where she had entered after him, not daring to get rid of her hat. How could her arrival have produced such a different effect from the one she had expected when she had come in so happy and light?
- Aren't you taking off your hat?
- I was wondering if you didn't have to work.
- Why did you wonder that?
- For fear of disturbing you.
- What rage is it that you always ask yourself something? What are you looking for in me? Who surprises you? Why are you bothering me? Why? Come on, speak up once and for all: explain yourself.
It was a long time ago that these explosions stunned her, but they still distressed her, and each time they broke out, even more: how irritable and worried he was! But she no longer let her pain and surprise show.
- I've been clumsy explaining myself again," she said. What do you want? I'm like that; forgive me.
This single word, "Forgive me", was crueler to him than any reproach, for he knew that he had nothing to forgive her for, since she was the victim and he was the guilty party. Would he never be able to control such reckless and unjust outbursts?
He took her in his arms and made her sit next to him:
- It's up to you to forgive.
He was mad to imagine that she might be suspicious, and the surest way to arouse suspicion was precisely to show fear that she might be; betraying himself by these clumsinesses was as serious as letting a complaint or a confession slip out while he was asleep.
Besides, for this night he had found a way, which in reality was not very difficult, of not exposing himself to talking in his sleep: it was not to sleep; when sleep overtook him, he would make sure he stayed awake. After spending so many nights without closing his eyes, he would no doubt keep them open all night.
But he was mistaken; when he heard Philis's calm, regular breathing, and felt the gentle warmth of her shoulder, where she had rested her head, penetrate him, in the immobility he had imposed on himself without noticing it, believing himself to be far from sleep and convinced that he had no effort to make to avoid succumbing to it, he suddenly fell asleep.
When he awoke, a pale ray of sunlight filled one corner of the room; leaning on the bolster, Philis was watching him.
He made a sudden movement and threw himself back.
- What is it?" he cried. What did I say?
Instantly his face paled, his lips quivered; he felt his heart beat tumultuously and his throat tighten with a painful constriction.
- But there's nothing there," she replied, looking at him tenderly, "you didn't say anything.
In fact, why would he have said anything? There was no reason for it, apart from his very fear of betraying himself: in his troubled sleep, under the fright of his hallucinations, he might have moaned, shouted, spoken, but he didn't know if he had really ever shouted or spoken, as no one had ever been near him to observe and hear him. Besides, he had not just awoken from one of his restless slumbers; at least there was nothing in him to indicate that he had been agitated. In spite of his confusion and fright, these reflections had formed instantly in his mind, and his face had relaxed.
- What time is it now?
- Nearly six.
- Six o'clock!
- Can't you hear the cars in the street? The pierrots are chirping.
It must have been about one o'clock when his eyes closed; so he had slept for five hours, and a deep, complete sleep, the kind he had sought for so long without obtaining it, "the balm of afflicted souls, the bath of painful labour", and he emerged from this bath, calm, rested, rejuvenated, his body at the ready, his mind at ease, in all the man he had once been in his years of happy youth, and not the man of these last frightfully hard times.
A sigh swelled in his free chest.
- Ah, if I still had you," he murmured, addressing these words to himself as much as to her.
And he fixed a long gaze on her, in which shone an emotional smile; then, wrapping an arm around her shoulders, he drew her against him.
- Dear little woman!
Never before had she felt such deep, vibrant tenderness in his voice; never before had she been able, as she did when she heard those three words, to measure the greatness of the love she inspired in him, and it even seemed to be the declaration of a new love.
Hugging her passionately, he repeated:
- Dear little woman!
Distraught, she answered nothing, shattered by her happiness.
Suddenly, he gently pushed her aside and looked at her with the same smile:
- Doesn't that word mean anything to you?
- It tells me that you love me.
- Is that all?
- What more could I want? You say it, I feel it, you give me the greatest joy I could ever dream of.
- Is that enough for you?
- It would be enough for me if it didn't have to be interrupted: but it is the misfortune of our lives that we have to separate when the ties that bind us are most strained.
- Why separate?
- Alas! What about Mum? What about life?
- If you didn't leave your mother; if you didn't have to worry about your life.
She looked at him, not daring to question him, betraying her thoughts only by a shudder that she could not suppress despite her efforts.
- I mean, if you were to become my wife.
- Oh, my beloved!
- Don't you want that?
She threw herself into his arms, fainting, but after a short moment she straightened up.
- Alas," she murmured, "it's impossible.
- Why impossible?
- Don't ask me, don't make me say it.
- On the contrary, I want you to say it.
She turned her head away and, in a voice that was barely perceptible, with a stifled breath:
- My brother...
- It's because of your brother that I want this marriage.
Then, immediately picking himself up:
- Do you think I'm a man to put up with the foolish prejudices of the world?
III
Saniel had not waited for this day to recognise the salutary influence that Philis, by her very presence, exerted on him. However, the idea of taking her as his wife had never occurred to him: he was so little suited, he thought, to marriage; he felt so little like a husband; until recently, he had had so little need of a home!
It was all of a sudden that this idea came to him and struck him strongly, at least as much by the calm he felt inside him as by the charm that emanated from her, the health, the happiness, the cheerfulness and the life.
- Ah, if I still had you!
This word, which had escaped him, characterised the situation -- what he lacked and what he hoped for.
It wasn't just the bodily calm that she gave him by some mysterious affinity that his medicine didn't understand, but which he felt was no less powerful; it was also the moral calm.
He had duties towards her, and terribly heavy ones, towards his mother, towards Florentin.
For this one, he had done what he could, and even more than he could, suddenly becoming a solicitor, besieging people, importuning them, daring anything to soften his fate and prevent his embarkation, which until now he had succeeded in doing, while waiting for something better.
But that was really not all he owed them: Florentin was no less imprisoned with wretched people; Madame Cormier, fallen into dreary despair, grew weaker every day, and Philis, despite her resilience and valour, was crushed under the weight of unjust fate.
How much the situation would change if he married her -- for them, and for him!
What a relief! Hence his cry: "It is for your brother's sake that I want this marriage"; at least he would have done what he could to redeem, within human means, what he had been powerless to prevent.
When Philis had recovered a little from her confusion, she asked him:
- When did he decide to get married?
He didn't want to lie and replied that it was at that very moment that the thought had occurred to him, precise enough and strong enough to give substance to the ideas that had been floating around vaguely for several months.
- Did you at least think it through?" she asked fearfully, "did you not give in to a love drive?
- Was it better to give in to a long-reasoned calculation? I'm marrying you because I love you, and also because I'm certain that I can't be happy without you: frankly, I recognise that I need you, your tenderness, your love, your strength of character, your even temperament, your invincible faith in hope, which for me, as I am organised, are worth the finest dowry.
- It's just that I don't have the slightest dowry to bring you. I could well, when you were desperate and crushed, ask to become the wife of the poor village doctor you were going to be; but today, in your position, especially in the one you will soon occupy, is poor little Philis worthy of you? Today you are giving me the greatest joy I can taste, the one I only dreamt of when I told myself it would be madness to hope for its realisation; but it is precisely this that gives me the strength to ask you to reflect, and to see if you will ever regret this moment of training that makes me so happy.
- I have thought about it, and what you are saying to me right now proves, better than anything, that I was not mistaken; I want a woman who loves me, and you are that woman.
- More than I can say at the moment, dizzy with happiness, but no more than I can prove to you in the continuity of our love.
- Besides, my dear girl, don't delude yourself about the splendours of this position you speak of; it is more than likely that they will never come true, because I am not a man of money and will do nothing to earn any; unless it comes on its own...
- It will come.
- That's not the goal I'm pursuing: I've largely achieved what I wanted; if I were to earn money now and build up a rich clientele, the jealousy of my colleagues would make me miss out or wait too long for what I still want and what my ambition prefers to fortune. For the time being, therefore, my position will be modest: my four thousand franc salary as an agrégé, what I will earn at the central office until I become a hospital doctor, plus five hundred francs a month that my publisher is offering me for work on a bacteriology journal, will give us about a dozen thousand francs, and we will have to make do with that for quite a long time.
- For me, it's a fortune.
- For me too; but I didn't want to warn you any less.
- And when do you want us to get married?
- Immediately, as soon as the time required by law has elapsed, and also as soon as I have moved into a new flat, because you can't go in with my wife in this one, where we have seen you come so often: it would hurt you to pass in front of the concierge and would embarrass me to go in with you. I hope I'll find a place easily, and I think you'll want to be no more demanding than I am.
- Oh dear!
- Besides, this time we won't do the folly of putting ourselves at the discretion of the upholsterers: the first one was expensive enough.
He said these last words with fierce energy, but immediately continued:
- What else do we need? A sitting room for the clients, if any come; a study for me, a room I can use as a laboratory; a bedroom for us, one for your mother...
- You name it...
- But of course! Did you really think I'd ask you to part with her?
She took his hand and kissed it with a passionate impulse:
- Oh, the dearest and most generous of men.
- Let's not talk about that," he said with obvious embarrassment. In your mother's state of moral prostration, it would kill her to leave her alone; the doctor wouldn't allow it: she needs you, the poor woman, and I promise to help you ease her pain. Precisely because she doesn't have your strength, we'll have to take a lot of care of her. We will arrange a home for her where she will not be sad; and, although I am not a very tender person, I will try to replace the one from whom she is separated: she will be happy if she sees you happy.
He spoke at length about what he wanted, feeling a sense of satisfaction in talking about what he would do for Madame Cormier, in whom at the moment he saw much more Florentin's mother than Philis'.
- Do you think we'll make her forget?" he said from time to time.
- Neither she nor I will ever forget, but it is certain that our sorrow will be drowned in our happiness, and we will owe that happiness to you. Oh, how you will be adored, respected and blessed.
Adored, respected! He repeated these words softly to himself. So it was possible to be happy by making people happy. Until now he had had so little opportunity to care for others that this was a kind of revelation of a feeling that surprised him, but which, because it was new, was all the sweeter for him.
He wanted to give himself the satisfaction of tasting all the sweetness.
- Where are you going this morning?
- I'm going back to the boarding school to work on my pupils, who are doing their compositions for the prizes; it's this circumstance that has given me an excuse to sleep there: I need some nice coasters to take home to my parents for the holidays.
- Well, while you're at boarding school this very morning, I'll go and see your mother. The method of proposing marriage that we have just used may be original and in accordance with the laws of nature, -- if nature admits of marriage, which I don't know, but it is certainly not in accordance with the laws of the world, and now I must address this proposal to your mother.
- What joy you will give her!
- I certainly hope so.
- All the same, I'd like to be there to enjoy her happiness. Imagine that Mum has a mania for marriage; she spends all her time marrying people she knows or doesn't know; she only reads novels about the wedding at the end, happy if it takes place, desperate if it doesn't; and she was convinced, poor woman, like me, that I would die in the yellowed skin of an old maid. Finally, this evening she will have the pleasure of telling me about your visit and your request. As for this visit, don't make it until after midday, because by then our cousin will have left.
Saniel spent the morning looking for the flat he wanted and, as he had no requirements other than those of a distribution appropriate to his needs, he found one in a deserted street in the Invalides district, which he stopped at. Perhaps this district was not within easy reach of customers, but would he ever have customers? In any case, if he did, it wouldn't be the Auvergne, and they could come and get him at Les Invalides!
It was around one o'clock that he went up to Les Batignolles, where he found Madame Cormier putting her little flat in order after the cousin had left. As always, when he came in, she gave him a look of anxious curiosity, the meaning of which he knew only too well: what had Florentin got? would he not leave?
- It's not him I have to talk to you about today," he said, without mentioning his name, which was unnecessary.
Madame Cormier's face expressed painful disappointment.
- It's about Mademoiselle Philis...
- Do you think she's ill?" cried Madame Cormier, who could admit nothing but misfortune.
- Not at all; it's from her and me. Don't worry: I hope that what I have to tell you will not cause you any grief.
- You must forgive me if I see cause for fear everywhere; we have been so terribly tested, so unjustly!
He cut her off, for her complaints were not to his liking:
- For a long time," he said briskly, "Mademoiselle Philis has inspired in me a deep feeling of esteem and tenderness: I could not have seen her so brave, so valiant in adversity, so determined in life, so good to you, so charming in everything, without loving her, and I have come to ask you to give her to me as a wife.
At Saniel's first words, Madame Cormier's hands had been shaking with an increasing tremor:
- Is it possible?" she murmured, bursting into tears. Such happiness for my daughter! Such honour for us, for us, for us!
- I love her.
- Forgive me if I am carried away by emotion beyond the bounds of propriety, but I am losing my head. We are so unhappy that our soul is weak against joy. Perhaps I should not speak like this; but, on the other hand, it seems to me that I would be unworthy of the happiness you bring us if I did not answer you frankly. Perhaps I should also conceal my daughter's feelings; but, for the same reason, I cannot fail to tell you that this esteem, this tenderness of which you speak, she shares; I have known it for a long time, although she has never admitted it to me; your request can therefore only be welcomed with happiness by both mother and daughter.
This had been said in broken tones, obviously from an overflowing heart, but suddenly her face saddened:
- I have just spoken to you," she continued, "in the sincerity of my soul; carried away by a surge of joy that I did not believe I could yet experience. But reflection must take us back. You are young, I am no longer young, and my age makes it my duty not to give in to temptation. We are unfortunate people, you know that better than anyone; crushed outcasts. You are a happy man of this world; soon you will be a rich man, a glorious man; is it wise for you to burden your life with a woman who is in my daughter's position?
That was Philis' answer, except for a few words, and he gave the same answer to the mother as he had given to the daughter.
- I'm not speaking for you," continued Madame Cormier, "I wouldn't presume to give you advice; I'm only speaking from my daughter's point of view, from my own, her mother's point of view, who, with the experience of my age, must look after her future. Is it certain that in the struggles of life you will never have to suffer from this marriage, not because my daughter will not make you happy - on that point I am at ease - but because the situation that fate has created for us will weigh you down and hamper you? I know my daughter, her delicacy, her worried susceptibility, - that of the unfortunate, - her pride: that of the blameless; this would be a wound for her that would make unhappiness succeed happiness, because she would not bear contempt.
- If that is human nature, it is not mine; I give you my word on that.
- You can be sure that I only want to believe you; I only said what I did because I had to.
It was true, then, that there were men in this world who were clairvoyant enough to recognise the qualities of a poor girl and to ask only those qualities of her?
He explained how he intended to organise their lives and, when she realised that she had a place between them, she cried out, clasping her hands together:
- Oh God, who took my son from me, how good of you to give me one back!
IV
He wanted nothing better than to be a son to this poor woman; in reality he would be better than this unfortunate boy, soft and incapable. What did this mother-hungry woman need? A son to love. She would find him in her son-in-law. Seeing her daughter happy, how could she not be happy herself?
He could tell himself that no one was less inclined to infatuation than he was; so it was only fair to acknowledge that he was repairing as far as possible the fate of which they had been victims.
Obviously they would be happy, the mother as well as the sister, and whatever Philis thought, still suffering from grief, they would forget. They owed him this consolation. For him, it was something, even a lot.
It had been a long time since he had worked with the serenity that sustained him that day, and when he went to bed in the evening, worried as always about his night, he fell asleep as peacefully as if Philis had leaned her charming head on his shoulder and breathed in her perfume.
Decidedly, making people happy was still the best thing in the world, and when you could give yourself this satisfaction, there was no need to worry about being unhappy yourself: when you create an atmosphere of happiness for others, you benefit from it at the same time as they do.
He waited impatiently for Philis, for she was sure to bring him an echo of her mother's joy, and this was a reward that was owed to her.
No doubt she arrived happy, smiling, full of tenderness; but he watched her too closely not to see that she had some ulterior motive, something that embarrassed her and that she didn't say.
He was not prepared to admit that she could hide from him and not tell him everything.
He immediately asked her:
- What are you hiding from me?
- How can you think I'd hide anything from you?
- What is it? You understand, don't you, that nothing can happen inside you that I can't read in your eyes? Well, your eyes speak when your lips are silent.
- It's because I have a request to make of you, a prayer.
- Why don't you say it?
- Because I don't dare.
- But it seems to me that I'm not so inclined as to make you think I'm refusing you anything.
- That's precisely where my embarrassment and reserve come from: I'm afraid of upsetting you at a time when I want to show you all the gratitude and love in my heart.
- If you must upset me, the best thing is not to keep me waiting.
She hesitated; then, faced with an impatient gesture, she made up her mind.
- I wanted to ask you how you intend our marriage to take place?
He looked at her surprised.
- But like all weddings!
- All marriages?
- Are there any that are different from the others?
- Yes, they do.
- You know that I don't understand this way of asking questions in riddles; if you want to allude to a social custom that I don't know, say it frankly: it's not to hurt my feelings, since I'm the first to admit that I don't know any. What is it you want?
She could feel her irritation growing, and yet she couldn't make up her mind.
- I should have told you first of all that you will always find in me a woman who respects your ideas and your beliefs, who will never allow herself to judge them, let alone try to combat or modify them.
- Concluded," he said impatiently.
- So I think," she said with embarrassed and fearful hesitation, "that you will not admit that I am disrespecting your ideas by asking you to marry in church.
- But that was my intention.
- Oh dear, and I was so afraid of hurting your feelings!
- Why do you want to hurt my feelings?
- Do you agree to go to confession?
Instantly the smile that had been in his eyes and on his lips was replaced by a flash of fury.
- And why shouldn't I go to confession?
- he cried.
- You think I'd be afraid to go to confession! Why do you suppose that? Say why.
He looked at her with eyes that pierced her to the core, as if they wanted to search inside her.
Stunned by this outburst of fury, which had come out of nowhere, since he had just smiled in response to her request for a religious marriage, which she had thought so dangerous, she could think of nothing to say, not understanding how the simple word "confession" could have infuriated him so. And yet she could make no mistake, it was this one and not another who had put her in this state.
He continued to examine her, so she tried to explain:
- I only assumed," she said, "that I could hurt you by asking you to do something that contradicted your beliefs.
The mad anger that had so clumsily carried him away was beginning to lose its initial violence: a word added to what had escaped him would be a confession. Would he never be able to rid himself, even when his mind was in the best of conditions, of the fixed idea that obsessed him? A man like him might be reluctant to confess, but he could not accept the idea that it was supposed that he was afraid of this confession: why afraid?
- Let's not talk about it any more," he said; "above all, let's not think about it any more.
- Allow me just one word," she replied. I would have been in the same situation as everyone else, and I wouldn't have asked you anything; any ideas I might have in my heart would have bowed to yours, I love you enough for that; but for your own sake, for your future, for your honour, you mustn't appear to be marrying an outcast in secret, in shame.
- Don't worry; I feel, as you do, more than you do, that we need consecrated ceremonies.
She soon realised that he was going much further down this road than she was.
So as not to be left with the unpleasant impression of the unfortunate word that had caused the explosion, he offered to show her the flat he had chosen the day before, and they immediately went to the Rue d'Estrée.
For the first time, they walked side by side, head held high, through the streets of Paris, without fear of meeting anyone: what a source of pride for her! Her husband! It was on his arm that she leaned! When they crossed the Tuileries, she was almost surprised that no one turned round to see them go by; she would gladly have shouted to those indifferent, ignorant people: "It's him! Mothers who gaze so tenderly at your children, it is he who will heal them; children who embrace their mothers, it is he who will keep them in your affection for a long time.
In the mood she was in, she couldn't help but find his choice of location admirable: the street, the house and the flat.
As it comprised three bedrooms opening onto a terrace where he would house the animals destined for his experiments, Saniel wanted her to decide which of these bedrooms she would choose; as she was to share it with him, she wanted to take the most beautiful, but he did not accept this arrangement.
- I was asking you to choose between the two small ones," he said. "The large and beautiful one should be reserved for your mother, who, not being able to go out, needs space, air and light more than we do.
How could she not have been overwhelmed with gratitude when she found him so perfectly kind, thoughtful, delicate and generous in all things, small and great alike? She would never have loved him enough to rise to him.
By a stroke of luck, the main rooms, the salon and the study, were more or less the same size as those in the rue Louis-le-Grand, so there would be little or nothing to change in the furnishings. As for the other rooms, it didn't matter; they'd make do with what they had, supplementing it with the furniture from the rue des Moines: it wasn't the present they had to worry about, it was the future; later, we'd see.
This feminine chatter, interspersed with effusions and passionate outbursts, charmed Saniel, who had forgotten the incident of the confession, his anger as well as his obsession, thinking only of Philis, seeing only her, delighted by her gaiety, her vivacity, stirred to the core of his being by the tender caresses of her beautiful dark eyes.
How could he not be happy with this delightful woman, who had taken such control over him, and who loved him so ardently? An unconscious inspiration would not have led him to marriage, but reason and calculation should have. For him, there was only one danger from now on -- solitude -- she would protect him from it; with her zest, her good humour, her courage, her love, she would not let him go back to his thoughts; work would do the rest.
After the question of furnishings, they settled that of the wedding itself, that is to say the ceremony; and it was then that she was astonished to see in him ideas and demands that she had not suspected, and which were even the negation of what she had believed until that day.
The dress had been decided, a dress as simple as possible, which she would make herself like all her other dresses, and they had arrived at the witnesses.
- We no longer have any relations," said Philis.
- You used to have them; your father had friends, comrades.
- I'm no longer my father's daughter, I'm my brother's sister; I wouldn't dare ask them to witness my wedding.
- It's precisely because you're your brother's sister that they can't refuse you: that would be cruelty coupled with rudeness! Cruelty is fine, but rudeness! Who was your father's best friend among talented people?
- Cintrat.
- Isn't he a bohemian, a drunkard?
- My father considered him to be the greatest painter of our time, the most original...
- It's not a question of talent, but of name; I'm sure he's not just decorated. Your father had many other friends, more unquestionably arrived, more bourgeois, if you like?
- Glorious.
- The member of the Institute, perfect?
- Casparis, the statuary.
- An Academician too. That's what we need, and both highly decorated. There's no need to look any further; you just go and invite them, tell them who I am: associate professor at the School of Medicine, hospital doctor; I promise you they'll accept. As far as I'm concerned, I'll take my old master, Carbonneau, currently President of the Academy of Medicine, and Claudet, the former minister, who, as a member of parliament for my department, won't be able to shirk any more than the others; and that will give us some decorative witnesses who will look good in the papers.
It wasn't just in the newspapers that they did well, it was also in the church of Sainte-Marie des Batignolles when they were seen at the head of the procession on the carpet which, in the slightly dark nave, led up from the street to the altar.
- Glorient! Casparis! Carbonneau! Claudet! The arts, science and politics. Unless you had diplomats, you couldn't have hoped for more flowery boutonnieres.
It took the beauty and charm of the bride not to be overshadowed by these glorious witnesses; but when she was seen to pass on the arm of Glorient, so free in her modesty, so radiant with grace, exclamations of admiration and sympathy accompanied her to the sanctuary.
While the priest was celebrating mass at the altar, outside, in front of the gate, a man dressed in a brown velvet suit and wearing a battered felt hat, was strolling along smoking a bouffarde: it was the Count de Brigard, whose principles forbade him to enter churches for weddings as well as funerals, and who was strolling along the pavement with his disciples, waiting for the bridegroom to leave, to congratulate him. When the wedding took place, he cut the procession short and took Saniel's hand, shaking it warmly as he separated from his wife:
- It's good, it's noble," he said; "it's the situation that has made this marriage useless without her. I understand; for that I forgive her; I do more than that, I applaud her. My dear, you are a man.
And as it was a Wednesday evening, during a chat at Crozat's, he publicly revisited this approval which, under the conditions in which it had been given, was not sufficient for his conscience.
- Gentlemen, today we have witnessed a great act of reparation, the marriage of our friend Saniel to the sister of this poor boy, the victim of an injustice that cries out for vengeance. One evening, in this very room, I spoke lightly of Saniel, some of you may remember, despite the time that has passed; I would like to make amends to him publicly, now that he has asserted himself as a man of duty and conscience, bravely putting himself above social weaknesses.
- Isn't it a social weakness," says Glady, "to have chosen as witnesses to this act of reparation people who seem to have been chosen only for the decorative aspect of their official positions?
- Profound irony, on the contrary!" said Brigard, securing his felt hat, "a powerful and fruitful lesson, that which makes the very people who are its professional defenders work together to demolish prejudice! Saniel is a man.
V
On the Sunday after her wedding, Philis was surprised by something she thought about for a long time, without finding a satisfactory explanation.
As she was getting dressed, Saniel came into her room:
- What are you going to do today?
- What I do every day.
- Aren't you going to Mass?
She looked at him astonished, not being in control of her first reaction, and, as always when she seemed to want to read his mind, he became ill-tempered.
- Why is my question so extraordinary?
- Mass isn't exactly the usual subject of your preoccupations, it seems to me.
- It can become so exceptionally when I think of others, and that's the case: didn't you go to Mass sometimes?
- When I could.
- Well, you can today if you like; that's what I had to tell you: and I thought it should be said. I haven't forgotten the promise you made to respect my ideas and beliefs: I want to return the favour, that's very simple.
- Everything that is good and generous seems simple to you.
- So, what do you say?
- I'll go straight away.
- What do you mean, straight away? It's not eight o'clock. You'd better go to High Mass, it's more appropriate.
Proper! What a strange word from him! It wasn't out of respect for propriety that she sometimes went to mass, and more often these days than in the past, but because she had some vague religious and pious feelings that Florentin's misfortunes had intensified.
- I'll go to High Mass," she said, without revealing anything that this word had suggested to her, and continuing to dress.
- Is that the dress you're going to wear?" he asked, pointing to the one lying on a chair.
- Yes, unless you don't like it.
- I think it's a bit plain.
In fact, it was extremely simple, made from a cheap fabric that was only worth the originality Philis had given it by cutting it herself.
- Don't forget," he continued, "that Saint-François-Xavier isn't a church for drudgery; when you're as charming as you are, you get noticed everywhere: people will want to know who you are.
- You're right; I'll take my prize-giving dress.
- That's it, and your closed hat, isn't it? rather than a round hat; the first impression you make should be the right one.
Wasn't this mixture of religious and worldly preoccupation quite surprising in him? She hadn't known much about him until now, had she? After all, perhaps it was only an exception: at the beginning, he had wanted to give her advice that he considered wise.
But these demands on her grooming were repeated.
Although before the wedding she had only passed through Saniel's life, she knew her well enough to know that she was rigorously devoted to work, giving nothing of her time to distractions or even simply to worldly relations; and she had believed that things would continue like that; married, he would work as before he was married. She had been right about work, wrong about distractions, or rather relationships. Shortly after their marriage, one of their witnesses, the former minister Claudet, had caught up with a good portfolio and, Saniel having cured him of a facial neuralgia just in time for him to do the shopping and conduct the negotiations that had led to his appointment, he had taken a great liking to this young doctor to whom he owed his ministry: he was a good man to have on hand, the one who worked miracles and allowed you to go or not to go to the House according to circumstances; not to mention that he took away from you a pain that only those who have experienced it can talk about. Given Saniel's character and his habits, it seemed that this friendship should have had little influence on him: he was a doctor, not a courtier; but it turned out that the doctor and the courtier had become one and the same person, and Saniel had become the commensal of the ministry; there were no meetings, no parties without his invitation, and he accepted them all, for himself as well as for his wife.
What astonishment when she saw him leave everything to sit at the minister's table or appear in his salons, and also when the observations about the dress for mass had been repeated for those for dinners and parties!
First of all, the wedding dress had been adapted to these requirements by skilful decolletage; but it couldn't always fit: it had to be embellished, modified, made into three or four dresses, which wasn't easy; no matter how ingenious she was at these arrangements, a few metres of tulle and gauze didn't provide her with indefinite combinations.
Moreover, they were not enough for him; he found them too simple and wanted lace, jet, flowers, shine, glitter, all the things he saw in other women.
How could she satisfy him with the meagre resources at her disposal? She had brought a miser's thrift into her household; Joseph, who had been dismissed, had been replaced by a maid who did everything, the flat, the cooking and even a bit of laundry; this cooking was of the simplicity of poor people; but these small savings, earned on the one hand, quickly melted away on the other, in the toilets, in the cars that had to be taken, willingly, unwillingly, too often.
So she wanted to get back to work, not on lessons, which was no longer possible, but on menus, which would give her a hundred francs a month quite easily. He didn't agree and, as she gently insisted, he got angry:
- That wouldn't be worthy of you; I don't want it said that my wife does these jobs.
He had only allowed her to paint; since she had painted in her father's studio for fun in the past, and had only given up painting when she had to earn a living because she didn't have enough time to work honestly ; She could return to it now that she was no longer driven by the daily grind; if the profession was shameful, art could be honourable; if she had talent, it would be happy, even glorious; if she sold her paintings, it would be an originality that would make her known in the world. 
Part of the salon had been transformed into a studio and she had tried her hand at a few small paintings which, although they had no pretensions to great art, were nevertheless pleasant, easy, and done with a brilliant chic that appealed. Glorient, to whom she had shown them, had found them "as nice as anything", and he had had two of them bought by his dealer, who had ordered others, at a low price, it is true, very low even, but in the end, for her, much higher than she had expected.
With the courage and constancy that women bring to what pleases them, she would gladly have worked from morning to night; but the relations that Saniel had created for himself did not allow her the freedom to do so. By the very fact that he was a regular at Claudet's, he had been invited elsewhere, and since instead of shunning these invitations he had sought them out, the result had been worldly obligations which devoured her time. Every day she had one or more visits to make: she had to go to funerals, weddings, show up at charity sales; she herself had her day, and for three hours she had to listen to feminine chatter of no interest to her.
And what pleasure could he take in putting on a suit when he was tired after a day well spent, to go to a salon, he son of a peasant, who remained a peasant in so many ways, he who once understood nothing of worldly life and had nothing but contempt for it, finding it as boring as it was ridiculous.
She had tried to guess the cause of this change, and when she had deftly, lightly and in a roundabout way got him to explain himself, she had only come up with one answer, which for her was no answer at all:
- You have to be part of the world.
Was it for her sake, because she was the sister of a convict, that he wanted to impose himself everywhere and have her admitted with her head held high? She would have understood this to a certain extent, even though the role he was making her play was the cruellest one she could have been given, and precisely the opposite of the one she would have taken if she had been free.
But there was more to her need to be part of the world than that. He, for having married her, was not the brother of a convict, and yet, observing him closely, one could believe that what he asked of these relations and of the people in high positions that he sought was a share in their importance, their consideration, their honour, as if he wanted to cover himself with it. But he didn't need that importance, consideration or honour, and he had nothing to take from them by rubbing shoulders with them. He was someone in his own right. The place he had made for himself was worthy of his merit. His name was honoured. His future was envied.
And yet, as if he didn't feel this, he sought small satisfactions unworthy of a serious ambition and an undisputed worth; hadn't she been surprised, one evening when they were walking home, to hear that he had just been offered the decoration of a Spanish republic. Although she had learned to watch her words, an exclamation escaped her:
- What would you do with that?
- I couldn't refuse it.
Not only had he not refused that one, but he had also accepted others: blue, green, yellow and tricoloured ones too; he had worn them in his lapel, around his neck and on his suit. What good could these decorations, which diminished him, do him? And how could a man of his merit be in such a hurry to obtain the Legion of Honour before it fell naturally to him when it was ripe for him?
There were astonishments, obscurities and nonsense that kept her mind busy when she was sitting alone at her easel, painting, while next to her, in his laboratory, he was carrying out his experiments or writing an article for his Revue.
But it was not without resistance that she allowed herself to judge him in this way: we don't judge those we love, and she loved him. Wasn't it disrespectful of her love not to admire him in everything? When these ideas tormented her, she left her easel and, getting up, went to find him where he was: close to him, they dissipated. The first few times, so as not to disturb him, she tiptoed in, walking with muffled steps, and leaned over his shoulder, kissing him before he had seen or heard her; but then he betrayed such fright, such fear, that she gave up this way of approaching him.
- Why are you coming at me like that? What are you after? What do you want?
Instead of surprising him, she announced her arrival, slamming the bolt on the door and dragging her feet; and instead of greeting him with concern, he received her with open joy.
- You're not working any more?
- I've come to see you for a bit.
- Well, stay here, don't go back straight away; I'm never so happy, I never work so well as when I have you near me.
It was true, she could see and feel it; by the very fact that she was near him, whether she spoke or not, he was happy just by her presence.
But it was important that she didn't seem to be looking at him too attentively, with the obvious intention of observing him, because when this had happened in the early days of their marriage, he had become angry and upset, as when she had had the clumsiness to fall on his back unexpectedly:
- Why are you examining me like this? What are you looking for in me?
She had taken it for granted and, when she stayed close to him, she observed herself to keep a discreet attitude that wouldn't upset him: no curious looks, no questions, he was happy. However, as this attitude was not always convenient, she would ask him to help her, and after him she would go over the proofs in seconds, or she would clean up the rather crude drawings that he had made himself for his microscopic research. If he had wanted to stay like this and, in this sweet intimacy, let the evening pass by without mentioning going out, how happy she would have been! But he never forgot the time:
- Come on," he would say, interrupting himself, "it's time to go out.
She had never dared to ask the real reason for this "we must".
VI
If she didn't dare ask him frankly, "Why do you have to go out?" no more so than the others: "Why is it appropriate for me to be seen at mass? -- Why do I have to wear clothes that ruin us? -- Why do you accept decorations that are of no value to you? -- Why do you seek the company of people who have no merit other than that which they derive from their official position or their fortune? -- Why do we impose on ourselves worldly duties that bore us as much as each other, instead of remaining face to face in a tender and intelligent intimacy that is as sweet to us as to each other?
Had they all belonged to this order of ideas, she would undoubtedly have found an explanation for them: a disposition of character; the demands of an ambition in a hurry to fulfil its desires; susceptibility or shady pride; but there were others that were based on observations or memories that had nothing to do with these, or so it seemed to her.
Had she begun to know her husband the day after her marriage, she might have believed that he had always been as he revealed himself to her; but that was not her case, and the man she had loved resembled so little the man whose wife she had become, that one might have thought they were two.
In truth, it was not marriage that had brought about the changes in her mood that struck her, but they were no less characteristic in that they dated back to a time before her marriage.
How they had begun, she recalled with a clarity that left no room for doubt or hesitation: it was at the moment when the proceedings of his creditors had brought him into contact with Caffié. For the first time, he, always so firm that she believed him to be above weakness, had had a moment's despondency when he announced that he might be obliged to leave Paris; but this despondency had none of the anger or faint-heartedness that she had found in him later: it was the just sorrow of a man who sees his future shattered, nothing more. The only surprise she had felt at the time had been caused by the idea of strangling Caffié and taking from his till the money he needed to get out of trouble, and also because he had told her -- as a consequence of this act -- of the remorse of the intelligent man, who never has to bear the reproaches of his conscience, since for him conscience does not exist. But this was obviously a mere philosophical theory, not a character trait, a word of jest or an argument for discussion.
Rid of his creditors with the money he had won in Monaco, he had regained his composure, working harder than ever, passing his competitions, and, when he was in the best conditions to show himself nervous, violent, unjust, brutal, remaining, on the contrary, the man he had always been since she had known him. Then, all of a sudden, shortly before Florentin's trial, these strange moods, these angers, these worries, inexplicable to her, had erupted at precisely the moment when, thanks to Madame Dammauville's intervention, there was hope that Florentin would be saved. She had not forgotten the furious anger with which he had rejected her request to see Madame Dammauville, without anything to explain or justify this outburst: He had chased her off harshly, he wanted to break off the engagement, and until she had witnessed it she could not imagine that such violence could be put into exasperation; This scene had been followed by another, quite the opposite, which had struck her no less, when, at their dinner by the fire, he had shown such deep desolation by advising her to keep the memory of that evening for the day when she wanted to judge him, and by announcing to her in a sort of prophetic way that an hour would come when she would want to know the man she loved. 
And now that hour, the thought of which she had dismissed long ago, had come; now she was trying to put together the elements of this judgment which, at the time, seemed criminal to her, and now imposed itself on her preoccupations no matter what she did to put it off.
How many times had this memory come back to her, to the point where it could be said that it had never left her, sweet and painful at the same time, and less sweet and more painful as new subjects of concern were added one after the other, emphasising the mysterious and troubling impression it had left on her!
Judging him! Why did he want her to judge him? And on what grounds?
And yet, for him, these were not insignificant words, but the observation of a particular state of his consciousness, which had been confirmed several times since. Indeed, was it not to this order of ideas that belonged the cry that had escaped him in the night when, waking up suddenly, he had asked with emotion, with fear: "What did I say? And to the same man belonged the anger that had overtaken him when, talking about their religious wedding, she had mentioned confession: "Why do you admit that I might be afraid to go to confession?
How could he imagine that she could admit to him the idea of this fear? It had never occurred to him until that moment, and if now the memory of his astonishment came back to him, it was because other little facts, adding to each other with the passage of time, evoked it.
How numerous and significant these facts were: his constant concern to see himself observed by her; his irritation when he could suppose that she was thinking of questioning him; his fits of anger when, through inadvertence or clumsiness, through forgetfulness, or simply by chance, she asked him a question on certain subjects, and immediately the returns of tenderness that followed, so sudden that they seemed rather intended for a specific purpose than natural and spontaneous.
For a long time she had been willing to admit that the sweet words that made her so happy were calculated; but in the end she had to open her eyes to the evidence and see that they were the consequence of the same constant preoccupation -- that of not giving herself away.
It was only a short step from wondering what he didn't want to give up.
However short it was, she had long resisted the curiosity that drove her: it was her duty as a loving and devoted woman not to look beyond what was shown to her, and this duty was in perfect accord with the dispositions of her love; but the very force of the things seen had prevailed over will and reason: she could not apply her mind to looking for what distressed her, she could not close her eyes and ears to what struck them.
And what struck them were the same observations, always turning in the same circle, applying to the same subjects and the same people:
The name Caffié irritated him;
Madame Dammauville's name angered or disturbed him;
Florentin's name made him positively miserable.
As for Caffié's and Madame Dammauville's, she had been able to prevent them from being uttered, when she had seen the effect they infallibly produced.
How could she have told her mother never to pronounce the name of the man who constantly occupied their thoughts; how could she herself have stopped it from her lips?
Despite Saniel's representations and solicitations, backed up by those of Nougarède, Florentin had been shipped off to New Caledonia, from where he wrote as often as he could: His letters had recounted his tortures in the penal colony where he had been imprisoned during his crossing, and since then they had been one long complaint which continued from one to the next like an endless tale, always on the same subject: his material sufferings, his humiliation, his disgust among the wretched people with whom he was a companion, his despondency. 
When these letters arrived, it was a desolation for the mother and sister that filled the house with tears for several days; and then he would get angry at this pain that neither of them could conceal.
- What would you do if he were dead?" he would say to Philis.
- Wouldn't he be less to be pitied?
- He'll be back at last!
- But in what condition?
- Are we masters of fate?
- We weep; we don't complain.
But he complained about the weeping faces around him, the tears that were hidden from him, the sighs that were stifled. Usually, he was gentle and affectionate with his mother-in-law, with a thoughtfulness and deference that, in some ways, even had something affected about it, as if it were by will rather than by natural feeling that he was like that; but then he forgot this gentleness and treated her harshly, so unfairly that more than once Madame Cormier could not help complaining to her daughter:
- How can your husband, who is so good to me, be so ruthless when it comes to Florentin? Our grief seems to have the same effect on him as a reproach.
One day, when things had gone further than usual, she had the courage to explain herself to him.
- Forgive us for imposing on you the tedium of our grief," she said to him: "when I complain about everything, men and things, you must think that you are excepted, you who have done everything to save him.
But these few words, which she thought would calm her son-in-law's irritation, had, on the contrary, exasperated him, and he left furious.
- I don't understand anything about your husband," she told her daughter. Won't you explain to me what's wrong with him?
How could she have given her mother an explanation she couldn't give herself? Faced with an unfathomable abyss, she didn't even dare lean over it to look into the depths, and instead of going forward along the path she had unwillingly embarked upon, she made an effort to turn back, or at least to stop.
That was the way it was. Well, there was nothing she could do about it. What was the point of finding out why he was like that, and what was underneath what he was so careful to hide? It could only be a guilty curiosity for which she would one day be punished.
By continually turning over and over these thoughts, she had lost her zest, her strength to resist the blows of fate, as well as the annoyances of life, which had once made her so valiant; the spring so vigorous in her had sagged under the too heavy weight that loaded it, and her smiling eyes now more often expressed anxiety than happiness and confidence.
No matter how carefully she observed herself, she had not been able to hide these changes from Saniel, for they were evident in everything: in her formerly open face, which now bore the imprint of locked-in pain, in her concentrated attitude, in her silences and distractions.
What was wrong with her? He had questioned her: she had answered nothing that would have been enlightening for him, other than the very caution she put into her answers. He had examined her as a doctor, and had found nothing to indicate a state of illness, and therefore nothing to justify her changes.
If she didn't want to answer his questions - and he had proof that she didn't; if, on the other hand, she wasn't ill, and he was convinced that she wasn't - something serious must have happened to her, for the woman in whom he used to read so easily had become the troubling enigma that worried him.
And what was it, if not the one whose crushing weight he himself bore on his sagging shoulders? She had guessed; she had understood, if not everything, at least part of the truth!
What an extraordinary situation he was in, and one that was perfectly suited to baffle his reason.
Nothing to fear from others, everything from himself: justice, the law, the world, on all sides he was left alone; nothing was asked of him: what was owed had been paid; but he, by some sick aberration, was going to wake the dead who were sleeping in their graves from which no one thought of pulling them, and turn them into spectres that only he could see, only he could hear.
And he thought he was strong. What a fool he was, and even more ignorant, to have taken on such a burden when, by exercising his will, he had not put himself in a position to carry it! To want! But he had not learned to want, nor to use the brake that the brain puts on, so that he was like the lower animals whose reflex movements are accentuated by the removal of the brain.
VII
The relative calm that Saniel had experienced since his marriage was due to Philis, to the strength, confidence and peace that he drew from her. Philis without strength, without confidence, without inner peace, as he saw her now, could not give him what she no longer had, and he returned to the troubled times that had preceded his marriage, with the same disordered and sterile agitation, the same anguish, the same panic. Good relations, worldly esteem, success, decorations and honours were good for others; but for his own rest, he needed his wife's tranquillity and serenity, her good moral health which passed through him when she slept on his shoulder; then, no sudden awakenings, no insomnia: at the sound of her gentle breathing, he was reassured and the ghosts remained in their graves.
But when that breathing became agitated, when he could no longer feel that tranquillity and serenity in her, when he saw her weak and worried, it was no longer like that: it was his fever that she was giving him, not his sleep.
- Aren't you asleep? Why aren't you asleep?
- Why aren't you?
He had to know.
He asked her more questions, but she always defended herself, or rather evaded him, without him being able to get anything out of her, stopped as he was by the fear of giving herself away, which seemed easy at the point where one would think she had arrived; a clumsy word, too much insistence would make her light up.
So he pretended to speak only as a doctor when he questioned her, and to seek in her only medical explanations for her condition: If you don't sleep, it's because you're suffering; what is this suffering? Where does it come from?
Having no reason to justify it, since she didn't even dare talk about her brother, she stubbornly denied it.
- But I've got nothing," she repeated; "I assure you I've got nothing. What do you want me to have?
- That's what I'm asking you.
- So I'm asking you: "What do you want me to hide from you?
He couldn't admit that he suspected she was trying to hide something from him.
- You're looking at yourself wrong.
- There's nothing I can do about that.
- I'll make you observe yourself better and talk.
- How will you do that?
- By putting you to sleep.
The threat was so terrible that it threw her off her feet.
- Don't do that!" she cried.
- Why shouldn't I?
They stared at each other in silence for a few moments, both equally appalled: she at the threat, he at the confession he had just extracted; but to show this apprehension was, for her part, to drop another even more serious one.
- Why shouldn't I try, by every means possible, to discover in you the causes of these illnesses that elude my scrutiny as well as yours; for this, induced somnambulism offers us an excellent method.
- But since I'm not ill," she tried, "what can I tell you that's more sleepy than what I tell you that's awake?
- We shall see.
- It's an experiment I'm asking you not to try: would you try a poison on me?
- Sleepwalking is not a poison.
- Who knows?
- Those who have used it.
- You are not one of them.
- I still know enough so that you are in no danger from me.
She thought he was opening a door for her to escape.
- If you ever want me to talk in a state of induced somnambulism, ask one of your colleagues whom you trust to put me to sleep.
In front of a colleague, she was sure he wouldn't ask her any dangerous questions.
He understood that she was still trying to evade him.
- Afraid of what? Afraid that I'll ask you about the past, about what your life was like before we met, and ask you for a confession that would be a wound to my love.
- Oh, Victor," she cried distraught, "what more cruel wound could you have inflicted on me than that of these words: my confession! But it consists of two words: I love you, I have only ever loved you, I will only ever love you; I have no past: my life began with my love.
He could not press her any further without showing the importance he attached to this interrogation:
- I won't insist," he said; "it was a way like any other, better than any other; you don't want it, let's say no more about it.
But he had given in too quickly for her to expect him to give up his plan, and she was left with a stupefying fright. What would she say if he made her talk? Wasn't everything possible, when she didn't even know what thoughts were lurking in the back of her mind and she didn't even know what the induced sleepwalking she was threatened with was.
At that time, the work of the Nancy School on sleep, hypnotism and suggestion had not yet been published, or at least the book that served as its starting point was not known, and she knew nothing of the procedures that can be used to induce hypnotic sleep, having been left with what she had read, without paying much attention, about Cagliostro. As soon as her husband had left, she searched the library for books that might enlighten her; but the dictionary she found only provided her curiosity with obscure or confused information, in the midst of which she drowned; the only precise point that struck her was the formula to be used to induce sleep; make the subject you want to put to sleep look at a shiny object placed 15 or 20 centimetres above his eyes; if this were true, she need have no fear of ever being put to sleep.
However, she did not allow herself to be reassured, and when a few days later she found herself at a dinner party next to one of her husband's colleagues, who, she knew, was interested in sleepwalking, she had the courage to overcome her usual shyness about anything to do with medicine and ask him:
- Is it only people who are ill with certain diseases who can sleepwalk?
- In the past, the public and many doctors believed that somnambulism could only be induced in people suffering from hysteria or nervosism, but this was a mistake: artificial somnambulism can be obtained in a large number of perfectly healthy subjects.
- Does one retain one's will during sleep?
- The subject retains only as much spontaneity and willpower as his hypnotist wants to leave him, who can make him sad, happy, angry, tender and play his soul like an instrument.
- But it's appalling.
- Curious at least; it is certain that there is a local paralysis of this or that cell, the study of which will become the starting point for interesting discoveries.
- Once awake, does the subject remember what he said during his sleep?
- There is some disagreement on this: some say yes, others say no. As for me, I believe that memory depends to a large extent on the degree of sleep of the subject: in light sleep, there is memory; in deep sleep, the subject remembers neither what he said, nor what he heard, nor what he did.
She would have liked to continue, and her interlocutor, happy to talk about what was occupying him, would have gladly followed her, but she saw her husband standing at the other end of the table looking at them several times, and lest he should guess the subject of their conversation, she left it at that.
But as long as she did not allow herself to be hypnotised, she had nothing to fear; and sticking to what she had read, she promised herself never to allow him to place her in conditions where he could put her to sleep: it was during sleep that the hypnotist's will took the place of the subject's, not during wakefulness.
Relying on this belief and also on the fact that he had never spoken to her again about putting her to sleep, she reassured herself: wasn't this a sign that he accepted the resistance she had put up to him and gave up his idea of induced somnambulism?
But she was wrong.
One night when she had gone to bed at her usual time, while he was still working, she woke up suddenly to see him standing beside her, staring at her with eyes that frightened her.
- What is it?" she asked, "what do you want?
- Nothing, I don't want anything; I'm going to bed.
Despite the strangeness of the look that had struck her, she didn't insist: questions wouldn't have taught her anything; and besides, now that he wasn't going to bed at the same time as her, there was nothing extraordinary about his attitude.
But a few days later she woke up again in the middle of the night with a feeling of embarrassment, and she saw him leaning over her, as if he wanted to wrap his arms around her.
This time, however frightened she was, she had the strength not to say anything, but her anguish was all the more intense: was he trying to hypnotise her while she slept? Was that possible? So the dictionary had fooled her?
The dictionary had been accurate at the time of publication, but it was no longer accurate in terms of the procedures to be used to induce sleep; it was, in fact, while she was asleep that Saniel was trying to transform her natural sleep into an artificial one by means of passes. Would he succeed? He didn't know, since the experiment was new; but he risked it.
The first time, instead of putting her into a state of somnambulism, he had woken her up; the second time, he had no better success; the third time, when he saw that after a while she did not open her eyes, he assumed that she was asleep. To be sure, he raised one of her arms, which remained in the air until he lowered it onto the bed. Then, taking both her hands, he turned them round, and withdrawing his own, the impulse he had given her continued until he stopped her: her face had an expression of calm and tranquillity that had not been seen in her for a long time: she was the pretty Philis of yesteryear, with a cheerful face.
- Tomorrow I'll put you to sleep at the same time," he said, "and you can talk.
The next day, in fact, he put her to sleep, and even more easily; but when he questioned her, she resisted.
- No," she said, "I won't talk, it's horrible, I don't want to, I can't!
He insisted, she defended herself.
- Well, so be it," he said, "not today, tomorrow, but tomorrow I want you to speak and not resist me; I want to!
If he hadn't insisted, it was not only because he knew that it would take a certain amount of habituation to make her submit to his will without her being able to defend herself, but also because he didn't know whether or not she would keep the memory of what had happened in her sleep when she was awake - which was a crucial point.
The next day she was as she had been the day before, and there was no indication that she was aware of her induced sleep, or of what she had said in that sleep.
This time she fell asleep even more quickly and easily, and her face once again took on the expression of relaxed tranquillity he had seen the day before. Would she answer? And, if she did, would she speak sincerely, without trying to soften or distort the truth? Emotion made his voice tremble when he asked her his first question; it was her life, her rest, their happiness that was being decided.
- Where are you suffering?
- I'm not in pain.
- But you're restless, sometimes gloomy or worried; you don't sleep well. Who's tormenting you?
- I'm afraid.
- Afraid of what? Of whom?
- Of you!
He shivered.
- Scared of me! Do you think I could hurt you?
- No, I couldn't!
His tightly wound heart relaxed:
- Then why are you afraid?
- Because there are things going on inside you that frighten me.
- What things? We need to be more specific.
- The changes in your mood, your character, your habits.
- Why should these changes worry you?
- Because they indicate a serious situation.
- What situation?
- I don't know; I've never said.
- Why didn't you say?
- Because I was afraid, so I closed my eyes to avoid seeing.
- See what?
- The explanation for all the mystery in your life.
- When did you notice any mystery in my life?
- At the time of Caffié's death; and before that, when you told me you'd kill him without any remorse.
- Do you know who killed Caffié?
- No, I don't know.
He was so relieved that, for a few moments, he forgot to continue his questioning; then he resumed:
- And then?
- A little before Madame Dammauville's death, when you became irritable and furious about nothing; when you chased me away because you didn't want to see Madame Dammauville; when, on the evening before her death, you were so tender and asked me not to judge you without remembering that hour.
- But you judged me.
- I never did. When worry drove me, my love stopped me.
- Who was causing this anxiety apart from these facts?
- The way you've been since we got married: your fits of anger and tenderness, your fear of being watched, your restlessness at night, your complaints...
- Have I spoken?" he cried.
- Never clearly, but you often moan, you complain, you say words that are interrupted and unintelligible...
The anguish had been violent; when he had recovered, he continued:
- What is it about this way of being that still worries you?
- Your constant concern not to give yourself away...
- Give what away?
- I don't know what.
- What else?
- The anger you feel, or the embarrassment, when people mention the name Caffié, Madame Dammauville, Florentin...
- And you conclude from my anger at hearing these three names?
- Nothing... I'm afraid!...
VIII
This confession shocked him, for although it did not go beyond what he had feared, it nevertheless revealed a terrible situation.
If she didn't know everything, she had only one more step to take to arrive at the truth, and if she didn't take it, it was because her love had held her back: if this love had been less solid, less great, she would certainly not have resisted the evidence that was pressing on her from all sides.
But the fact that this resistance had been maintained to this day did not mean that the struggle would continue and that a more violent blow, a stronger proof than the others, would not open her eyes in spite of herself.
All it would take was one careless, clumsy move on her part, and, unfortunately, he had run out of them.
Instructed by what he had just learned, it was easy for him, it is true, by observing himself strictly, to avoid dangerous subjects, those she had just pointed out to him; but if during the day he could watch her words and her looks, say nothing or let nothing appear that was an accusation, not confirm the suspicions against which she was struggling, he could do nothing at night.
He had not spoken, and it was a terribly heavy weight that she had lifted from his heart by answering his question in the negative, but he had moaned, he had complained, he had uttered words that were interspersed, uninterrupted, unintelligible, and there lay the danger.
What did it take for these sighs and groans, these interspersed, unintelligible words to become distinct and take on meaning? Nothing, by chance, since his current cerebral disposition put him in a state of somnambulism to a certain extent. Were these abilities congenital or acquired? He didn't know. And before the restless nights that had followed the death of Madame Dammauville and the conviction of Florentin, he had never had the idea that he could speak in his sleep; but now he had proof that the vague fears that tormented him on this subject were only too well founded: he spoke, and if the words that escaped him were not at the moment comprehensible, they might become so.
Without having made any particular study of sleep, whether spontaneous or induced, he knew that in natural somnambulists hypnotic sleep is easy to produce, and that by talking to a subject who talks in his sleep, it is easy to hypnotise him. No doubt he did not have that to fear from Philis; but what was possible was that one night when he let slip some incoherent words, she would not be able to resist the temptation to engage him in conversation and get him to confess what she wanted to know, what the love she felt for her brother made her want to learn. If this happened, which would win out, love for her brother or love for her husband? If she questioned him, what would he not say?
For the first time he asked himself if he had been right to marry, and if, on the contrary, he had not been foolish to introduce a woman into a life as tormented as his own. He had asked this woman for calm, and now she was bringing him terror.
To tell the truth, she was only dangerous at night, and if he could find a way of sleeping in separate rooms, he would have nothing to fear from her during the day, provided he remained rigorously defensive. Loving her as she loved him, she would resist the curiosity that was driving him.Little by little, this anxiety and curiosity, no longer overexcited, would subside, and they would be able to revisit the sweet days that had followed their marriage.
But in the present circumstances it was difficult to find such a way, for to suggest to Philis that they make two rooms was to admit that he was afraid of her, and consequently to give her a new mystery to study. He searched, and starting from the idea that the proposal for the two rooms had to come from Philis herself, he arrived at a combination which, it seemed, could achieve what he wanted.
Unaware that she had been hypnotised and not remembering that she had spoken, Philis was no doubt still afraid of being put to sleep; if he threatened her again, she would certainly try to defend herself by escaping from him.
This is what happened: when, the very next day, he told her that he definitely wanted to put her to sleep to find out what was going on inside her, she showed the same fear as the first time.
- Everything you've asked of me, everything you've wanted," she said, trying to contain herself, "I've wanted it like you and with you, but I'll never accept that.
- As your resistance is crazy, I won't stop there.
- You won't put me to sleep against my will.
- I won't.
- It's not possible.
Without answering, he went and got a book from his bookshelf and, leafing through it, read:
"Is it possible to change a sleeping person from natural sleep to hypnotic sleep without waking them up? It is possible, at least for certain subjects.
Then he handed him the book:
- You see, all I have to do to put you to sleep artificially is to take advantage of the moment when you are sleeping naturally; it's very simple.
- That would be odious.
- Words.
He had thrown her into a fright that kept her awake all night, feverish, and as he himself did not sleep for fear of speaking, he felt that she would do anything not to be asleep. But hadn't he gone too far, and by this threat wasn't he going to push her into some desperate act: if she ran away, if she abandoned him? What would become of him without her? Wasn't she his whole life? But he reassured himself that she loved him too much for a separation to ever be possible. After searching, she would undoubtedly come to the idea that he wanted her to have.
Indeed, when he came home in the evening, she told him that her mother was not in good health and asked him to examine her. The result of the examination was that Mrs Cormier was in her usual state; however, she complained of choking; during the day she had feared syncope.
- If you wanted," she said, "I'd sleep next to my mother; I'm afraid I won't be able to hear her tonight if she's unwell.
At first he refused, but then he agreed to this arrangement and, to thank him, she stayed with him in his study, affectionate, full of tenderness and caresses, until the moment he went to his room.
He was therefore free to sleep or not to sleep; whether he moaned or spoke, she would not hear him, since there was no communication door between his room and that of his mother-in-law; his voice, for sure, would not pass through the partition.
Who could have told him, the night he had decided to marry, that he would end up like this: afraid, hiding from the woman who had given him back the peace of sleep; and all through his own fault, through a chain of imprudence and blunders, as if it were written that his suffering would be his alone, and that if he ever succumbed to the whirlwind that was dragging him down, it would be his own doing, his own hand. In the meantime, he had ensured the tranquillity of his nights, and as a further precaution, although he had no reason to fear that Philis would enter his room while he was asleep to surprise him, she who did not dare look in the face what suspicion showed her, he locked his door. No doubt Philis wouldn't always be able to sleep next to his mother, but in the meantime he would look for a way of frankly sleeping apart, and he was sure to find one in the arsenal of medicine.
As the night was hot, he thought a bit of fresh air would calm him down and he opened his window; if the fresh air didn't calm him down, at least it put him to sleep.
Forced to improvise a bed in her mother's room, Philis had placed it against the partition separating her from her husband, without any preconceived intention, simply by chance, because it was the only place where she could put it. In the middle of the night an unusual noise woke her up: she sat up to listen and recognise herself; it seemed to be coming from her husband's room; worried, she put her ear to the partition; she had not been mistaken, they were muffled moans, complaints repeated at fairly short intervals.
Cautiously, but nevertheless briskly, she got out of bed, and as the dawn had already whitened the windows, she was able to leave deftly and quietly. When she reached the door of her husband's room, she listened; she had not been mistaken: they were indeed complaints, but louder and more painful than those she had heard so often during the night. She tried to enter, but the door resisted, obviously locked from the inside by the bolt or the latch. A vague fear froze her. What had happened? She had to find out, run to him, help him. She thought of knocking, of shaking the door, but since he hadn't answered when she tried to open it, it must be that he didn't hear or didn't want to hear. So she had the idea of going out onto the terrace, where she could see what was going on and, if necessary, break a pane to get in.
She found the window open and saw him on the bed, his head turned towards her, asleep; she stopped, wondering if she should cross the threshold and wake him.
At that moment he uttered, with closed lips, a few words more distinct than those that had escaped him so many times:
- Philis... forgive.
He was dreaming of her; poor friend, what did he want her to forgive him for? for threatening to put her to sleep, no doubt.
In the crack of the window, she moved her head forward without entering the room, so touched by this sign of love, to give him a look before going back to her mother; but when she saw his face, which the white light of the morning was striking, she was frightened: it expressed the most violent pain, that face with its convulsed features, anguish as well as horror. He was certainly ill. She had to wake him up. As she took a step towards him, he began to speak again:
- Your brother... or me.
She stopped dead in her tracks, then instinctively stepped back and clung to the hall window so as not to fall, repeating to herself the two words she had just heard, not understanding, not wanting to understand.
Instead of returning to her mother's side, she staggered into the living room, holding on to the wall, and fell into an armchair, crushed.
- Your brother or me!
It was the truth, the terrible truth, that she had never wanted to see.
She stayed there until the noise of the morning warned her that she was about to be surprised, then she returned to her mother, who woke up.
- I'm going out," she said, "I'll be back at half past eight or nine.
- But your husband won't see you until he leaves for the hospital.
- Tell him I've gone out.
She returned at half past nine. Mrs Cormier had finished dressing.
- There you are at last," she said.
But she could see from her daughter's face that something threatening was going on:
- What's the matter?" she asked, trembling.
- Something serious, very serious, but irreparable by misfortune: we're going to leave here and never come back.
- Your husband...
- You must never speak to me about him; that's my prayer to you.
- Alas, I understand. What I had foreseen, what I had told him, is coming true: you cannot bear the contempt he is bringing down on us because of your brother.
- We have to be strangers to each other from now on, and that's why we're leaving this house.
- My God, at my age, dragging my bones...
- I've rented a flat at Les Ternes; a removal van is coming to take the furniture that belongs to us, just the ones we brought here. As far as the concierge is concerned, we're going to the country. As for Joséphine, you need have no fear of indiscreet questions, I've just given her the day off.
- But what about money?
- I still have two hundred francs from the sale of my last painting, that's enough for now; before they're used up, I'll have done and sold another; don't worry, we won't be short of anything.
All this was said in a jerky but resolute tone.
They were interrupted by a ringing bell. It was the removal men.
- Make sure they only take what belongs to us," said Philis; "while they're loading their car, I'll write in the living room.
After an hour, the carriage was loaded. Madame Cormier went into the living room to tell her daughter.
- I've finished," said Philis.
Having enclosed her letter in an envelope, she placed it in full view on Saniel's desk.
- Let's go now," she said.
And as her mother sighed, walking with difficulty:
- Lean on me, poor Mum, you know I'm strong.
IX
Saniel was not due back until fairly late in the afternoon. When he came in, opening the door with his key as usual, he was surprised not to see his wife running up to kiss him.
- She's working," he said to himself, "she didn't hear me.
He went into the living room, convinced that he would find her in front of her easel: but he didn't see her, and the easel itself was no longer in its usual place, either there or anywhere else.
He knocked on the door of Madame Cormier's room, but there was no answer; he knocked harder and waited a moment before going in; the room was empty: no bed, no furniture, no-one.
He looked round in astonishment, then, hurrying back into the hall, called out:
- Philis! Philis!
There was no answer: he ran to the kitchen, there was no-one there; he went to his study, there was no-one there either, but as he looked around, Philis's letter on his desk jumped out at him:
"I have left never to return. My despair and my disgust with life are such that if it hadn't been for my mother and that poor creature over there, I would have killed myself; but despite the horror of my situation, I had to think it over, and I didn't want to add to the harm that has been done around me by a weakness. My mother is no longer young, she is ill and has suffered cruelly; not only do I owe it to her to ease her old age by my presence, by the material and moral support I can give her, but she must have the confidence that I am there to replace her and open my arms to her son, to my brother. It's the least I can do for them to wait courageously; and however heavy, terrible and appalling my life may be from now on, I'll bear it so that the unfortunate outcast that implacable fate has struck down will find a home, a house, a friend when he returns. This will be my sole aim, my raison d'être, and in order to save myself from cowardice and weariness, my thoughts will always be focused on the hour when the one I want to make my child, and whom my love must save and heal, will be returned to me. I know that long years separate me from that day, and that my broken heart will never have a moment's rest before it rises ; But I will use that time to work for him, for the brother, for the child, for the loved one who will come to me old and in despair, and I want him to still believe in something good, not to imagine that everything is unjust and vile in this world, because he will come back to me weighed down by twenty years of shame, degrading and undeserved shame. How will he have endured these twenty years? What efforts will I have to make to prove to him that he must not give in to despair, and that life sometimes offers a remedy, compassion for the deepest, most unjust human suffering! How can we make him believe that? How do you get his poor closed heart to trust, to open up, to weep, which is the only thing that can relieve him? Finally, God, who has tested me so much, will no doubt come to my aid and inspire me with consoling words, show me the path to follow and give me the strength to persevere; don't I already have to bless Him for being alone in the world apart from my mother and my brother, those who will not betray me? I have no children of my own, and I am saved from the terror of seeing a soul grow up for evil, an intelligence escape me and go towards infamy or dishonour. So I am leaving as I came: poor girl I was, poor woman I am leaving. I have taken back the clothes and personal belongings I brought into the common dwelling, none of those acquired with the common money, and I forbid you to change anything about my will in this material matter, any more than about my resolution to flee from you. Nothing can ever bring us together again; nothing will, no consideration, no necessity. I reject the past, this guilty past whose responsibility weighs so heavily on my conscience, and I would like to lose the memory of a hated time. It would be impossible for me to accept the struggle, nor the pleas if it were convenient for you to make them. I have severed our ties, and from now on we will be as far apart as if one of us had died, farther still. So don't have any qualms about leaving me alone to face a new life, a new beginning that may seem difficult and painful to anyone who is not in my shoes. The hardships of the past will have been good for me, because they have hardened me to the difficulties of work; the desolation of today will sustain me, in the sense that, having suffered all that can be suffered, I no longer have to fear some discouraging catastrophe that would stop me in my tracks. In order not to compromise you and to become myself again, I will take back my family name, a dishonoured name, but one that I will bear without shame. I will live in obscurity, absorbed in my work and endeavouring to forget even your existence: do the same. You may find me harsh, if you think of the past; however, this departure is not a selfish desertion; I am no longer good for you, and the rest you need would henceforth flee from you near me. On the contrary, seek oblivion as I will seek it myself. If you can erase from your life the time I spent there, you may be able to put the rest of it behind you and regain a little of the calm you once had. I can no longer remember that I loved you, because my situation is so peculiar that I do not even keep the refuge of memory; at my age, I have to remain without a past as well as a future; I lack everything that makes up the consolation of the unhappy. I can't get out of my despondency to try to find an hour when life has been kind to me; on the contrary, those hours make me shudder and I reproach them to myself as if they were a crime. So, wherever I turn, all I find is pain and poignant regret; everything is withered and dishonoured for me.
He had read this letter written in one go, in one go, standing in the middle of his study; when he reached the end, he looked around vaguely; his armchair was slightly away from his desk: he dropped into it and stood there, devastated, holding the letter in his clenched hand:
- Alone!
It was a dark and muddy October afternoon; in the rue des Saints-Pères, along the houses that hide the Hôpital de la Charité, coupés were lined up, waiting, and their line extended as far as the boulevard Saint-Germain, where the coachmen, having got out of their seats, were chatting like people who are used to meeting each other. From the porch with its pretentious, heavy columns, which forms the corner of the street and the boulevard, at about half-past four, in the darkness that was beginning to fall, we saw a number of serious-looking men in dark clothes emerge -- the members of the Academy of Medicine -- who, the Tuesday session having ended, were returning to their carriages: Some of them were alone, hurrying off at full speed; others were accompanied, taking their time, stopping to speak kindly to a journalist and recommending the day's paper, or continuing with a fellow non-academician the discussion begun in the Salle des pas-perdus; it was the end of the Bourse aux consultations, the most amusing feature of this place for those who know how to watch or are aware of the little electoral intrigues that are played out there. Not all the members of the Academy have a long list of patients to visit; but they all have a voice to give, and it is these that the candidates surround themselves with, trying to win them over... You already have a rich clientele, but you're not yet a member of the Academy; so you manoeuvre to get there: with the surgeon, you arrange, at the expense of clients who have faith, a consultation to see a superficial panic attack; with the doctor, you arrange one to visit a migraine sufferer. One hopes that, when the day comes to vote, the academician will not refuse his vote to a colleague who, through consultations of this importance, earns you a thousand or fifteen hundred francs a year, sends you game from his hunt, his box at the Opéra, his coupon from the French; and that, gallant man that he is, he will have the gratitude of his stomach or his purse.
One of the academicians, who appeared last at the top of the steps, was a tall man, but stooped, with a hollow, pallid face, illuminated by two pale blue eyes with a strange expression, hard and desolate at the same time; he advanced alone, and at his heavy gait, at his shuffling step, one could wonder if he was sixty years old, while in other respects he still retained a certain youthfulness, -- Saniel, aged twenty years.
Without anyone exchanging a nod or a handshake with him, he went down to the pavement, and, going up it, he came as far as the boulevard, where he opened the door of a coupé whose interior showed the complete installation of a travelling library: writing table, with paper, inkstand and lamp, pockets, bellows all full of books and pamphlets.
Just as he was about to get in, a voice stopped him:
- Dear master!
He turned round; it was one of his former interns, a doctor who had recently moved to the suburbs near Gentilly, who had come running.
- What is it?" asked Saniel.
- I'd like to ask you to come and help me with a very curious case of eclampsia, where your intervention could be decisive.
- And where might that be?
- At the White House, a poor woman... What day can you give me?
- Is it urgent?
- Yes, it is.
- Immediately then; come upstairs with me, after explaining to my coachman.
But just then, a white-haired man, dressed in brown velvet, wearing a battered felt hat and clogs, came towards them accompanied by two young men with whom he was talking loudly and gesticulating: as they passed, people turned to look at them, so original was the outfit of old Brigard, who had remained from head to foot the man of yesteryear.
He came to Saniel with both hands outstretched, and Saniel, hat in hand, greeted him with every mark of respect.
- I'm delighted to meet you," said Brigard, "because yesterday I went to your consultation without seeing you.
- Why didn't you let me know? If you need me, I'm all yours.
- Thank you, fortunately I don't need your advice, either for myself, as you can see, or for my family; I just wanted to see you. I arrived at your house before the hour, waited in your living room, and then several people came in behind me: a young woman who seemed to be in great pain, an old woman who gave every sign of anxiety, and a man who was agitated by disorderly movements and couldn't stay in place. And as I looked at them, I said to myself that, since I only had a friendly visit to make to you, I was going to prolong the wait of these unfortunate people who were counting the minutes; so I left.
- May I ask why I was honoured with this visit?
The two young men accompanying Brigard and Saniel's former intern had discreetly taken a few steps away.
- I wanted to offer you my congratulations. When I learned of your candidacy for the Académie de Médecine, I said to myself: "Here's someone who doesn't stand a chance; he's original, our friend Saniel, he's strong, he's succeeded brilliantly, and these qualities are not exactly academic". I was wrong: you broke down the doors, which is the only way to get into these places that I understand; that's why I congratulate you. Besides, I was wrong to you once...
- Wrongs, you?
- I accused you of thinking you were stronger than life: you were indeed stronger than life; my compliments! It's a comforting sight for me to follow you.
After shaking Saniel's hands warmly, he walked away, accompanied by his two disciples, preaching.
The young doctor approached Saniel:
- Here's an original," he said.
- A happy man!
END
