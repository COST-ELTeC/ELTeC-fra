I
THE DAIMIO OF KAMA-KOURA
- If my friends in Tokio saw me like this, with my nose to the ground, crouching very humbly before the daimio and his noble wife, they would find me very unmodern, not at all 'on the train', as they say in Paris, so it seems, and they would laugh at me. I look like a feudal samurai, prostrate before his lord... It's true that our feudal system still reigned only twenty-five years ago and that, morally, I'm still a vassal of my prince in this very backward court. Kama-Koura is not Tokio, alas!
It was through the cheerful mind of the young student Yamato that these reflections passed, as he crouched, hands on thighs, head bent over his chest, listening with a profoundly respectful air to the communication made to him, in a slow and solemn voice, by the old daïmio of Kama-Koura.
The prince was sitting on the floor, on a white mat, in front of a beautiful screen with a gold background and peony blossom, and beside him, standing, the princess, his wife, was fanning herself restlessly.
- This very morning," said the daïmio, "my son's mother came up to me and said something like this: 'My Lord, have you noticed how pale our dear San-Daï is, how deep his eyes are, how wearily he shuffles as he walks, and what too serious a crease is tightening his pretty mouth, made for laughter?
So I replied, "Yes, Princess, I noticed all that a long time ago, and I thought that our only child was devoting himself too exclusively to study, that the time had come for him to be a little crazy and dissipated, as young men of his age are. I made him understand this several times, allowing him to amuse himself as he pleased; but he replied, "Life is short, science infinite; why waste such a short time on frivolous pleasures? I insisted, as far as was possible without compromising my paternal dignity; San-Daï did not want to understand, and now more than ever he is hard at work. So my noble wife and I thought that you, his fellow student, you who are as cheerful as he is serious and who sometimes manage to make him laugh, you might find a way of pulling him out of this state, which the doctor says is dangerous, and entertaining him, almost in spite of himself. Let's see, what will you think of to force my son to enjoy himself?
- My lord," said Yamato, raising his brow, "if Your Highness allows me, I will take Prince San-Dai to Tokio and take him to the Yosi-Wara.
On hearing this, the princess raised her pale, proud head, fanning herself even faster, but the old lord smiled and blinked with a fine air.
- The Field of Reeds!" he said, "I went there in my youth: it was a place as delightful as it was magnificent.
And placing his golden pipette on the armrest, the prince tugged the brush of hair on his chin between his fingers, smacking his lips several times.
Yamato recognised that his lord was about to honour them with a speech, and in order to listen to him with all due respect, he sat back on his heels and made himself as comfortable as he could.
The princess closed her fan and opened her mouth to say something, but the daimio held up his finger to curb this revolt against etiquette. The wife bit her lips and did not speak.
- It was the will of a great statesman," he began, "a reformer, too daring in my opinion, who, with a political aim, created from scratch, two hundred years ago, these princesses of love, who populate the Yosi-Wara. Flowers of luxury, charm and beauty, which are still cultivated today, and which will soon be the only remnants of the splendid Japan of yesteryear.
They too will disappear, like everything else, alas!
Yamato was about to get up, thinking that was all, as the daimio paused to breathe out a few sighs. But he continued:
- This is the famous usurper Tokougava Hieyas, of the Minamoto, as you may have guessed; he is the one whose dynasty gave shoguns to the empire until the recent revolution. You know how hard Hieyas tried to reduce the power of us sovereign princes in favour of his own power. He was only too successful, and the revolution, after two hundred years, is the ripe fruit of what he sowed. At the time of his accession, he demanded that the princes come and stay at Yédo, the new capital, for several months of the year, with their wives, whose luxury was supposed to add lustre to the court, and whose precious persons could be held hostage if any misunderstanding arose. But the proud princesses remained in their castles; and, if they could not evade the order, the daïmios were present only in fact, in the capital, their hearts and minds elsewhere, shortening their stay.
It was definitely taking a long time. Yamato sat down on the floor, while the princess reopened her fan and raised it to her mouth to yawn.
- What a perfidious and ingenious invention!" exclaimed the old lord, with a broad gesture, who unfurled the brocade embellished with gold wheels, its large sleeves in the old fashion, artificial princesses, chosen from among the rarest beauties, brought up in all the refinements of aristocratic taste; instructed in rites and etiquette, learned, virtuosos in all the arts! All young, passionate, dangerous, intoxicating and... accessible! Did the princes see the trap? In any case, they fell for it and fell into the silk nets. There was no longer any question of drudgery; their stay in the capital became particularly pleasant; they even lingered there beyond the prescribed time. In their faraway castles, the real princesses did not immediately understand the danger. In the past, it is true, the courtesan had been a chosen one, a fearsome rival sung by poets; but that was a long way off, and haughty wives had nothing but disdain for these merchants of smiles, likely to distract their lord for a moment. Those who saw the danger ran to defend their property. For many of the others, the disaster of happiness and fortune opened their eyes too late. The proverb "the courtesan is the destroyer of the castle" probably dates from that time.
- So," said the princess, lifting her lip with an air of disgust, "we continue to bring up, with as much and even more care than our children, daughters of nothing, to whom we pay honours, as to women of the highest rank, which, in my opinion, does little honour to men.
- My dear, nothing distinguishes these people from real princesses, except that they are more beautiful," said the daïmio mischievously. Ah, what conversations we have with them, in the flowery language of the Yngui years, when the mikado Atsou Kimi [1] reigned! The glorious past comes back to life with them, and you are filled with wonder!
The princess made great efforts to conceal her anger, while Yamato glanced down at her and held back a smile.
- You said it yourself, my lord", she said, "the courtesan is the devastator of the castle", "don't throw your son prey to this voracious beast.
- My son has too much spirit to let himself be devoured," said the prince; "what worries me rather is the idea that he will not agree to follow Yamato to the city of love. How will you persuade him to allow himself to be led?
- My lord," said Yamato, "our dear prince has hardly left Kama-Koura. Apart from his books and his castle, he knows nothing; it will be easy for me to make him believe whatever I want.
- What will you make him believe?
- For example, that a very learned prince has discovered an unpublished manuscript by some great Chinese philosopher, and that we are going to ask him to send us this precious document?
- Ah! ah! a Chinese philosopher!" exclaimed the daïmio, with a burst of laughter; "it is certain that, following this philosopher, you would make him go to the end of the world, while he would not turn his nose to see the most beautiful of living flowers.
- And what will you do if he turns his back on the very learned prince, turned into a courtesan?
- Once I'm there, I'll entrust myself to the god of love, Your Highness," said Yamato. This science is worth any other.
- Come on, go and see my intendant," said the daïmio, "he will give you a large sum of money so that you can carry out this lovely adventure.
II
MODERN TOKIO
The result of this secret conference was that the young prince San-Daï and his mischievous friend arrived in Tokio that very evening at Simbassi station.
San-Daï stood at the edge of the pavement, staring blankly at the street lined with lampposts and telegraph poles, while his companion gave orders to the servants who had come with them to carry their luggage.
- Do you really think the Prince will agree to let me see this precious fragment?" asked San-Daï, when Yamato had joined him. "If I don't get this reward, I'll regret having undertaken this tiring journey.
- You're tired!" exclaimed Yamato; we've hardly been on the road three hours and it seems to me that you've taken great pleasure in looking at the flowery countryside, listening to my chatter.
- I suppose I did! When left unattended, the mind is too easily distracted... But remember that, in order to keep up with you, I interrupted some reading I was doing.
- Alas, the sixty-volume work of a commentator on the See Chou!
- I had only read three chapters.
- Patience, the book I want you to read is far more interesting than this one.
- I believe it's an unpublished fragment by Meng-Tze! But why are you laughing when you say that?
- I'm not laughing, I'm motioning to a horseman to approach his vehicle.
- Aren't we going to the hotel for a change of costume?
- We're fine like this," says Yamato, "where we're going, we like to keep things simple.
Arriving from the provinces, the two young men were dressed in Japanese style, which is still not too ridiculous, even in Tokio.
Several djinrichichas had lined up along the pavement.
Yamato got the prince into one of them and into another, after saying a word in a low voice to the riders, who set off at full speed.
They rode tumultuously through the city, through the crowded streets; then, in the quieter districts, they rode abreast, almost silently, exchanging a few words aloud.
- How far!" said the prince.
- We're halfway there," replied Yamato.
It was getting lonelier and more uninhabited. They came to the rice fields, which went on and on.
- Crua! crua!" cried Yamato, "can't you hear what the frogs are saying? Go on! go on! and they all turn their big green heads towards the Yosi-Wara.
Then he recited a popular outa:
"When the frogs themselves advise me, how could I not go to the Yosi-Wara?"
The riders laughed and the prince could not hear.
We reached the end of Mumamitci Avenue, which bends at a sharp angle and, at Yamato's sign, the men stopped in front of a small temple.
It is preceded by a torié, a red-lacquered wooden portico, and once you have passed through it, you can see two stone foxes sitting on narrow pedestals, their tails tucked up, faithful guardians of Inari, the god of love.
- You don't pass through here without saying a prayer," cried Yamato, jumping out of the djinrichicha.
But the prince didn't get out.
- We have nothing to ask of that god," he said.
The Sintoist temple of Inari is a wooden aedicula, open on one side, with a niche at the back in which strands of golden paper hang.
Yamato was already near the carved lapis lazuli basin next to the threshold; he was purifying his teeth with salt and, taking the small long-handled wooden goblet, he moistened his lips and fingers, then threw a silver coin into the basin, which joined others protected from thieves only by the sacred water.
The penko, a Chinese perfume, was burning, filling the chapel with blue smoke. The young man knelt outside on the steps, clapped his hands together and said aloud:
- Inari! Inari! give us beauty, so that we can please and be loved!
- What do we need to be beautiful to please a learned old prince?" asked San-Daï, leaning over the edge of the carriage.
- Couldn't there also be exquisite princesses and countless maids of honour in his castle?
- You're still the same madman.
They set off again.
Already, at the end of the avenue, against a backdrop of golden powder, the bars and branches of the great gate of the Yosi-Wara stood out in black.
A prodigious hubbub was going on all around; the djinrichichas were arriving impetuously, amid the shouts of the runners; a noisy and joyful crowd was besieging the gate, or pushing to see beyond the gates, while police men, dressed in black with a white character on their backs, a cloth tied round their heads, were waving bells at the end of iron canes, following a funny and pretty rhythm.
- What's all this noise and all these people? Can it be suitable for the meditation of a thinker?
To keep from laughing, Yamato bit the inside of his cheek.
- Man, absorbed in his thoughts and his work," he said, "sees nothing and hears nothing. This is indeed a very special castle, not at all reminiscent of the austere lordship of Kama-
Koura. But for minds like ours, reflection can explain everything. Perhaps the wise man is surrounded by fools; too busy with abstract problems and lofty philosophical questions, he is not at all concerned with ordinary life and lets his family and vassals run the ceremonial of the palace. From all appearances, they must be in a joyful mood.
The young man spoke volubly and made many gestures to daze his companion and prevent him from seeing the gigantic lanterns, somewhat lost in the dust raised by so many footsteps, on which were written in Chinese characters: "Yosi-Wara Daï-Mïozin".
They thus passed through the great gate called Omon and entered the City of Love.
III
THE CITY OF LOVE
A strange palace indeed!
Once through the gate, instead of the shady, peaceful avenue, guarded by a few old servants with serious, respectful faces, there was a wide, straight street, full of crowds and noise, lined with tea houses, pavoisées and illuminated, with, in the folds of the banners, the title of the establishment "À la Pluie de Printemps", "Au Bois de Cerisiers", "Au Saule Vert".
- You've certainly made a mistake," said the prince with a touch of impatience; "there are too many lunatics surrounding this wise man, and I warn you that I'm getting tired of all this noise and hullabaloo.
- You forget that today is the Doll Festival!
cried Yamato: no doubt the maids of honour have let in all these people on this occasion; but come this way, dear lord, we'll rest in a quiet place, while we go and announce ourselves to the daimio, and ask for an audience with him.
And, breaking through the crowd, he quickly dragged her away, to prevent her from seeing the pamphlets containing portraits and praises of the courtesans, dancers and jesters of the Yosi-Wara, which a travelling salesman was handing them.
An elegant woman, who must have been beautiful, greeted them at the threshold of the teahouse. Yamato, whom she seemed to know, had time to make a sign to her, warning her to be on her guard, that there was a mystery, while the prince, quite surprised, examined, near the entrance, an altar on which offerings were laid out: rice, cakes, flowers, and whose symbols, fortunately, were hidden by a veil of gold brocade.
Graceful girls dressed in pale silks hurried over, took off their shoes and, walking on fine white mats, they entered a small room where there was no one.
On the floor were a few beautiful embroidered cushions, a gold lacquer smoking box and a tray laden with cups and flasks; on the partitions, made of rare wood, were kakemonos signed by well-known names and, on the shelves, albums and books.
To Yamato's horror, the prince went straight to the books with the naive greed of a student.
- We're lost this time," murmured the student; "the less than respectable subjects of these joyful volumes will unmask our deception all too soon.
However, as he caught sight of the title of an album, which he immediately thrust into San-Daï's hands with a mischievous grin, he said to himself:
- Saved!
He then had plenty of time to take the mistress of the house aside and explain the plot to her, because the prince, sitting next to a lantern veiled in white silk, looked very interested as he looked at the album and read the legends.
He saw Sakia-Mouni, still in his teens, leaving his castle at Kavira-Vasta to seek out the true moral doctrine and to try to discover the meaning and mystery of human life. He arrived in a large city and asked about a philosopher he wished to interview. Some young fools pointed him to a garden in full bloom, whose inhabitants could give him some information. There he found delightful women who surrounded him, cuddled him, offered him cakes and fruit and, to all his questions about the philosopher, answered with nothing but caresses and laughter. The book implied that the Buddha was in no way angry and was even very pleased with his mistake; but San-Daï didn't believe this, shaking his head and telling himself that the end of the story must be wrong.
Yamato came closer and sat down beside the prince, while the elegant woman bowed.
- This kind person," he said, "is called Mai-Dzourou, the Dancing Stork; she was the nursemaid of the princess, the beloved daughter of the daimio you wish to see, and she will give us all the information she can about him and his castle.
San-Daï bowed his head; the Dancing Stork got up, sat down opposite him and offered him a small lit golden pipe, which he accepted.
- The prince, our master," she said, "is a great scholar, always absorbed in reading books and barely taking the time to eat. He takes care of nothing in his domain, and his vassals take advantage of this to amuse themselves day and night: - Life is short, you have to grab pleasure by the sleeve!
The lord, deep in his flat, in a pavilion set in the middle of deserted gardens, hears nothing and sees nothing.
Apart from a few privileged servants, no one is allowed near him, except his daughter Princess Hana-Dori, so aptly named
"Flower Bird".
- Ah! tell us about Princess Hana-Dori," exclaimed Yamato.
- She's the wonder of Japan," said the Stork.
Dancer with an ecstatic expression. It's not because I brought her up and love her like my own child that I'm talking like this; I'm a connoisseur of beauty, and I've seen some incomparable princesses. But this one is a goddess, perfection itself, a miracle! Without mentioning her singing, her dancing, her accomplished knowledge of all the arts, which would already put her in the first rank of women, even if she were deprived of other charms, I'll just describe her person to you. The oval of her face is pure and elongated, quite similar in shape to half a watermelon; her hair, black as Kioto lacquer, forms on her forehead, half-hiding it, the snowy peak of Fousi-Yama; but the snow would look dirty next to her complexion; her eyes are fresh and shining like the Morning Beauties wet from the rain; her nose is straight and noble; her mouth, eager, red like the Botan flower; her teeth look like jade pearls; her eyebrows have the shape of the new crescent; her loins are supple like willow wood; her fingers fine like the little fish called siraho: her arms are as white as the pulp of turnips. Finally, her whole person is a disgrace to the moon; standing, she is like a kaido plum tree; sitting, like a clump of peonies.
The Dancing Stork, a little out of breath, took a deep breath.
- What a beautiful description!" exclaimed Yamato. I'd give a finger of my left hand to see the original of this magnificent portrait!
- The beauty of Princess Hana-Dori is not what should interest us here," said the prince, more interested than he wanted to let on.
- If I speak to you in this way about the Flower Bird," continued the false nurse, "it is because she alone can obtain from her father what you desire. She knows all his work, sometimes helps him with his research, because she is a leader in literature, poetry and even philosophy. The priests from the great temples of the capital often come to talk to her and are amazed by the seriousness of her mind. So, first of all, you have to please the princess and gain her trust if you want the precious document in our master's possession to be communicated to you.
- It will soon be too late for you to be admitted to the princess.
The Dancing Stork nudged Yamato to point out the prince's impatience.
- I have already sent some servants to Hana-Dori," she said; "they will inform her that a young prince has travelled from Kama-Koura to Tokio, all the way from Kama-Koura.
Koura to Tokio, expressly to see the learned daimio, his father, whom we never see. She will certainly take pity on you and grant you audience so that she can convey your request to the prince.
- This really is a very unkempt outfit," said San-Daï, anxiously adjusting the folds of his dark grey crepe dress.
- Don't worry about that. Flower Bird judges men's hearts and minds, and doesn't worry about their dress.
The pretty girls poked their heads through the gaps in the partitions; they waved their fingertips at the young men's shoes, inviting them to come and put them back on; the servants had returned, bringing the good news that Princess Hana-Dori had agreed to receive the son of the daimio of Kama-Koura, and was waiting for him at this very moment.
- Let's be worthy of this favour by not wasting a minute.
The Dancing Stork lit a red lantern with a coat of arms painted on it.
- I'll be your guide," she said.
She beckoned three of the girls to follow them, went ahead carrying the lantern on a bamboo stick, and they left the teahouse.
Outside, the crowd had thinned a little. Those who had come just to spend a moment, as curious onlookers, without spending any money, had already retired; the others were organising parties, hiring jesters and dancers. In the tea houses, the sounds of music and singing could be heard, mingled with laughter, the clinking of bottles and even the popping of champagne corks.
Groups, similar to the one formed by Prince San-Daï and his companions, each preceded by a lantern-bearer, entered or left the Green Houses, inhabited by courtesans of the first and second rank.
The Dancing Stork soon turned into Kiomati Avenue, where many people were still crowding round, and parked in front of the latticed façades, behind which the second-rate courtesans were on display in superb gowns under the light of lanterns and gas.
Like idols, seemingly unaware of all the glances directed at them, amidst the flowers and gold of their dresses, arranged in graceful folds, they sat on carpets, leaning against embroidered cushions, busy reading, smoking, writing, or appearing to dream. Occasionally, a servant would say a word quietly to one of them, who would then stand up and nonchalantly leave.
Yamato would feign indignation.
- Really," he said, "these European and American customs are invading us a little too much! It's scandalous! Would anyone ever have believed that the princesses' maids of honour would show themselves so shamelessly to the crowd? The bamboo blinds were always down in front of their houses, and the samurai themselves only saw them as mysterious shadows, like beautiful fish gliding, with flashes of mother-of-pearl and gold, under the thickness of the green water.
It's true," he added apologetically, "that it's a warm evening and it's the Doll Festival.
Fragments of song flew by, terribly modern too:
"... In the old days, it was a long way to get to Yosi-Wara; the norimonos, carried by men, dragged along very slowly. Even the fastest horse would keep coming.
"Long live the railways, which bring us to this palace of joy from every corner of the empire in just a few hours today!
Or again:
"I implore you, delicious young lady, let me put a telephone between your bed and mine!
Clumsy, ungainly civil servants and students, dressed as Europeans, passed by with an air of importance, sucking the golden apple of their cane and mixing French and English words into their conversation. The prince found them very ridiculous and could hardly contain himself from laughing as he watched them.
But we had just entered another, more peaceful street.
The Dancing Stork stopped in front of an elegant house, carefully enclosed and dimly lit from the outside.
We entered the vestibule, between two rows of servants, prostrate as the prince passed. Behind him, Yamato threw them some money.
- We will leave you here, dear lord," he said. It seems that the Flower Bird only wants to receive you.
The Dancing Stork lifted an embroidered satin door and, with Yamato and the servants, entered a room on the ground floor.
The Dancing Stork lifted an embroidered satin door and, with Yamato and the maids, entered a room on the ground floor, while other young girls, extremely pretty and dressed like beautiful butterflies, led the prince towards the staircase and again took off his shoes.
To replace them, they brought the sandals known as fucouzori, which are so difficult to wear for those who are not used to them, because they are held on the feet only by a cord looped over the toe.
The staircase, made of charming wood carefully polished with wax, was difficult to climb, and the prince stumbled with his shoes on, so the young girls, with great grace and reserve, supported him to the landing.
He was ushered into the VIP lounge. There he found everything he had come to expect from a stately palace: the partitions decorated with delicate paintings, the white mats, the blue goat's hair carpets, the embroidered cushions, the sumptuous screens, the shelves loaded with exquisite objects, the bronze vases bursting with cleverly combined bouquets; everything down to the subtle, warm perfume wafting through the air.
A maid of honour, of perfect distinction, received him at the entrance, seated him and left to inform her mistress.
IV
THE PRESENTATION
The young Prince San-Daï struggled in vain against the extraordinary emotion which overcame him at the idea of being in the presence of this noble young lady, so beautiful and so learned. If he were to appear awkward, dare not speak to her, displease her! It would fill him with sadness; for as soon as he had heard the lovely name of the Flower Bird, he had felt a singular disturbance, like the shock of a premonition, and he, who had never thought of women, despising them a little, even, as frivolous and disappointing beings, was forced to admit to himself, with profound surprise, that the mere thought of this unknown princess turned his heart upside down and wiped everything from his mind.
The maid of honour returned, slid open a partition revealing another brightly lit room, and knelt down with both hands on the floor.
Immediately, a great shudder of trailing silks was heard, and the beautiful Hana-Dori slowly crossed the room, letting herself be seen in profile, her head half turned towards the prince.
Indeed, it was impossible to imagine a more ravishing beauty, and the portrait drawn by the Dancing Stork was far from the truth. With graceful majesty and a haughty yet touching expression of strange melancholy, the Flower Bird wore, with charming ease, a magnificent full-sleeved coat of light purple silk embroidered with golden turtles, bamboo and cherry blossom. Over her shoulder, she glanced at the prince quickly, but with deep anxiety, genuflected slightly and walked away. The maid of honour rose and disappeared behind the partition, which she closed.
San-Daï was so moved and amazed that he could only wonder at the meaning of this strange ceremony.
He was alone again: was this the whole reception? Wasn't she coming back? He now longed for her presence so much that he felt like crying at the thought that he might not see her again.
But the maid of honour came in from the other side, approached him and said, bowing:
- My lord, you have the good fortune to please my mistress; she agrees to welcome you and will be here in a moment.
- What is the meaning of this?" asked San-Daï; "We're decidedly backward in Kama-Koura!
The Flower Bird entered, half throwing back her cloak, with a coquettish movement that emphasised the grace of her supple body. With tender effusion, she knelt down beside the prince, digging the silk of an embroidered cushion with her elbow, and said to him in a voice trembling with emotion:
- O my lord! you don't know that you are saving my life! If someone else had been here instead of you, or if you didn't have that charming face, that look of velvet and flame, I wouldn't have lived to see the end of this night... I have already refused so many times! It was my right; but it has its limits, and the supreme night was this night. Rather than give in reluctantly, I chose to die. It's such a small thing, isn't it, the life of a being? A bubble of air that forms and rises like a pearl to the surface of the sea, sways there for a moment, iridescent in the light, reflecting space and sky, then bursts without leaving a trace, without causing the slightest disturbance in the immensity of the world. Yet the soul dreads throwing itself, of its own accord, before its time, into the unknown of another life, or exhaling into nothingness; and I confess that I, born and formed for love, would have wept to die before I had known love, O my prince! I was saving myself for you, and I thank you for coming!
He gazed at her in rapt amazement. Following the movements of that exquisite mouth, dazzled by the moist light in those eyes, stirred to the depths of his being by the tender inflections of that voice, he was not surprised by the strange things he was hearing, very vaguely indeed.
As she fell silent, he stammered:
- I had come to see the Prince, your father, to ask a favour of him... yes, a very great favour... to see the precious manuscript... you know... the manuscript of that famous philosopher. I've forgotten his name, but the manuscript is unpublished, it's a real treasure! I was told that you, beloved daughter of the learned prince... oh yes, beloved!... you alone could intercede for me... you alone, for it is quite certain that you are the only one in the world!
Hana-Dori, very surprised, stepped back a little.
- Alas!" she said, "is this young man, so handsome in appearance, and to whom all my soul was flying, drunk, or deprived of reason?
He came round a little.
- I am not mad," he said, "but ecstatic at your beauty.
Forgive me, Princess, if I misspoke. But I told the truth. I left the castle of Kama-Koura, reluctantly leaving my study room, to go and see a very learned daimio, and I was brought here, to his palace.
She stood up abruptly, pale and trembling.
- Where do you think you are, my lord? You are being deceived, that is certain, but I am not an accomplice, and I feel extreme sorrow at playing an unconscious role in the singular plot of which you are the victim.
The prince then remembered all the surprises of his journey and the doubts that had crossed his mind. He saw again the daïmio of Kama-Koura urging him, with insistence, to leave the study, to amuse himself in every way; he saw again the pale face of his worried mother, and the doctor, shaking his worried and serious head, feeling the pulse of the obstinate worker who rejected frivolous pleasures. He understood everything; he guessed that, out of concern, he had been forcibly removed from an overly prolonged confinement and that it was with the master's authorisation that the cheerful Yamato had imagined this implausible fable from the unpublished manuscript. The story of the Buddha, which he had been made to read in the teahouse, flashed through his mind again, and he had no doubt as to where he was.
He stood up, pale and irritated.
- I have been betrayed! They've made a disgraceful mockery of me, treating me like a stubborn child... But do they really think they can amuse me by force?
L'Oiseau-Fleur, very dignified, standing in the superb folds of her cloak which she drew tightly around her, looked at the young man with sadness.
- My lord," she said, "I can only dimly understand what is happening to you; but it seems to me that there is no reason to irritate you too much, since you see the trap in time to escape it. I can help you get out of this place of infamy, since you are not there of your own free will, without your companions seeing you; in this way, they will be the ones scorned, and you will be able to laugh at their disappointment as you return to your beloved studies. All I ask is that you believe me to be perfectly innocent in all this.
- Innocent! That's a word that hardly suits you," he said with an expression of painful contempt.
- Prince, you are wrong to judge me without knowing me... What for you is an insignificant adventure, is for me an irreparable misfortune; and, what will become of the Flower Bird, when you have gone, you will not even know.
- A priceless jewel, thrown into a swamp! Such a dazzling marvel in the mud!" he cried, wringing his hands.
Immobile, paler and paler, her eyes half closed, she said coldly:
- The gate of my garden opens onto a lonely lane; come, my lord, my servant will guide you.
- Princess or courtesan, you are the only one in the world, and it is impossible for me to leave here.
With a leap she was kneeling beside him.
- Is it true? is it true?" she cried. "Knowing who I am, you don't reject me?
- I have never loved any woman, and to my misfortune, Hana-Dori, it is you that I love.
- Would Heaven really grant me such a blessing!
she exclaimed, the intoxication of love where I feared a torment worse than death! But you don't know me, and I want you to know everything about me; perhaps then you will recognise that it is not contempt that I deserve, but compassion.
- Speak, speak," he said, "your voice is delicious; it doesn't matter if your subtle speeches are learned to better seduce.
She closed her mouth and covered it with her pretty hand, white and soft as a camellia.
- Don't say nasty things and don't doubt my sincerity: you'll have proof that everything I say is true, if you do me the injustice of demanding it.
- Instead, cover my eyes with your dear hands, enraptured by your beauty, if you want me to be able to hear you.
She looked serious and a little angry:
- I implore you, listen to me," she said. I have some reason to believe that my blood is as noble as yours.
As a child, during the horrors of the last civil war, I was stolen by servants when my parents' palace was burnt down. The thieves took me to Tokio, that immense city where one can hide so well, and sold me to a former courtesan, married and owner of several Green Houses within the Yosi-Wara precinct. I was brought up in deep seclusion, with extraordinary care and luxury, lavishing money on the most famous teachers; I was cared for like a flower; I was adorned like an idol, adorning my mind as much as my body; but the slightest expense was recorded in a register, and all that gold gradually forged a formidable chain on my freedom, impossible to ever break. When I was old enough to understand, my destiny was revealed to me. I nearly died of horror and sorrow. Alas! they had filled my young heart with the most beautiful sentiments, opened my mind to noble and generous ideas; they had taught me poetry, music, dance, all the delicacies of language and manners; they had made me a true princess, and all to better sell me to everyone! And perhaps I was of an illustrious race!
All my revolted blood seemed to be crying out for it. I had my little children's clothes brought to me, the ones I had worn when I was taken away from my family. If I could discover, by some clue, my origin, call to my aid those from whom I was born, if they were still alive, be redeemed, saved! This little toilet was extremely elegant, made from the fabrics that were still made especially for princes and in which coats of arms were woven; but there were holes where the emblems should have been, which would have revealed my origin; the silk had been cut where the coats of arms had been marked. No matter how many times I unstitched the linings and searched every corner of the fabric, I could find nothing. So I shed copious tears, much to the anger of those whose property I was. They showed me that my eyes were a valuable commodity that I had no right to spoil. So, devouring my grief, I locked up in a box these shreds of clothing, all that remained of my unknown childhood; and I buried with them all pride and all hope. But in my heart I swore I would die rather than give myself without love... And you save me, O my sweet prince, O you whom I waited for and love, for you are like my dream!
- I easily believe," said San-Daï, "that the blood that makes your beauty blossom is the noblest that can be, but does it blossom for me alone?
for me alone? Am I the first to whom you tell your touching story?
- You are the only one, you are the first," she exclaimed. I have the good fortune to be as unspoilt as the snow on Mount Fousi.
- How can you believe it, being what you are?
- Ah, my lord, I have been as jealously guarded as a daughter of the Mikado; except for my teachers and a few old priests, who taught me morals and philosophy, I have never spoken to any man.
- How can I free you, ravishing victim? Tell
what I can do for you.
She smiled with grace and tenderness.
- What you can do?" she said, "love me with all your love, for a few weeks, and then let me die, very happy...
- Don't talk about dying!" he cried, pressing her to his heart.
At that moment, with a prodigious leap, Yamato leapt into the middle of the room and shouted, clapping his hands:
- What do you think of my Chinese philosopher? I see you like him.
Flower Bird had stepped back with a gesture of offended modesty, but she greeted the newcomer.
- What I'm saying," replied the prince gravely, "is that people will perhaps regret having led me to him, that they will find me only too well converted to his doctrine.
- In the meantime, you must celebrate your wedding," said Yamato.
V
EPHEMERAL NUPTIALS
The Dancing Stork had also entered, along with the pretty young girls, and the servants were hurrying over. They brought a small low table, which they placed in front of the prince, and then placed three lacquered wooden bowls on the table; a bottle of sake was then uncorked.
- You see, Prince," said Yamato, pouring the wine into the first cup, "this ceremony is exactly the same as that which takes place when nobles marry. So you will truly be the husband of this beautiful princess... for the whole night.
The Flower Bird took the cup, emptied half of it and gave it back to San-Dai, who drank the rest, while Yamato said:
- This is the first meeting between this handsome young man and this marvellous young girl; may the omens be happy!
Then he filled the second cup, which was emptied in the same way.
- May you live many years," continued Yamato, "and enjoy perfect happiness... until tomorrow morning!
Those present gave a joyous cheer as they repeated the wishes.
The Flower Bird took the third cup and held it up for a moment before drinking, enveloping the prince in a deep and serious gaze. Without taking her eyes off him, she handed it back to him after she had drunk. He emptied the cup in one gulp and put it back down on the ceremonial table with a jolt.
- This marriage, which is nothing but a sham and a game to you," he said haughtily, "is absolutely serious to me. I vow to be the sole husband of the Flower Bird, and that forever.
Hana-Dori seized the young man's hand and wet it with tears, while Yamato, who knew that his companion never swore empty oaths, put on a stunned and appalled expression that made his face look astonishingly long. But he soon shook off his anxiety and laughed:
- If it's a real wedding, the feast will be all the more magnificent. Hurry up! Hurry up! Let's get served! Judging by myself
myself, I prophesy that if they delay any longer, they'll find us all dead of hunger.
Nothing was missing from this nuptial feast, to which the Dancing Stork
Yamato, with the prince's approval.
Countless little bowls, plates and bowls of fine porcelain, laid out on the white mats on the floor or on low tables, contained all sorts of delicate hors-
delicate hors d'oeuvres: marinated seaweed, raw or cooked shellfish, brightly chopped sole mixed with fresh gherkins; then lobsters, rare fish prepared with shoyo, that succulent fermented liqueur; meat and poultry cut into small pieces; pyramids of snow-white rice; then all sorts of cakes, fruit and sweets, and the sake flowed abundantly and also the sparkling wine from France, which gushed out with a noise like a battle. 
Although there were only four guests seated at this meal, the room was full of people. Elegant geshas, famous for the perfection of their dancing and singing, and taikomatis, whose antics, faces and grimaces made even the most serious people laugh, had been brought in. All the pretty maids of the Oiseau-Fleur had also entered, and, standing against the partitions, lined them with the fresh, light-coloured silks of their embroidered toilets.
The jesters, rolling their extraordinary eyes under eyebrows twisted like snakes in fury, unfurling their sleeves in great jerky gestures, frequently striking their knees with their fans, had mimed a burlesque scene.
But then the samisens began to vibrate in a lively, cheerful rhythm, and a gesha took a few steps forward and began to dance.
Her headdress, which imitated the wings of a butterfly, was adorned with large gold pins, beautiful shells and flowers; her dress, of a shaded blue from bottom to top, from the darkest to the lightest, enveloped her every movement in beautiful, supple folds. She swayed, swayed, turned slowly, floating silk banners covered with emblems around her. Then another gesha, beating a drum with lacquer chopsticks, intoned in a high-pitched voice the love song of the First Meeting.
But the Flower Bird interrupted her with a gesture, signalling that she herself wanted to sing.
Then her favourite servant, whose name was Kin-Rau, the Golden
brought her samisen, and everyone fell silent.
With a mannered grace that nevertheless seemed quite natural, she ran her left hand along the long, slender neck of the instrument, and with the help of the ivory plectrum, strummed the taut strings with her other hand. From the first notes of the prelude, everyone recognised the famous song Harousamé, and a murmur of pleasure went up.
She sang in a voice pure and clear, like the vibrations of a jade cup:
"Under the spring shower that drenches its feathers, the nightingale proclaims the beauty of the flowering plum tree.
"The sweet lover has returned from exile to the beloved tree, despite the last snows, the wind and the hail!
"So fragile is his wing and so hard was the journey, that he is all bruised and bleeding...
"With dying eyes, he gazes one last time at the fragrant pink blossom; but he is happy, for he dies in the shade of the cherished plum tree.
"O you, to whom my thoughts always return, be the tree in flower, and I will be the bird! Without a moment's hesitation, I will cross all the perils and trials to die in your arms!
She put such a tender and passionate accent on this last verse that the prince's eyes moistened with tears, while those present cheered enthusiastically.
- Neither Komati, the great poetess, who was so beautiful, nor the illustrious Mourasaki, nor any of the famous princesses have equalled the one who, this evening, fills us with wonder!" exclaimed Yamato, emptying, one after the other, several glasses of champagne in honour of the Flower Bird.
Flower.
The prince declared that he wanted to exchange the kisho with her, the oath of eternal love, written before witnesses, which condemns to death anyone who fails to fulfil it.
Broc-d'Or immediately ran to fetch the writing box and began to dilute the ink. But Hana-Dori defended herself and wanted to be the only one to write the solemn pledge.
- Oh my dear prince," she cried, "what anguish I would be in if you stopped loving me!
And in support of her sentiment, she quoted an outa by the poet Oukou, famous since the ninth century:
"May the traitor die on the spot!... we swore.
That's why I'm crying, because the adored infidel, Heaven will want him to die.
San-Dai took the brush from the young servant's hands and, unrolling the silky paper, wrote first. In handwriting as beautiful as that of the prince, in rare and elegant words, the Flower Bird in turn wrote the sacred oath.
The dances and songs then resumed, with more languor and fever: the sake had flowed, and flowed abundantly, all heads were troubled and, although they kept a reserve of good company, they felt more and more animation and gaiety.
The Dancing Stork was making great efforts to stand up straight and remain dignified; Yamato had imagined making her drink many cups of sake or champagne, and he was extremely amused by the peculiar looks on the old courtesan's face, all white with blush, by her frightened expressions, in anguish at being incorrect, and by the continual flashing of her eyes, heavy with drunkenness. But deep down inside, despite the laughter he was enjoying, the young student felt a dull worry rising: hadn't he succeeded too well? As the prince had said earlier, they might regret having pulled him out of his studious retreat. He would want to keep all those oaths of loyalty, but what would become of that? Wouldn't Yamato be held responsible by the daïmio of Kama-Koura for all the disorder and folly that had erupted in the young prince's life as a result of this wonderful adventure?
He examined them out of the corner of his eye, both numbed by a delicious confusion, unable to take their eyes off each other, exchanging smiles of ecstasy. They had barely touched this beautiful meal, scattering the grains of rice with the end of their ivory sticks, biting into a piece of fruit, drinking a few sips from the same cup. Now they seemed tired of everyone, impatient to be alone.
Then, with a deep sigh, Yamato stood up, dipped his hand into a purse hanging from his belt and threw a handful of gold across the room. Immediately there was a joyous scramble, shouts and laughter; all the pretty dresses, the beautiful headdresses bristling with pins, dragged themselves across the floor in pursuit of the rolling prey.
The jesters took extraordinary strides; there were fights, arguments, buns being undone; then, when everyone was up again, there was a never-ending chorus of thanks and blessings. Some, unable to grasp anything, pretended to weep.
The prince and Flower Bird stood up. The assistants formed a procession and led them to the bedroom.
This fairly large room opened onto a veranda overlooking the garden, which could be dimly seen in a blue glow.
The bed consisted of a large silk mattress spread over several overlapping mats; at the head of the bed were two makouras, a kind of padded stepladder for resting the head on; and a magnificent embroidered satin blanket in the shape of a giant robe was thrown over the bed.
In a corner, surrounded by flowers, stood a gilded statue of the goddess Benten, queen of the sea and protector of lovers. A small bronze lamp burned in front of it, but the light from many lanterns veiled in white silk prevented its glow from being seen.
The prince was undressed and dressed in a night costume, while the brazier, the perfumes, the box containing the tobacco and the golden pipettes, and, in a precious box, a rare edition of the Pillow Poems were laid out on the floor.
As soon as the young man was in bed, those present, with many wishes for long life and eternal happiness, withdrew, except for Broc-d'Or and a few servants, who began to undress Hana-Dori. They removed her sumptuous cloak of silk and gold, which was laid against the partition on a shelf; they took off the pins and flowers from her headdress; they untied the high shoes that made her look so tall; they untied her belt, fastened at the front in the fashion of courtesans. The dress slipped off, revealing her shoulders and bosom beneath the gauze of the blouse, then her beautiful arms, so white they seemed to glow.
When she was ready, she came and knelt by the bed, and said, in a low voice throbbing with emotion:
- My dear lord, will you allow me to sleep by your side?
Without having the strength to reply, he drew her close to him with a sudden, passionate movement.
Then Broc-d'Or, as the maids turned out the lights, closed the green silk gauze mosquito net over them, enveloping them in a dreamy atmosphere, while the soft glow of the moon filled the room and the little bronze lamp in front of the goddess of the sea and of love shone in a corner like a star.
VI
THE TEARS OF THE SMILE MERCHANTS
He has gone, the pretty prince with the velvet eyes, and the Oiseau-
Flower, devastated, thinks of him through the nights and days. After a whole week of wonderful happiness, he has torn himself away from her, but only to conquer her. Certain, now, that she was his alone, he swore again that she would belong to no-one else; and he left, determined to face the wrath of his parents, to fight against their will, to triumph over all obstacles. Yamato, dismayed and full of dread, followed him, promising nonetheless, as the primary cause of the whole adventure, to serve his noble friend to the best of his ability.
And there she is, among the flowers, sitting in the outer gallery of her house, the beautiful loner, reliving her happiness, and so wrapped up in burning memories that she is still happy in her sadness.
But suddenly, on the ground floor, there is the sound of clear voices and the clanking of high wooden shoes being untied.
- What is it?
Broc-d'Or entered quickly, bent down and looked over the banister of the staircase.
- The most famous oirans of Yosi-Wara," she said, "who have come to visit my noble mistress.
Already, the proud courtesans were slowly climbing the precious wooden staircase, while their attendants, who had remained below, were chattering amongst themselves; and there was the sound of a birdcage throughout the house.
L'Oiseau-Fleur (the Flower Bird) has risen and is also returning to receive her visitors. She raises her right hand and hides her mouth behind her long embroidered sleeve, which is a cuddly and gracious way of greeting.
The first to enter is called Ko-Mourasaki, Petite-
Purple. She is very proud of herself. She is much sought after, but her conquest flatters the ego more than it charms the heart.
She has a long, aristocratic face, very white, a hooked nose, large eyes, barely slanted, with shaven eyebrows, painted high on the forehead. As her teeth are not very beautiful, she has had them lacquered black, like many women of the world, and her smile is singular. In her toilette, she affects a certain tasteful simplicity. Her dress, made of olive-coloured crepe, has no embroidery other than a border of waves, in lighter satin, reaching halfway up her legs and, near her shoulder, her coat of arms, which she has chosen as a bizarre zigzag, enclosed in a circle; her supple belt is of plain pink silk, and on her coat, covered entirely by a fantastic black dragon, the only gold to be seen is in thin threads, indicating the scales, and, in pearls, to form the eyes.
Ko-Mourasaki holds in her hand, like a baton of command, her thin silver pipette.
She is followed by Tama-Koto, the Jade-Guitarist.
Jade, long, frail and pretty, extremely dreamy and nonchalant.
She is dressed in a pale blue dress, so supple that it looks wet: her cloak trails far behind her: on it, embroidered in natural colours on a gold background, is the portrait of the handsome Nari-Hira, the illustrious poet, the proud warrior, the incomparable seducer. The young courtesan has a great passion for this hero of yesteryear; she often weeps for him at night, for through the centuries it is he she loves.
Ko-Tsio, the Little Butterfly, and Vaca-Yanaghi, the Young Willow, enter together. The first is pretty and graceful, with a round, cream-coloured face, cheerful eyes and an exquisite mouth like a small, blooming rose. Her head is bristling with pins, and she seems to have difficulty dragging her toilet, which is heavy with embroidery. The second is a kind of idol, with an immobile, pallid face and long, half-open eyes that seem lost in a dream. Her dress is of yellow silk and her cloak of gold brocade, strewn with silver chrysanthemums.
After exchanging greetings, the beautiful visitors sit down on the snow-coloured tatami mats covering the floor and lean back on the rich cushions scattered here and there.
- We have heard of your happiness," says Ko-
Mourasaki, and we have come to congratulate you. Our whole town is rejoicing with you, and you have been proclaimed Queen of Yosi-Wara!
- I'm very flattered by this attention," replied the Flower Bird.
My happiness is indeed extreme; so great that it helps me to bear the sorrows of absence.
- So it's true!" exclaimed Jade Guitar, "a prince as handsome as Nari-Hira was your first lover and he wants to free you to make you a princess?
- It's really true. The goddess Benten, whom I've prayed to so much, has granted me this insignificant favour.
- Show us the gifts the prince has given you, they must be magnificent," said Little Butterfly, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.
Flower Bird pulled from the folds of her belt an elegant dagger with a silver sheath inlaid with gold.
- This is her only present," she said.
Then came the exclamations:
- A dagger! Nothing but a dagger! Isn't this handsome prince generous?
- Since he gives everything, gifts are superfluous," said Ko-
Mourasaki.
- The prince has bought my freedom until a fixed day, when he must return to take me away," said the Flower Bird. "If, by some misfortune, which heaven forbid! he is kept away from me, who has fallen back into slavery, they will try to force me to be unfaithful! Then this dagger will be the key to my prison; thanks to it, I'll be able to escape from here and wait for my beloved in the abode of shadows.
There was silence. All the beautiful oirans were pensive, and Ko-Mourasaki, bending over the dagger, examined it attentively.
The kameleos, young maids aged twelve or thirteen, had brought the smoking tins and served the tea. The brazier was passed from one to the other, and thin blue spirals rose towards the ceiling.
Ko-Mourasaki was still looking at the dagger; she had pulled it halfway out of its sheath and was trying out the edge on her pretty finger.
Then, with a quick movement, she extinguished the cruel glare of the blade in the shadow of the scabbard and said in a deep voice:
- Death! Voluntary death, allowing us to evade a tyrannical order that humiliates us, is the only way to restore a little true nobility to us, poor simulacrum princesses that we are!
Little Butterfly clapped his hands together in horror:
- But it's awful to die," she cried, "we're so careful of ourselves, so delicate, so cosy!
How could we harm ourselves with daggers or poison? That's an impossible thing, it's never happened.
- Never happened!" said Ko-Mourasaki with a black smile. "We wouldn't get anywhere if we told the stories of suicides that have taken place within the walls of the Yosi-Wara alone.
- Do you know any of these stories?
- We know them all.
- Oh please, tell them," said Little Butterfly with an air of pleading affection, "I don't know any.
- If Flower Bird, our queen, thinks it's a good idea, I'll tell you what I know," said Ko-Mourasaki.
- I will listen to these stories with the greatest interest," said the Flower-Bird, "and perhaps I will add one more to the collection.
- Don't have such ideas!" cried Young Willow; "predicting misfortune attracts it. But I'll give you an infallible talisman, and your prince will return.
- Thank you, a thousand times over; I'll wear it with gratitude.
- We're listening," said Little Butterfly, turning to the imposing Ko-Mourasaki.
She took a sip of tea and put her cup back on the tray.
- The person I'm going to tell you about," she said, "you all knew her. We called her The Pearl.
- Of course we knew her," said Guitare-de-Jade; "she died less than a year ago, in the full flower of her beauty.
- But for fear of setting an example, we carefully hid the way she died. I, her closest friend, was warned in secret by her favourite companion, and I knew the whole truth.
- I had always suspected that this death was not natural," said Young Willow.
VII
WESTERN BARBARIAN
Ko-Mourasaki said:
- The Pearl was extremely beautiful, very proud and very learned.
Like you, Jade-Guitar, she had studied ancient history with a passion, and retained, to the highest degree, the love and pride of her country. None of them looked like princesses of days gone by. She studied the fashions of the past with extraordinary attention, copying them down to the smallest detail. Everything in her house bore the mark of bygone days; she had pages and squires dressed in armour and armed with sabres. Better than any of us, she spoke the Yamato idiom, the language of the eighth century, never mixing in any modern expressions, and, when they were not noble, she embarrassed her one-night stands to the point of making them lose their composure, by mockingly spouting speeches they understood nothing.
Because of all this, she was extremely famous. People talked about her from one end of Tokio to the other, her portraits were exhibited everywhere, and she was even photographed, as a surprise, because she would never have consented to such a thing. Naturally, everything modern horrified her, and she treated young men in ugly Western clothes with such contempt that none of them dared to appear before her without having changed back into their national costume.
One evening, La Perle was informed that a very rich lord, in love with her on the strength of her portraits and reputation, wished to see her. Without delay, she sent for her maids and prepared for the presentation.
Ko-Mourasaki struck her silver pipette on the rim of the lacquer box to knock off the ashes, then continued her story:
- The Pearl moved slowly forward, as is customary, to cross the bay opening onto the reception room. As she passed, she glanced over her shoulder at the man before her. Her eyebrows went up, her mouth tightened in contempt and, without even bowing, she hurried past, signalling to her maid that she refused the man. He was a Westerner, a tall, red-faced man with a big nose, round blue eyes and a bushy, dishevelled red beard that made him look like an animal. La Perle had returned to her room, very irritated. With the tip of her fan, she scattered the flowers from the bouquets, even broke some precious vases and threw her ceremonial coat away.
- How can anyone insult me like that?
she cried, to me who love my country above all else, and who suffer from the new customs, so much so that I only live in the past?
How could anyone think that I would welcome this stranger, for whom my whole being is filled with disgust?
And she scolded her maids for not having warned her. If she had known, she would not even have let herself be seen.
The next day, the stranger showed up again, but La Perle, now on her guard, didn't want to appear. She told him that if he came back every day of the year, she would always refuse him. The poor woman forgot all too well that she was a slave. Those on whom she depended came to admonish her. She had ruinous fantasies. Her house, built in the style of an old castle, cost enormous sums; envoys ran all over the empire to buy her antiques, which were becoming rarer and rarer. His debt was frightening, and his whole life would not be enough to pay it off without the chance of an extraordinary opportunity. This fabulously wealthy Westerner, who had been infatuated with her, especially since he had seen her, wanted her at any price, and any price was not just a figure of speech: he was capable of freeing her completely, of paying everything she owed. If she refused such a bargain, they would be obliged to sell everything in her house, to strip her of her title of oiran, to expose her, along with the courtesans of lower rank, behind the bars of the shop windows.
La Perle bowed her head, she had no choice but to submit. She declared her consent to receive the foreigner. He ordered a magnificent feast and summoned famous actors, who acted and sang, accompanied by a full orchestra.
La Perle, motionless and mute, touched no food, looked at nothing; not once did she raise her eyes to the stranger; she kept them stubbornly lowered, pale, frozen, frightening like a ghost. When the feast was over, she got up and went to her room, as if to change her toilet. Almost immediately, her assistant joined her, but as soon as she reached the threshold, she let out a terrible scream that made everyone present shudder: La Perle lay in a lake of blood.
She had cut her throat with an ancient sword that had belonged to the shogun Taïko-Sama!
All the oyrans gasped in horror; Little Butterfly hid his face, screaming, against the shoulder of Young Willow, who alone had not lost her idol-like impassivity, and only parted her thin lips, adorned with a golden line.
- La Perle deserved to live in the heroic times she loved so much.
- In fact, that's all she loved," said Ko-Mourasaki.
- That's precisely what surprises me most," says Jade Guitar. How could she have found the courage to die such a cruel death, simply because she loathed a being from another race? She had no love for anyone, and it seems to me that love alone gives the desire and the strength to die.
- How do you know that?" asked Little Butterfly; "you've never been in love.
- No one is unaware that I gave my heart over to an impossible passion for a divine poet who died nine hundred years ago. This preserves me from all weakness, and allows me to feel nothing but peaceful indifference towards all the men I meet.
But if I had to give up my dream, deny my ideal lover, I would prefer to die. If a prince even offered to marry me, I would do as the Silk Teal did.
- What did she do? Tell me! tell me!" cried Little Butterfly, who still wanted to be scared.
- Don't any of you know the story of La Sarcelle de Soie? She's famous, though; people often talk about this heroine, and her portraits are still on display at the Yosi-Wara.
- I've heard her named," says Ko-Mourasaki, "but I only know part of her story.
- If our Queen allows," said Jade Guitar, bowing, "I'll tell you what I know.
- I am curious to hear what you have to say," replied Flower Bird.
VIII
THE WEIGHT OF GOLD
- It happened at a time when lords still carried swords, when Japan, closed to foreigners, jealously guarded the traditions and scents of times gone by... Thirty or forty years ago, perhaps, Sarcelle de Soie was, like all of us, beautiful, carefree and a slave; she was solely occupied with taking care of herself, her toilet, her hairstyle and the upkeep of her house. None of the men she received had managed to touch her heart, until the day she met the samurai Kaïdo. He was the vassal of a very unhappy prince, who had been defeated, after long battles, by a rival house, had seen his states invaded, his castle devastated, his treasures plundered, and had fled, with his family, who knew where. The ruin of the master naturally meant the ruin of his servants, and the charming Kaïdo was very poor.
When he came to Yosi-Wara, he accompanied a friend who was wealthier, and was only invited to supper. But Sarcelle de Soie, touched in the heart for the first time, had eyes only for him. She even improvised an outa for him:
"I can't say his name, but, oh joy, there is a young man here for whom I would gladly give my life!
Kaïdo, who was also very moved, had understood, even though he feigned indifference. He returned in secret and became Silk Teal's adored lover. She didn't want him to remain poor; she became greedy, to be able to enrich him. She was passionately in love, happy and full of hope for the future: the young samurai had promised to free her and marry her as soon as he could secure a position. But this was not to be.
The sovereign prince of Satsouma saw the beautiful oïran and fell madly in love with her. He declared that he wanted to make her one of his wives, and that he was ready to pay whatever was demanded.
This news threw the two lovers into despair: it was the end of their love, an eternal separation. The Prince of Satsouma was too powerful to be resisted: they were lost.
However, Teal of Silk, trying to fight back, had the idea of asking an extravagant sum for her redemption: she declared that she would only follow the prince on condition that he paid her her weight in gold. The lord of Satsouma, who was a lord like no other, made no objection. He ordered scales to be built and fixed the day of departure.
When the day came, a dismayed Teal of Silk stepped into the scales, praying to heaven that the weight of her grief would make her heavier than lead. She filled her sleeves with stones and all sorts of heavy objects; but the prince, impassive, had the gold piled up on the other tray, and soon Sarcelle de Soie, clinging to the ropes, was lifted very high.
She no longer belonged.
She had to leave and eat her tears. A magnificent procession took her from the Yosi-Wara to the port, where a beautiful junk, decked out in the prince's banners, was waiting.
Her eyes filled with tears, Sarcelle de Soie watched the shoreline recede and the city disappear, where her heart had remained. She couldn't believe that it was all over, that Kaïdo wouldn't do anything to see her at least one last time.
A boat had broken away from the shore, light and fast; its sail inflated, it flew across the sea, approaching the heavy, majestic ship very quickly. The poor lover looked at the boat with all her might: she was sure it was he who was driving it. But the prince had approached, a cup of sake in his hand.
- My princess," he said, "drink to our love.
She could already make out Kaïdo's pale face; the boat was close by and his lover was holding out his arms to her. Then she understood what he wanted from her. She drained the cup in one gulp.
- Yours, Kaïdo," she shouted.
And she leapt into the sea...
- Dying for someone you love seems to me to be as simple as breathing," said Young Willow, the one who looked like an idol; "but what I think is more terrible is to endure despair, to have the strength to live, with a dry heart, to fulfil some secret plan, or to obey a beloved dead person. Because of this, the story of the Unknown Princess is the one that comes back most often in my mind, and then my throat tightens, I breathe with difficulty, and I stop myself from crying.
- You have always refused to tell us about this adventure, which only you know about," said Ko-Mourasaki, not without bitterness. "The mystery surrounding the woman known as the Unknown Princess has preoccupied all the oïrans of Yosi-Wara, and has made every head work. As time goes by, it eases a little; distance tightens its veils, and oblivion doubles them; however, they are still light enough for the slightest breath of memory to sweep them aside and discover, as vividly as in the early days, the interest inspired by this story, which has never been told.
- Since Vaca-Yanaghi was the first to tell it," says Guitare-
she owes us the story of the Unknown Princess. You don't put gold back up your sleeve after showing it to beggars.
- Let our queen order, since she is all-powerful," said Little Butterfly; "let her help her subjects' curiosity.
The Flower Bird turned and smiled at Young Willow, whose impassive, pale face with half-closed eyes looked more than ever like the alabaster face of an Idol.
- I confess that I have often dreamt about this mysterious princess," she said, "and my royal curiosity joins that of my people.
- It was my intention to tell you the story," replied Young Willow, "only Ko-Tsio's great youth makes me hesitate, for I must ask you to swear an oath not to repeat any of the things I am going to reveal to you; and will she be able to keep her promise, almost still a child as she is?
Like a snake curled up in the silky circle of its robes, Little Butterfly stood up, his eyes full of anger.
- The child who, earlier than others, earned the rank of oiran," she said in a quivering voice, "undoubtedly had qualities that women who were less fortunate took longer to acquire.
She was charming, in her defiant attitude, with the large golden disc, formed by her comb, behind her neck. The courtesans, stretched out on the mats from the bottom to the top, admired her with smiles.
Only the Idol, as impassive as ever, did not raise her head.
- Don't be angry, Ko-Tsio," she said, "the young stem, more beautiful than the made branch, is not irritated by being fragile. There is remorse in my concern: the one from whom I have the mysterious story betrayed the secret out of weakness for me; and, you see, I am going to betray him too, out of friendship for you, I who am the blossoming flower and no longer the graceful bud.
- Do you want me to leave?" asked Little Butterfly.
- I wanted to make the gravity of the oath resound a little louder in your memory; now I'm at peace," said Young Willow.
- Thank you, I who fear death, I swear that I want to die if I am not faithful.
And with a sudden, supple movement, Little Butterfly lowered himself again into the swirl of his robes.
- We are listening to you, Vaca-Yanaghi," said the Flower Bird.
- Send the kamelos away," said Young Willow.
And only when all the young girls had disappeared, through the gap in a panel that the last one closed over her, did she begin.
IX
THE UNKNOWN PRINCESS
- One evening - more than twenty years ago and none of us was out of childhood then - an elegant norimono, but without insignia, entered the grounds of the Yosi-Wara, carried by two men who hid their faces under the headdress of a ronin [2] and who left, taking the vehicle with them, as soon as the woman in it got out.
She was a young woman, very serious and very beautiful, of the purest aristocratic type.
She summoned the housekeeper of one of the main green houses and, with the haughty air and nonchalant, disdainful speech of a real princess, declared that she wanted to be enrolled in the phalanx of fictitious princesses. It was an order rather than a prayer: the governess was tempted to prostrate herself, her knees bending of their own accord, all the more so as the stranger asked for no payment for her commitment, offering on the contrary a substantial sum for her installation expenses. She set out her conditions, for example: she would be admitted to the rank of grand oiran from the outset, and would only receive men from the principality of Hikone, and only once. The governess was ecstatic and agreed to everything.
And for several years, long and heavy no doubt, the unknown woman lived at Yosi-Wara, under the name of Glaive-Noir, which she had chosen for herself.
Mysterious and sad, off-duty, she spoke to no one and, perhaps because of this, people spoke only of her.
How many people stooped to lies and swore they were born in Hikone, in order to be admitted to her! After the only meeting, they all fell silent with inconsolable regret.
One morning, when the kameleos entered Glaive-Noir's house, they found their one-night lover's throat cut across the bed.
They fled, screaming, and soon the whole City of Love was in uproar. The police closed the doors of the Yosi-Wara, hoping that the murderess had not yet escaped. But almost immediately she was discovered, face down in a grove in her garden, with a dagger, emblazoned with her coat of arms, thrust into her heart up to the hilt. It was as if she'd thrust it in there with a joyous frenzy, like the key you use to unlock a lock. A triumphant laugh stretched her dead lips, which had never been seen smiling alive.
The coat of arms on the dagger was that of a completely extinct family. The man whose throat had been slit was recognised as a dignitary of the court, and immediately there was silence, the veils fell away, and no one was allowed to question or speak. Glaive-Noir and his victim were taken out of the Yosi-Wara, and nothing was ever known.
Jeune-Saule kept quiet and poured tea into his cup.
All the oirans let out an ah! of disappointment.
- We knew more or less what you've just told us," said Ko-Mourasaki. Don't you know anything more?
The golden spot on Jeune-Saule's lower lip twitched slightly in a tentative smile. She sipped her tea, put the cup back down and continued.
- Shortly after my first love at Yosi-Wara, an old lord fell in love with me beyond my merits. But I didn't much like him, and despite the favourable offers he made me, I didn't decide to accept him. One day I learned that he had been chief of justice and that it was he who had come to make the official observations at the time of the murder and suicide, which were still troubling us. My indifference to him suddenly ceased and, on condition that he told me about the event, I agreed to talk to him.
I made him suffer: torn between his love and his duty, one wanting him to speak, the other ordering silence, he was truly to be pitied. In short, I panicked him so much that he confessed to me that he had in his possession the manuscript found on Glaive-Noir's corpse, in which she herself had recounted, day by day, part of her life. Reading this manuscript was, from then on, the price of my favours and I wanted no other.
- Have you read it?" exclaimed Little Butterfly in amazement.
- The brave judge resisted for a long time. One evening he finally brought the precious scroll and let me read it when we were alone, after I had sworn never to betray him. To sleep he placed the scroll under the mattress. In the middle of the night, I managed to pull it out without waking the sleeper, and, by the dim light of a lantern, I copied it from cover to cover...
- You copied it?
This exclamation escaped everyone's lips, and even Flower Bird leaned forward, her mouth half-open, distracted for a moment from her dream.
Jeune-Saule reached for her hair, causing her heavy sleeve to fall to her shoulder and exposing her arm, white as paper. From the intricate ornamentation of her hair, she removed a golden lacquer case, almost entirely concealed beneath the wings of her bun. With the case open, she pulled out a roll of fine silk and held it in her fingertips.
- The judge died during the last moon," she said, "there are no more witnesses to the oath. And, with a jerk, she unrolled the manuscript, running like a stream of milk over the mats.
- Your silence is eloquent," she added, "I don't need to tell you: listen.
She read.
Fusimi Castle, 1st year of Gengi, 6th month[3].
"After two hundred years of happy peace, civil war broke out, alas!
"O brutal sorrow! Fateful news! The charm of life is gone. A furious buffalo has broken the fence of the enclosure and is trampling on the lovely flowers. Alas! alas! the most subtle feelings are going to be kneaded with mud and blood!
"In the deserted alcove, the strings of the lyre, with a mournful tinkle, break of their own accord!
"Anguish tightens my throat; yet my tears cannot flow: the raging hurricane does not let the rain fall!
⁂
"How can we harden our hearts? How can we regain energy and strength, after these long years of voluptuous softness? The sabres, with guards embellished with golden birds and silver flowers, are no more than ornaments, in silk belts.
"The princes spent their lives contemplating nature.
Nonchalantly leaning on the edge of the terraces, they sang, dreamed, wrote verses on satin. Lovers of all beauties, savouring noble sensations and the thousand nuances of love.
"Sweet, perfume-soaked bodies, how they will be bruised by the heavy, rough armour! How will the delicate hands, imprisoned in the hard horn gauntlet, be able to grasp the spear and the sword?
the spear and the heavy sword?
⁂
"O sons of heroes! Here you stand; proud and indignant; unrecognizable, under the garb of war! Your hearts armoured too, for here you break the interminable farewell of despair!....
"There is nothing left but the sound of footsteps moving away... footsteps with no return... alas!...
"My face to the ground, I bite my hair to stifle my sobs.
⁂
"Shame and pride lift me up, though. Am I going to cry out in pain, like a simple woman from the rice fields, I princess, from the illustrious clan of Nagato, the daughter of honour of our suzerain?...
"Ah! love had just blossomed in my heart... and... without excusing it, love alone explains cowardice.
"What's going on? Where did this blow come from, which annihilates the little I am? I received it, without understanding it. Now you must know, and follow, with your soul, those who fight.
⁂
"Honour to the Mikado! out with the foreigners!" is the battle cry.
"The barbarians of the west, stain the sacred soil of Japan with their presence. Their ships drop anchor in our ports; vile merchants, from these unknown nations, come to trade. But this is just a pretext; they covet our beautiful country and use all sorts of tricks to deceive us.
"The Shogun has had the weakness to give in to these barbarians, to allow them to do what is forbidden, to exchange written promises with them.
"The pride of power led him astray.
"After so many powerful forebears, does the Shogun not remember that he reigns only in the name of the divine Mikado, and that he is only a slave? He has dared to sign agreements with foreigners without the approval of the son of the Gods, and because of this the Tokugava dynasty will be destroyed.
"The breath exhaled never returns to a man's lips.
The Mikado's orders cannot be reported. Not obeying them is a crime that no one has ever imagined. And now that crime is about to be committed.
"Let foreigners be thrown out of our empire, just as dust is swept away with a broom".
Such is the contemptuous order of the celestial emperor. But the Shogun evades it, delays the moment of obedience, on the pretext that there are treaties, and that these barbarians have, in their ships, terrible engines of destruction.
"What a shame! To tremble before foreigners! To fear to anger them, when one dares to displease the Mikado, and all one's divine forefathers!
⁂
"Our Suzerain Matsudaira Daïzen-no-Daïbou, Prince of Nagato, could not endure this humiliation, and it is to our clan, that the honour of having attacked first falls.
"From the castles of Nakatsu and Nokura, which defend the Simonosaki Strait, the batteries fired on foreign ships crossing the channel.
"And because of this, our prince is blamed. The Shogun, followed by his court, went from Yedo to Kioto to prostrate himself before the veil of the celestial throne. With perfidious insinuations he wants to persuade the Mikado that it is necessary to be gentle with barbarians:
"He managed to convince the In-no-Mya (Ist minister) and our illustrious lord must apologise. His son, the charming Nagato-no-Kami, goes to Kioto.
⁂
"Oh how heavy on the heart are the days of loneliness, anguish and waiting! They seem interminable and yet, as all are alike, the months pass, leaving no memory other than that of monotonous suffering.
"In this great castle of Fusimi, apart from the garrison who watch over the walls, there are only women left. Our princess resides at Hagi castle, and we have not been ordered to join her.
"No service calls us any more. The court dresses, like dead beauties in their coffins, lie in their perfumed chests. Who will wake them? When will the rustling swell of satins and brocades undulate over the snowy whiteness of fine mats?
"Alas! it all seems to be over. The perspective of the rooms, through the half-open windows, remains empty. Only the anxious messenger sometimes appears in the distance against the light of the gardens, advancing and bowing, bringing confused news.
"Oh sorrow! gone are the days when we savoured every hour like ripe fruit; when some feast of the spirit was the heart of every day. Then, no grace in our manners, no inflection of our beauty, was without the reward of a glance or a smile. Those we courted greeted us with touched benevolence.
When we prostrated ourselves in homage, we blossomed at their feet like flowers in flowerbeds: the ardour of their eyes was like rays of sunshine. They proclaimed woman to be the armrest of their soul, the ornament of their thoughts...
"Now woman is nothing: her useless beauty is an ignored bloom of spring.
⁂
"The news becomes terrible; the empire is torn to shreds. Nagato's clan, disapproved of for obeying, revolts. Our prince's samurai, have thrown off the helmet and taken up the ronin mask headdress. They travel the roads and fight as free soldiers, to avenge the honour of their disgraced daimio.
Death to foreigners" is more than ever their battle cry.
They slit the throats of these intruders when they meet them, having the audacity to defy our hatred by treading on Japanese soil.
"But the Shogun still supports them; he wants reprisals for the murders, and tries to convince the Mikado that these intruders must be spared.
"Let them be scattered like dust with a broom".
"The great daïmios of the empire rally around the Son of the Gods; others support the Shogun, and the confusion is dreadful.
"Oh, the days of yesteryear! the chrysanthemum festival of last year, when for the first time, between clumps of gold and purple, he who plucked my heart appeared to me, haughty and charming!
"It's the birthday today, and I'm hiding my face, under my tear-soaked sleeve....
⁂
"Will not the Gods descend to earth, to chastise us?.... I cannot believe the frightening message that has just arrived: Nagato wants to march on the sacred capital, attack the Mikado's evil advisors, and regain the master's good graces. The offence he has suffered explains his mad audacity; but such sacrilege will lose him forever. Fire and steel, threats and violence around the palaces that have been the entrance to heaven for twenty centuries! Pious silence torn apart by the clamour and clash of weapons! The Son of the Gods, attacked by a man!
"Unhappy woman, am I not going to blame our prince too? No, no, my breath is his, and it would be sacrilege not to be with him, even as a criminal.
"Here, at Fusimi Castle, we are very close to Kioto, in the very heart of the war.
⁂
"It was true, the attack is decided. Our troops rushed back to the castle.
"All the great chiefs are here; and it is an extraordinary tumult, after the anxious silence of our solitude.
"Is he here? Will he dare to try to see me? Does he keep the fragile flower of love under the hard armour? Will he inhale its fleeting aroma?
"In my home, under the great cedars, I watch relentlessly, at the corner of the balustrade!
⁂
"He has come! Invisible, through the bamboo wood. He appeared to me, in the faint glow of the waning moon.
"At the sight of me, his handsome, stern face softened.... I stretched out my arms. I leaned over the balustrade as he lifted himself to me, using the branches and beams.
"Oh, what a long, passionate, greedy kiss! We drank in all the delights of love at once.
My death will be embalmed with you," he said.
"And he fled!
"Forever! Forever!
"The words struck my heart like a bell.
"Forever! Forever!
⁂
In the middle of the night, it is the departure of the combatants. A rustle, like that of the sea, fills the gardens; from time to time, trumpet calls burst, and, on all sides, red gleams play the fire.
"I can't stand it! Hiding my head in a dark veil, I took circuitous routes to the ramparts and climbed the slope. Many of my companions did as I did, and we huddled together in a trembling group. What an extraordinary sight!
what an extraordinary sight! in the confused light of resinous torches and emblazoned lanterns. For two hundred years, during the reign of peace, all this harness of war remained invisible; we knew it only from the paintings. So here they are, these heavy breastplates; these strange helmets, with bronze masks, bristling with hair, with the sneer on their silver teeth! these whips with golden thongs, these lances with gleaming blades, in so many different shapes, these proud banners blowing in the wind.
"Oh, what a superb and terrible scene in the anguish of the night!
"Like a black river under the arch of a bridge, the army flows under the arch of the gate. The soldiers march with a brisk step that sounds like hail; once they have crossed the moat, they line up in shadowy squares and remain motionless, spear in fist or hand pressed against the muzzle of the new weapon, the rifle from the west. Gleams, like red snakes, rise along the weapons.
"But then, for a moment, the flow dried up under the vaulted ceiling of the great gate, which remained empty, and immediately the all-too-big leaders emerged from the shadows and rode forward at the pace of their horses.
"First, Masuda, who commands the reserves, preceded by the two sacred standards. On one of them is embroidered the image of the divine warrior, Kantoni Daï-Miojin, who came from heaven to subdue Japan; on the other, the portrait of Kora Daï-Miozin, minister of the empress Zin-Sou who conquered Korea sixteen centuries ago.
"Then comes Echigo, governor of the palace where we are, and finally appears Kounishi, the supreme leader...
"He takes the head of the army, and passes, brightly lit by the torchbearers, just below me, and his image is engraved forever in my memory.
"In front of him, we carry the banner of the Nagato clan, where we see the horizontal line surmounted by three balls, which signify the first rank.
"The pieces of his black horn armour are bound with stitches of green silk, and play on the garment beneath, made of Yamato brocade. His war cloak is made of white gauze and dragons, painted in Indian ink on the reverse of the fabric, show through like smoke. He is holding a commander's whip with golden straps. He is not masked, and the fearless, implacable expression on his face frightens me.
"He passes, and behind him, with a noise like a storm, roll two cannons, guarded by thirty soldiers, armed with pikes. And the black armour marches on, almost invisible, reflecting here and there, as if on water, the smouldering torches.
"Fukubara Echigo takes the same route; I see him coming towards me in a brighter light. Beneath his bronze leather war helmet, his proud face exudes an enthusiastic heroism that moves the heart. His scarlet cloak spreads over the horse's rump. On the prince's shoulder I can see his embroidered emblem: the three-leaf clover. Purple stitches attach the pieces of armour.
"He has already gone past with the banners, with cannons behind him and five hundred breastplates following him. But Him, Him! I have not had the painful pleasure of seeing him. No doubt he is with Masuda, who has taken another route.
"And all this army, accompanied by great dancing shadows, like black spectres, and clouds of red smoke, sank into the night and disappeared...
"For a long, long time, we listen to the great rhythmic noise, which moves away.
⁂
"How painful it is to be a woman, on such days! Our suffering, stagnant and vain, is almost impossible to endure.
"We have gathered, all of us, in the central palace; unable to remain, alone, in our reserved pavilions.
"Oh, the feverish tramping through the empty rooms, the cold clenched hands, the sudden stops of the heart at the entrance of a messenger.
"From hour to hour he must come to us, to prevent us from dying of anguish. Hardly has the sun risen, and here is one already.
"He has prostrated himself and it seems to me that his tears are running down the white mat.
"We tremble as we wait for him to speak, without daring to question him.
"The Holy City is full of fighters who have rushed to defend the outraged Mikado. Faced with the danger, the Shogun has submitted; all his samurai are there, and the daïmios of the Tokugava family command their troops!
Stotsubachi, Echigen, Kouvana, Aidzu. The prince of Satsuma has sent soldiers, and the prince of Chikouzen is himself guarding one of the palace gates.
"The most hateful adversaries rub shoulders and forget their quarrels; with their bodies they shield the son of the gods.
"The messenger knows nothing more; the small number of attackers in the face of this formidable defence makes one shudder.
While he was still speaking, the cannon began to rumble in the distance.
"With an irresistible burst of energy, we left the rooms again, running through the gardens; and here we are again on the battlements, leaning between the battlements. Since we can hear, we think we can see too, but all we can see is the endless countryside, smoking pink in the rising sun.
"Oh that crimson globe against the silver mist! It looks like the standard of Japan, unfurled, by the gods themselves, above the sacred city!
⁂
"In the raised dust, a rider, whose horse seems carried away.... He passes beneath us, crosses the sounding bridge, and rushes under the vault.
"Tightening my dresses around me, I run between the cedars on the platform, to find out more quickly; ahead of my companions, who, their toilets scattered, are fighting against the wind.
"At the feet of the old governor, the messenger, wheezing, tries to speak; the horse shakes on its legs and sags.
- Our great chief, Kounishi, has entered Kioto with an impetuous rush, forcing his way through the Nakada-Kiuri gate, guarded by the Prince of Chikousen. The victorious soldiers drove the enemy back to the ramparts of the sacred palace; they attacked the Gate of the Lords, defended by the Aidzu princes of Kouvana with their best troops. But those of our clan triumphed despite their small numbers; on the heels of Aidzu and Kouvana, who fled, they crossed the holy gate and entered the mysterious gardens."
"Is it possible then?... at this very hour, the clash of weapons brutally tears the secular silence! arrows and bullets slice through the sweet flowers, which exhale their perfumes! smoke stains the purity of the air, and the goddess Amateratzu, divine ancestress of the Mikado, armed with her radiant spear, does not descend from heaven, irritated and terrible!...
⁂
"I can no longer leave the postern. We wait there for the messengers. The faster we hear their breathless words.
"We are all grouped around the governor, in the draught of the vault which cools our fever. The maids of honour chatter nervously, elated by the victory.
The old governor does not speak. Straight and stiff with anxiety, he looks out at the road with pale eyes.
I'm silent too. No words could pass through my tight throat. It seems to me that my heart is letting a red waterfall escape.
⁂
"-The Prince of Satsuma came to Aidzu's aid. Nagato's victors, one against ten, have been thrown out of the Lords' Gate, and a fearful battle is taking place, even as we speak."
"The last man in, sobs this news.
"Victory has already been wiped out by defeat.
"The messenger goes on to say that the daimio of Issé, who had crossed the Idogava with his followers, has crossed the river again and gone away, not wishing to fight against those of Nagato.
"While we were listening to him, the sound of galloping on the road rushed us to the drawbridge.
"A group of squires approached, spears in fist. One of them respectfully carries something wrapped in a banner; blood drips through the cloth; a trail has curdled on the chest and on one of the horse's legs, O!
the heroic and terrible episode! We all prostrated ourselves on the flagstones of the courtyard, to welcome with dignity the precious burden: the head of the chief Matabaï.
"There it is, in the banner, stretched out on the ground, the colour of wax, eyes closed, eyebrows furrowed, and our tears flowing as we listen to how this dear head has gloriously fallen.
"Wounded to death, Matabai is abandoned by his soldiers, who retreat.
Remove my head, at least, and take it away," he cries, "don't inflict this shame on me, of leaving it in the hands of the enemy!"
"The melee is terrible, we hesitate.
Stupid and unworthy warriors," he shouted again, "you will be dishonoured with me.
"His nephew has heard him, and leaps over the dead and the living, striking with his sword in fury: he reaches the wounded man, cuts off that noble head, and manages to escape.
"A great thrill runs through me - of enthusiasm? or horror? - I don't know. I see the young man again, that very night, bent over his horse, raising his dark eyes to the face of the Matabaï chief, who is speaking to him quickly. I can see the hand clutching the reins to keep the unyielding horse in line, the gleam of the stirrup in the torchlight and the opacity of the night all around. This child must have done this awful thing, and for that he is glorious, forever!
⁂
"Wounded, dying, in mournful procession, now; across the horses, on boughs, they are brought to the castle. The halls fill, and in an instant the white mats on the floor become red mats.
"Our hearts twisted in despair, we tried in vain to relieve the pain. Our frail hands cannot stop all the blood! Oh, the frightening faces of suffering!
the frightening faces of suffering! the pallor of the damned!
And yet, if we hear any moans, not one of these heroes lets out a groan.
"Our supreme leader, Kouniski, is defeated and crushed; his soldiers are routed.
"Masuda laid siege to the palace of Takatsu-Kasa, defended by the prince of Hikone; the battle there was terrible; the duels between the men of Nagato and those of Hikone were so formidable that the combatants stopped to contemplate them.
"Echigo is still resisting the Ogaki samurai; he has taken two cannons from the enemy. But someone says they saw him fall from his horse, badly wounded, and carried away in a litter.
"Jo-hi! Jo-hi! (excluding foreigners) is it really for these despicable beings, for these strangers hunted like dogs, that such massacres take place, that all the sons of Japan, as if seized with madness, slit each other's throats?
⁂
"Oh, what is this? These cries, this tumult... perhaps, in my feverish sleep, a nightmare that awakens me?
"No, no, it's the reality, even more dreadful; the army, what's left of the army, fleeing, pursued, entering the castle in disarray.
"From my window, I can see the soldiers pouring into the gardens, dragging the dead and wounded, whom they lay on the lawns...
And Him! Him! Oh, oh!
--------------
⁂
Pavillon des Perles Rouges.
To the Yosi-Wara!
--------------
"She is a dead woman, taking up the brush again, after so many days, fallen upon her, like stabs in inert flesh.
"I owe it to Him to write again so that the truth may be known, and if I have been able to carry out His order.
"Hell! I have passed through it, but without reaching the void: I am in a place worse than hell, and it is by my own will that I am there.
"With a gloomy eye, I reread the jumbled characters on the silk scroll that I threw there hour after hour during the terrible day.
"They ceased with the cry of pain that tore me apart when I saw him, carried by two ronins, his eyes closed, so pale that it was as if a moonbeam enveloped him.
"I was beside him almost immediately, not knowing where I had gone, dishevelled in my night clothes.
"No! He suddenly opened his eyes, as if awakened by my sobs, his eyes ablaze with frightening anger. He saw me, he recognised me. His lips, already closed in eternal silence, parted, a hasty breath lifted his chest, he wanted to speak.
Overcoming my pain, I put my ear to his mouth...
- If you love me, avenge my memory. A man from Hikone, a coward, hit me from behind while I was already wounded and fighting a loyal opponent. The latter, disdainful of this action, turned away, and I was able to grab the infamous man by the throat and look him in the face. My strength betrayed me. Avenge me, and then come and join me, for eternal love!
- The man! The man! What's his name? Already her voice was no longer obedient, her lips were moving in silence. What anguish! His eyes widened with a horrible stare. Did he even see me? He closed them, then opened them again and, with a supreme effort, stammered.
- No name! Armour torn off... Under the breast... a tattoo... three cherry blossoms...
- Three cherry blossoms! Did I hear that right?
Her eyes said "yes" and immediately the breath of death blew its mist over them, dulling them forever!...
⁂
The crushing burden of life, it had to be borne, saved even, with great difficulty, for death stretched out a thousand arms to deliver me from it.
The horror around me left me as insensible as the bronze chimera sitting at the foot of the stairs could have been.
The assault on the castle: Hikone, Satsuma, Aidzu, screaming at the gates; the desperate defence of the heroes, - who would not have been taken alive,
- the rales, the agonies, all this fell, on the fullness of my pain, like water in an overflowing bucket.
The fixed idea, like a thorn in my forehead, sank in, stinging, "three cherry blossoms... a man from Hikone".
Harassed by these words, I acted mechanically, with precision, dressing as if for a trip, gathering precious things that were easy to take with me.
How could I escape? How could I stay alive? Heavy waves of smoke began to creep into the gardens. The besieged were lighting bonfires and surrendering themselves to the flames to escape the victors.
The castle was like a walled tomb. Was I going to disobey? A flaming torch was thrown under the pillars of my pavilion, which caught fire and cracked. I climbed down through the suffocating smoke.
- Not to die!
I skirted the stream, reached the pond and, untying a boat, pushed it towards the middle. The fire wouldn't catch me there, the surrounding trees, weeping over their burns, extinguished them.
Through the smoking ruins; the victors let me pass, laughing at me, sending me mocking compliments. The Hikone banner was flying... He was among them, no doubt, the man with the cherry blossoms! Oh, why can't my eyes see through the armour? How can I pull aside the tunics, to expose the breasts?...
⁂
The answer came to me, suddenly, as I passed through a burnt-out village.
"Prostitutes alone, can see men naked.... many men!..."
⁂
That's why I'm here, at the Yosi-Wara. A sinister spider, watching, from the edge of its web, for prey, which, perhaps, will never take to its trap.
⁂
Days! months, years! oh, so heavy! how am I not crushed by them? My life is, more often than not, half a
sleep. Plants, in the shade, must vegetate like this!
⁂
These odious presences, which I must undergo, these embraces, this rape of my body, do I suffer from them? No, no more than the corpse, from the touching of the worms.
It's so much the same here, in the princely castles, the ceremonial is so carefully simulated, all the customs are so well observed, that for fleeting moments I believe I'm still there, at the residence of Hagi, close to my sovereign. The illusion doesn't last long, but it leaves me with a confused desire to know what has become of her and the illustrious prince, our Master, after so many disasters. How did the war end? What good has come from so much bloodshed?
It seems like centuries have passed in these three long years. All around me, at times, my distracted eyes are surprised by incomprehensible things.
I've made the people around me talk, and it's like chaos in my mind.
The shogunate no longer exists! There are no more sovereign princes!
The new Mikado, seventeen years old, abandoning Kioto and all the divine mystery that surrounded its sanctity, proclaimed the capital of the empire: Yeddo, now called Tokio.
After yet more great struggles, all seemed at peace. Nagato, forgiven and back in favour, becomes prime minister... Then, forever, the cursed foreigners were banished from Japan, since those who had unleashed this terrible war because of them had won a complete victory. Well, no, on the contrary, they're coming in droves now, they're being called, they're being treated like brothers, they want to be like them, they want to imitate them, they're the only ones left!... It's as if they've blown us into a frenzy!
I wouldn't believe any of these sacrilegious stories if I didn't see such strange symptoms all around me.
But what do I care? Nagato is back in grace, that's all I remember.
⁂
O my beloved. I lose all hope and my martyrdom is useless. Never will you be avenged, never will you welcome me, beyond the clouds, to eternal love.
Those three cherry blossoms! Aren't they a vision of your agony? No tattoo has ever appeared to me, on the breasts, bent towards me, for my shame. Perhaps the man from Hikone has been killed too! Well then! Oh, so!
⁂
You should appear to me in my dreams, to console me, to support me. I'm exhausted, in the middle of a boundless desert, so alone, so lost!...
Come and tell me, that you bring back your order, that I can join you; or else, if your irritated spirits still want vengeance, inspire the enemy, push him, drag him here.
⁂
At last! At last! the work is done! vengeance accomplished! I am free!
The man lies there, struck in the back by the dagger I always carried, hidden in my hair.
It's him, all right. Look under his udder for the three cherry blossoms. They will tell you that the man chastised was a coward, that he treacherously struck a noble warrior fighting across the street, a loyal warrior.
He had become a powerful figure, the man from Hikone, he held high office at the new court, he was happy.
So much the better! The dearer his life was, the more joy I took in snatching it from him. He knew why he would die, I shouted it at him, with insults.
O my beloved, I feel your breath caressing me. I'm coming!
I'm coming! but not here, so that my blood doesn't mix with this vile blood.
In the garden, in the open air; so we can fly away faster!
⁂
A long silence reigned, when Young Willow had ceased to read.
All the women, were thinking deeply, about what they had just heard; some were wiping away tears.
Very dreamy too, Young Willow slowly rolled up the manuscript and replaced it in its lacquer case.
Flower Bird was the first to raise her brow.
- After such a terrible story," she said, "we shouldn't tell it any more. It is customary, however, for the queen of the day, who presides over the meeting, to speak after her subjects at the end of the tournament. So I want to comply with custom by telling you, briefly, a story that is different from yours, because there is no question of love. It is a striking example, in my opinion, of our character; and it shows, how much the education, so high, that we are given, can make, in an impure body, noble the spirit, and generous the heart. Here it is:
X
FAN OF RAYS
Mitzu-Vogi (Fan of Rays) was famous, among the great oïrans, as much for her beauty, her unbridled coquetry and her luxury, as for the refinements of her love affairs, and, above all, her arrogance, cruel or cuddly. She pretended that she didn't love, or simulated outbursts of disordered passion that panicked her lovers, without her heart ever beating faster. She devoured fortunes and then threw the ruined man away from her like the peel of a persimmon.
One day, she was told that a woman had asked to see her, to show her some hair arrows, made of coral and of rare workmanship. Just as she wanted to buy some ornaments of this kind, Éventail de Rayons let the shopkeeper in.
A woman, thin and pale, stepped forward and, with a brusque gesture, handed her the box of pins, which trembled in her hand, while she fixed an avid and almost panicked gaze on the beautiful oyran.
The latter, a little surprised, was trying out the pins, when suddenly, with a dull cry, the woman fell to the ground, unconscious.
She was tended to with alacrity, but as soon as the unknown woman regained consciousness Éventail de Rayons ordered all the others to leave.
From the extreme distinction of the person and the sober elegance of the costume, she had quickly guessed that this was no merchant.
- Noble woman," she said to her, "what are you doing here? What ails you so, and what can I do for you?
- I came to beg you to give me back my husband," cried the stranger, sobbing; "but when I saw your triumphant beauty, I realised how many reasons there are for preferring you to all others, and that all I have to do is die!
- Tell me the name of your husband and I swear I'll never see him again," replied Éventail de Rayons. Don't doubt my word: it's the first oath I've ever taken, and I mean it, I'll keep it, you can be sure of that. And now, do not sanctify this impure place any longer by your presence.
The sad wife left, a little comforted.
Strictly, the mad oïran kept her promise. As if to fix the memory, she always wore in her hair the coral pins that the honest woman had left her.
Despite all his efforts, the spurned lover never saw her again.
A few months later, one morning, while Éventail de Rayons was making music in the shade of the tall trees in her garden, she saw the same woman, accompanied by three small children, crossing the little stream on the purple lacquer bridge.
Her pallor had deepened and her features were more pronounced.
- I had guessed that you would not be cured," she said.
You kept your promise, but instead of calming him down, it only made him feel worse. Despair has taken hold of your lover, far from you he thinks only of you, and jealousy devours him so cruelly at the idea that he is exiled, while others approach you, that I have come to return your word, to beg you to extend your good graces to the unfortunate man who is going to die, so that these poor little ones may still have a father.
She pushed the children, deliciously awkward, towards the courtesan, who was stunned and drew them against her, contemplating them for a long time. Perhaps she had never seen children before.
A veil of sadness seemed to fall over her beautiful face, extinguishing her smile, and she said, as if to herself, after a long silence:
- Here then is this tender, sweet flesh that we devour, without knowing it, by melting the fortunes of our fathers in the fire of our kisses. O poor unconscious monsters that we are!
His gaze seemed troubled with tears when she set it on the eyes of the sorrowing wife who had wept so much because of her.
- Since jealousy consumes him and he can't fight it," she said, "let the unfaithful husband come here tomorrow. He'll see me, because he mustn't be jealous any more.
The next day, the distraught lover gazed at a dead woman, all white on the sumptuous bed.
Éventail de Rayons had drunk poison, after drawing these lines on his fan:
"What does the existence of a courtesan weigh against that of a noble family?
"I have done my duty. Let your wife and children dictate yours.
- This death is certainly the most noble and selfless of all those we have spoken of," said Ko-
Mourasaki, rising to his feet. "History does us great honour, it seems to me.
- We thank our queen for telling it to us," said Young Willow.
And as the hour of the receptions approached, the oirans called back their attendants, and after taking leave of Flower Bird, without omitting any of the prescribed ceremonial, majestically descended the staircase and withdrew.
XI
TEARS AND PERFUMES
L'Oiseau-Fleur, lying on the floor with her head in her hands, sobbed loudly, while Broc d'Or, standing and distraught, gazed at the nape of her mistress's neck, which looked like white satin between the blue satin of her dress and the black satin of her hair.
The beautiful princess of love has received a terrible letter: the daïmio of Kama-Koura is absolutely opposed to her release and her marriage to the prince, her son. The courtesan will not enter the castle; the name of daughter will only be given to a genuine princess, descended from a family equal to that of Kama-
Koura. The prince has sworn that he will not give in; but as he can do nothing without the money needed to free his beloved, he will not rebel.
beloved, he does not rebel openly, not having lost all hope of bending his parents' will.
It is this resignation, above all, that terrifies his poor lover...
- Doesn't he think," she moans between tears, "that the time for which he bought my freedom ran out eight days ago, that I'm going to be forced to practise my horrible trade, to hand myself over to the first man who comes along? Of course, I clutch death to my heart with tenderness when I see this; but death is also separation, and when he comes to fetch me, my beloved will weep.
Broc d'Or, leaning towards her, tries to soothe her.
- Lord Yamato has added a few lines to the Prince's letter," she said, "assuring us that he, who has caused the harm, will do everything in his power to repair it. If we manage to gain a little time, he has a plan which, if successful, would save us. The prince is a captive in his father's castle, but Yamato is free and is taking action.
- What do you want him to do? He'll be too late. I won't let the slugs drool on the flower that the beloved butterfly
butterfly has fanned with his wings.
- Let's save time.
- How can we do that?
- Before I was in your service, where I earn nothing, because you are virtuous, I served a great oiran, who welcomed many lords and I received many bouquets from them: they form a pretty flowerbed, which would free the princess of love for a few more months, if she would accept it from me.
- You would give me all your fortune, with the risk that it might never be returned to you... Because it will evaporate very quickly and probably won't be enough...
- What will certainly evaporate, if you continue to cry like this," said Broc d'Or in a scolding voice, "is this ravishing beauty that has won you the prince's heart. Your eyes are red, your cheeks are all marbled, your mouth is twitching instead of smiling.
L'Oiseau-Fleur jumped to her feet in fright and ran to her mirror, which shone like the full moon, its silver disc rounded out amidst carved bamboo.
Broc d'Or clapped her hands together.
- Let's go! let's go!" she cried, "quickly, the princess's toilet!
We'll soon be able to erase the traces of a stormy night, and the beauty will be as delicious and fresh as a flower in the rising sun.
The Kamélos entered, carrying soft cloths and mysterious lacquer boxes fastened with silk cords.
Two servants, completely naked, brought the oval-shaped bathtub, made of lacquered wood decorated with gold butterflies; they filled it with hot water and placed large clumps of flowering irises with their roots inside.
The Kamélos mixed rice flour with the water and poured perfumes into it.
Then the Flower Bird dropped her night clothes and her flesh, like the pulp of water lilies, attracted all the light; she shone, whiter still by the contrast of the deep black lacquers; but, modest, she quickly stepped over the edge of the vat and plunged, uttering little cries, into the water, which was very hot.
Soon, Broc d'Or, following a recipe held in high esteem and even considered sacred, soaked a canvas bag filled with nightingale droppings in the bath water and slowly rubbed it over her mistress's body, making her skin extremely smooth and shiny.
After a while, she was helped out of the water, and after wiping her with soft cloths, she was rubbed again with pumice stones.
Then, wrapped in a soft sheet, she lay down to rest for a moment, and Broc d'Or served her a cup of tea, in which a dried cherry blossom bloomed in the heat, as if fresh. As she drank, the flower gently caressed her lips and she blew on it, with a gentle pout, to ward it off.
After that, the hairdressers came to fix her face and hair. They spread a light layer of egg white over the face and collar, then applied the rice powder with a soft muslin cloth. After shaving off the eyebrows, they drew two black dots at the very top of the forehead and drew a carmine line up the corner of the eye. The pretty mouth was also brightened with red, and then the complicated work of styling began.
The heavy, shiny black hair was untied and rolled down to the Flower Bird's hocks, but after untangling it with combs made of Tsou-Yhé wood and anointing it with deliciously fragrant green Natané oil, it was pulled up as tightly as possible and the wig was placed on top, all arranged in the shape of a butterfly. Gold pins held it in place, and a comb topped with an open-winged silver and enamel stork was fixed in front of the bun.
The hairdressers then withdrew and the dressers came in, carrying a chest with compartments.
With a movement of her shoulder, the Princess of Love dropped the drapery; her white, graceful nudity appeared again, this time singular beneath the voluminous, dressed head.
The red silk juban with sleeves was hastily slipped over her, reaching down to her knees, slit and crossed over her chest, and a sort of apron of similar material was placed over it, reaching down to her ankles and around her legs.
She was then made to put on the shitaghi, the first very light dress, the colour of water in the moonlight; and she was supported as she stretched out her foot to put on the bluish-white silk tabis, with separate toes, and to put on the straw sandals, lined and embellished with silk, with very high soles, held in place only by a padded cuff looped around the toe.
The dress, which that day was made of faint tea-coloured satin and covered with poems embroidered in black in gold squares, was brought in straight away.
When she was ready, she was given a very precious sachet, which she put in her left sleeve. The sachet contained an atom of the priceless perfume known as Janko, or old cat perfume.
Legend has it that this fragrant stone was formed in the brain of a hundred-year-old cat that had been wandering the mountains, where it was chased for a long time. The man who managed to kill it took possession of the embalmed treasure, which he guarded jealously until the day his daughter, in love with a lord, stole half of it to give to her lover. The father went to war with the kidnapper to take back the unique musk, but he was unable to do so.
Between lovers: "Do you want half of my perfume?" is still the most ardent protest, expressing boundless self-sacrifice.
To fan herself, the princess took a rare and fragile case made from the wing of a giant butterfly, and with the help of the kamouros, who lifted the train of her dress up the stairs, she descended to the ground floor and went out into her private garden, where she was required to spend a few hours to breathe the morning air.
It's a large garden in miniature, with a pagoda, rocks, waterfalls, pines and cedars, a pond full of irises, on which the pretty birds called onidori sail.
Sitting under the flower-decked verandah, the princess sighs as she prepares her pipette and absent-mindedly takes a few puffs.
From the neighbouring gardens you can hear the sound of singing.
- Won't you sing too?" asks one of the kamouros, pulling the long-handled chamissen from its silk wrapping.
To mask her pain, to sing perhaps?
She picked up the instrument and strummed the spindly strings with the tip of the wooden plectrum; a sad song came to her lips.
"The snow flutters, like cherry blossoms in a gust of wind.
"The withered flower is still something; but the snow leaves no trace on the shaken sleeve.
"And so the memory fades from the heart.
"In my icy bed I weep, I who never forget, and my tears freeze on the pillow.
"Why is what is so far away so close to the spirit?
"I listen to the silence, in solitude. And then a bell, with hard strokes, rings the hour.
"The hour! the same hour! the midnight that was so sweet!
"The hail pelted my door and I rushed to open it, as if someone were knocking, knowing full well that there was nothing there.
"Nothing but the dreadful, hostile night, black as oblivion.
"I was without hope, but disappointment breaks my heart with sobs!
"Alas! the night of love, where is it?"
- Princess, sing no more, if only to weep more.
And the kamouros removed the instrument. But Broc d'Or returned.
She had been to negotiate the deal with the landlady of the Green House, and it was a done deal. Out of the goodness of her heart, the Dancing Stork let herself be touched. She had confidence in the genius of Lord Yamato, who showed her a great deal of consideration. So she agreed to take Broc d'Or's entire fortune in exchange for a two-month reprieve for Flower Bird.
She was standing there, clapping her pale little hands together.
- Ô ! Broc d'Or! Oh, my sweet companion, have you done this?
May your devotion not be in vain by delaying my death a little. I have already thrown everything I own into the beak of that greedy stork, and all I can leave you is my corpse.
- Let us not mourn the dead when they are alive," said the next woman, "let us not build the future with smoke. If you become a real princess, I will have done a good business; if you don't, I will have done a good deed.
- Noble hearts do not only inhabit noble breasts. If fate is kind to me, I swear you'll never leave me.
- Who knows? I might even marry Lord Yamato. When he was here, he winked at me," exclaimed Broc d'Or, with a burst of laughter. In the meantime, let's not waste any time, write to him about the new arrangement and stimulate his zeal a little; two months goes by very quickly.
As she spoke, she threw a roll of white paper, embossed with flowers and birds, onto the floor, picked up the writing case and washed out the ink.
The princess, kneeling on the carpet and leaning on it with her left hand, picked up the brush and began to draw characters quickly.
XII
THE BARRIER OF GREEN BAMBOO
- Do you want to die? As long as she is alive, it makes no sense. However, if your mind is made up, that's fine... I'll have this kiosk draped in white and we'll perform Hara-Kiri together; unless you prefer to be more modern and use a revolver.
It was at the far end of the park, on the edge of a pond, in front of a ravishing view, that Yamato said these words to the young Prince Sandaï, slumped on the mats, both arms on the armrest and his chin in his hands. In front of the entrance to the enclosure reserved for the young prince, a light barrier made of green bamboo indicates, according to the ancient custom, that the lord is a prisoner.
- What reason have you to leave this life?
- Ask your father, and especially your mother the princess," replies Yamato. People forget that I was asked to do this, and that before I acted I said what I wanted to do. "Yes, yes, to the Yosi-Wara," said the old lord, shaking his head complacently, "I went there often in my youth. It is true that the haughty wife was highly offended, but she did not object. It was a question of saving the heir to the name, whose chastity was consuming him. And now this! Curse, rebellion, tears, suicide, I'm the cause of it all. I've been hunted down, degraded, deprived of pay, distanced from you, as if I were an evil beast. How do you expect us to survive all that, even in this day and age?
- Did you swim in the water of the ditch and climb the wall to get here, since you are forbidden to enter the castle?
- Your long tirade about your incurable despair and impending death has caged my story," says Yamato, "let me open my mouth and give it a volley, but pay attention to its flight; if it's not the bird itself, it's at least an echo of its flight.
Quickly, Sandaï left his overwhelmed pose.
- Do you know anything about her?
- I certainly do.
- You're going to tell me that, having fallen back into servitude through my fault, she is unfaithful to me. No, no, I want to die without having heard that.
- Again!" cried Yamato dejectedly.
- If it's not that, speak up.
- Well, we've got two months ahead of us. Thanks to the devotion of the next girl, who has given all her savings, the Voracious Stork will ensure that your beloved is respected until the reprieve expires. Flower Bird has just written me this, begging us not to abandon her.
- Oh, give me his letter!
Yamato raised his arms to the sky.
- That's what it's about!" he cried. Sobbing and sentimental whining, on a roll of paper, that's all a desperate lover is capable of. I didn't swim in the water of the ditch, I didn't climb the crenellated wall, I crossed the bridge and entered through the gate, and the samurai on duty, or rather the caretakers who take their place, dragged me before the venerable lord of Kama-Koura, who, on seeing me, furrowed his noble brows.
- You dared to defy my father?
- I was as flat as a beaten dog that crawls at its master's feet. I faced his wrath, resigned to endure it; I expiated my crimes without a murmur, the punishment was too just, exile well deserved. But if I dared to appear again, it was driven by the desire to repair the harm I had done, if that were possible... In the end, you should know that I am near you, with the Prince's permission, and the Princess has even given her consent after being consulted... However, since my trust in your accomplice is not boundless, I was searched... If I'd had your adorable friend's letter with me, all would have been lost! But I had foreseen that!
- What are you getting at with your chatter? You're kneading my aching heart like a cake dough; you're hurting me, your laughter rings like a bell rusted by a rain of tears. What's your plan? Say it quickly, we're wasting time. Two months is such a short time.
- Those are wise words, the first ones," says Yamato. It is indeed short and the empire is vast. I'm going to have to cover it in every direction. Without the railways, my project would have been impossible.
- To travel the Empire? For what purpose? To find you a wife of your standing. Don't shout. I have your family's consent, and if I succeed as I want, I'll have yours...
- Never! Never!
- Take back that useless word. This is what I told your father.
Your son is madly in love with the beauty of a woman, you judge in your wisdom that woman unworthy of being admitted among you; if I could find, in a noble girl, a beauty almost like the one the young prince is mourning, it would not be impossible to console him and marry him according to your wishes.
- If that is your plan...
- Shut up, and don't discourage me by doubting my friendship," cried Yamato, suddenly serious. "If I succeed, the bride that the daïmo of Kama-Koura will present to you will be none other than the Flower Bird.
- Forgive me; I'm wicked," said Sandaï, taking his friend's hands. "I don't doubt you, but I'm so unhappy, and what you imagine seems so impossible!
- Just look at what I've already achieved! I've forced my way into the castle; I've returned to grace, to such an extent that your father is going to pay for my travels and give me the means to enter the impenetrable castles of the great families of the Empire. Without him I could do nothing, and now he is providing me with the weapons to fight him.
- To fight him! by visiting all the old nobles, dispossessed of their sovereignty, and who, in retirement, nurse the wounds of their pride? that is what I cannot understand, nor how it will serve me!
- Don't look for it and don't speak any more; the minutes that go by, tremble on my heart... You know what you need to know: the beloved
You know what you need to know: your beloved is faithful and determined to die rather than let the tip of her fingernail be touched by anyone but you. I am making a supreme effort to save you, so you must preserve your precious existence until I am triumphant or defeated.
In that case I will return, stretch out this pavilion of white draperies, and we will open our bellies together, shouting: Blessed be the Hara-Kiri of the good old days, which puts an end to all sorrows.
XIII
TO THE RUSTY SPEAR
Yamato, after a quick run to the Yosi-Wara, and a secret meeting with the Flower Bird, went into a poor district of Tokyo and, having searched in vain for some time, was shown by a police officer in modern uniform the inn
"À la Lance Rouillée". It was a small old teahouse, with worm-eaten woodwork, all black from the drizzle of the rain that was falling that day. It must have been a long time ago, the poor shack, and was hardly in keeping with new tastes; paper tiles were still the order of the day, and it was dark inside, especially on such a gloomy day.
Before entering, Yamato hid his English umbrella in a corner so as not to shock anyone, as he knew that in this place, anything new was abhorred.
The host, an old man with a face bristling with white hair, came forward, greeted him with ancient formulas and bowed, despite his age.
Yamato, with the haughty air of the old nobles, did not immediately lift his bow.
- Your house, I am told, is frequented by samurai, faithful to the past, aged in battle, who disdain vile professions and proudly endure misery.
- Yes, my lord," replied the host, who after great effort managed to get to his feet, "most of those who come here are unsung heroes, who live on memories and die nobly of hunger.
- Do you have visitors at the moment?
- Some of the once famous are here.
- Couldn't I catch a glimpse of them for a moment, without being seen?
The host shook his old head in perplexity.
- We live in peculiar times, my lord", he said, "regretting the past and deploring the present is sometimes an offence, and I cannot allow myself to expose my noble guests to the gaze of a stranger.
- Rest assured, venerable innkeeper," said Yamato, "I am not a member of the police. I was a vassal of the daimio of Kama-Koura in the days, not so very long ago, when there were vassals; in my heart I still am. I would like to ask these Braves about their memories, which, far from hurting them, can only please them. Here," he added, pushing aside his cloak, "I'm in breach myself.
I'm breaking the law myself.
And he uncovered two short daggers hidden in the folds of his belt.
- Why, my lord," asked the host, "do you wish to see the Soshis [4] before speaking to them? Do you think you recognise any of them?
- No," said Yamato. I am twenty-five years old. So I was three years old at the time of the revolution, and I didn't yet have the honour of associating with the warriors. I would like to get a glimpse of them, to try and guess which clans they belonged to, so as to avoid, in my words, anything that might offend them.
- Come then," said the old man, sliding open a panel whose damp wood resisted a little.
The inn was bigger than they thought. They crossed a courtyard surrounded by dilapidated but still solid buildings and climbed two rain-soaked steps. They shook off their clothes under the sheltered gallery.
An initially confused sound of trampling and clamouring became distinct and erupted when the old man pushed aside the door panel as wide as his eye.
A fairly large room appeared, with a bare floor and a low ceiling, where a dozen strange creatures were jousting with spears and shouting at each other.
"Jo-i! Jo-i!" (out with the foreigners), the war cry of the Mikado's supporters during the revolts, dominated.
Yamato, very interested in the spectacle, opened one eye wide and closed the other.
At the back of the room, a thin figure dressed in a warrior's garb was leaning backwards, one leg forward, holding a purple lacquer spear with a sword tip between his thumb and palm, the other pointing with his index finger. Three opponents were attacking him at the same time, wearing similar costumes and armed with similar spears.
With threatening twitches of the eyebrows, leaps, volteys and hoarse cries, the man facing them raised or lowered the shiny blades with a sharp jerk, returned to his defence, attacked, crawled and leapt, with the suppleness of a wild beast and a dizzying skill that made those watching utter admiring "Oh! oh!
from those who stood by, glued to the walls.
- Who's that?" asked Yamato quietly.
The innkeeper put his mouth to the young man's ear and answered in his old, trembling voice.
- He's the brother of the terrible Oï-Kantaro, who managed to escape from Japan after the plot against Minister Ito was discovered. He is also known as Kantaro and is very much disliked by the new society, both because of his brother and because of himself.
himself.
- Those who joust with him! say their names.
- The one in the middle is Nishino. It is believed that he was an accomplice in the murder of Councillor Mori, perhaps because of a similarity in name. He doesn't deny this rumour, which flatters him.
This one is called Koyamo, and he was certainly involved in the case against the Viceroy of China, Li-Hung-Tchang, which did not succeed.
The other is called Sabouro, and little is known about him.
- But they're going to kill him, this Kantaro! Look, he's dripping with blood.
- Ah, their games are the games of the brave," said the old man, unmoved.
- Come on, have a large tray copiously laden with food and sake, and take it to these rough lords; it will make me come.
A few moments later, Yamato was squatting on the floor opposite the fierce Oï-Kantaro, whose bleeding forehead was bandaged with a blue cloth, separated from him by cups and dishes. A light screen isolated them from the others, who noisily drank to their health.
- How many fires after the defeat," replied Kantaro to a question from his new friend, "the count is infernal.
Thirty-seven thousand and four hundred houses, a hundred and fifteen Buddha temples, sixty Shinto temples, eighteen great palaces of the court nobles, forty-four daimyo castles, six hundred samurai mansions, including mine, forty bridges, three theatres, a thousand shops, four hundred poorhouses and even a beggar's village. Don't think I'm exaggerating, this wonderful statistic is official.
- Do you know which are the forty-four castles of the daïmios?
Oi-Kantaro wrinkled his furrowed brow under the bloody cloth, raised his eyebrows and turned his hard gaze to Yamato's eyes.
- What are you afraid of me for?" he asked, after a silence. We'd get there a lot quicker if you'd tell me, without mistrust, what you want to achieve. Nothing is erased from my memory of the events of the war, it still blazes in my eyes and rings in my ears. A detail, insignificant to anyone else, can put me on the trail of what you are looking for. Otherwise we'll be groping around indefinitely and since you're in a hurry...
- I have no other fear than to offend, through ignorance, one of your convictions," says Yamato, "to hurt you unintentionally.
- Go on, tell your story. I'm so well armoured by scars that there's no room for wounds.
- I'll tell it," exclaimed Yamato, pouring sake into the old brave's cup. You know that I am a vassal of Kama-
Koura's vassal, you have no prejudice, I hope, against my lord?
- Kama-Koura remains in his domain and preserves, as far as he can, the traditions; none of his people hold office at court or are involved in modern abominations; Kama-Koura has my sympathy.
- Well, it's a question of saving the only heir to the name from death.
- But how?
- By finding the family of a beautiful woman who was kidnapped when the castle burned down...
- And whom the young lord undoubtedly loves madly. The noble parents reject a girl with no name. We must find her name!
- Precisely.
- Ah! ah! a love story! little glory to reap...
But the problem is fun to solve. Where is the girl?
- At the Yosi-Wara.
- Of course she is. Sold by the kidnappers... How old is she?
- Twenty-two.
- You can see how the circle has already been tightened around the question," said Kantaro, emptying his pipette onto the tray. "All we have to do now is find, among the forty-four daïmios burnt down, those whose children were infants at the time of the revolution.
- Yes, that's right.
- What clue do you have? Is that parcel you're holding close to your hip relevant to the case?
- They are the only witnesses, mute witnesses, who are keeping it a secret.
- We'll find out, bring them in. Let's go.
Setting the dishes aside, Yamato untied the parcel and spread out a child's dress and coat on the floor.
The brave man scrutinised them with a sharp glance and drew them to him.
- We cut out the coat of arms, that was the first thing to do," he said, running his fingers through the holes in the fabric.
A sweet, distinguished fragrance wafted from the folds, overpowering for a moment the warm smell of sake. The fallen warrior inhaled the aroma with painful emotion, and even lowered his eyelids against the mist that suddenly clouded his eyes.
- A whiff of the past that goes straight to my heart," he murmured.
Oh, so close, and so lost! When it was sewn, this little garment, it was the heroic era, gone forever; the fabric is still brand new, and the weft of destiny, torn into a thousand pieces.
The child it clothed is only a young woman; the wounds are badly healed on the soldier's vigorous limbs, and here we are, like ghosts, coming back after centuries to weep over unrecognisable ruins. How much despair I hold in this perfume of yesteryear!
His voice failed him, and he stifled a sob, hiding his face in his child's dress.
Yamato stared at him, his mouth gaping; moved, but rather surprised by this great sorrow that he, born too late to have known this past, so close, yet almost dating back to before his birth, did not find anything to say and only heaved a compassionate sigh.
Oï-Kantaro quickly raised his head, as if ashamed of this weakness; the blue cloth bandage had shifted and blood was flowing in the tears. He wiped his face with a sudden movement and threw the blindfold away from him.
- This is what it's like to drink so much sake," he said, trying to smile; "we're a long way from our adventure, let's get back to it; success is close to my heart now.
He went back to examining the clothes.
- Nothing to show for it, is there? said Yamato.
- What do you think of the pattern of the dress? What shape do you see?
- A jumble of palms, perhaps.
- Palms? No; I see something else, but I wouldn't want to fool myself into thinking I was seeing what I wanted to see.
Look again.
- I see palms, of various shades, in the same colour.
- Palms! I see feathers. Don't you think they are feathers?
- It's possible, if you look harder; feathers or palms, that doesn't get us very far.
- If the palms crumble in the wind and the feathers don't blow away, we might be on to something.
Kantaro rose to his feet, pushed aside the screen and went to show the dress to his companions, who were beginning to warm up to the sake, offered by Yamato to all present but not yet intoxicated.
- Feathers! decidedly," shouted the brave man as he returned.
He closed the screen and sat down again, facing Yamato, who was very interested.
- Are you on to something, then?
- You may have heard that princes often had fabrics woven just for them, based on designs they gave them. This little dress is probably made from a fabric of this kind, because the design is unusual and rare. I have never seen anything like it. The coat of arms, which used to mark each shoulder, has been cut off; if it were returned to its original position, I have the idea that it would show us two falcon feathers, crossed and enclosed in a circle.
- Really?
- This is the coat of arms of the princes of Ako, don't you know?
don't you know?
- It is indeed... of the princes of Ako... stammered Yamato, who didn't know at all.
- Isn't it possible that the idea of using the motif of the insignia to decorate a fabric came more naturally to the designers, who constantly had these insignia in front of them?
- This is very logical.
- There's even another clue. The clan banner was green and white and, as you can see, the feather pattern, in all shades of green, is set against a white background.
- I'm amazed at your sagacity," exclaimed Yamato, truly filled with wonder... so it's the Prince of Ako who would have been delighted with the one we're looking at.
- Let's not be so hasty. I may be completely wrong; but since we have nothing, we must take this conjecture for something.
- So we must go, without delay, to the principality of Ako... which is no longer a principality, by the way.
- Does the family even still exist?" said Kantaro.
Let's go and see, and don't hesitate, as time is running out.
When do we leave?
- This very evening. There's a train at nine o'clock... Would you like to meet me at Uyeno station?
As if bitten by a snake, the brave man jumped to his feet, his face flushed with surprise and anger.
- Me, me, me! To a station!" he cried, "me! climbing into one of those cursed machines! After what you know of my character, is it not to insult me that you make me such an offer?
- Insult you? It was simply to go faster," said a frightened Yamato. How can I travel then?
- Ah, there's the modern gangrene! Didn't we travel, in my youth, when we kept those infamous barbarians out of the kingdom?
- Can't we take advantage of their inventions without ceasing to hate them? Take from them all the means we need to drive them out again, when we no longer have anything to gain from them," said Yamato, conciliating.
But the brave man did not calm down.
- Yes, we'll be closing in on a Japan that's rotten and disfigured, where everything has been destroyed and forgotten, and where all that's left is a bunch of monkeys in ridiculous disguises!
Yamato, terrified by the turn the conversation was taking, hastened to give in.
- Let's travel as you wish," he said, "but let's make all the more haste. Please say what you have decided.
- The horse is the most suitable thing for samurai.
- I should point out that it's raining heavily; we'll get soaked.
- We'll wear straw coats.
- Straw coats?... very good," said Yamato... and he added mentally: "hiding a good American rubber underneath. - So I'm going to buy two horses; it will be much more expensive, but since it's what you want, I'll do it.
- I'm grateful," said Kantaro a little more subdued.
- Where should I expect you?
- At the Gate of the Nobles, behind the Shiba Temple.
- At what time?
- At the hour of the fox; the moon will rise shortly afterwards and light our way.
- I'll be there," said Yamato. Allow me to take my leave, so that I can look for good horses and make all the necessary preparations.
He left, and stealthily retrieved his umbrella from the dark corner, which he hid under his coat, without daring to open it. He walked through the rain as long as he could see the inn.
- Phew!" he sighed, taking shelter at last, when he had turned a corner; "I've done very well to hide this foreign contraption, so much superior, however, to our tar paper umbrellas. And my boots! Luckily he didn't see them; I was always hiding them under my dress! Can you imagine such antiques? Here I am, pretty! forced to trot through the countryside, along rutted paths, fording rivers, taking three days to cover the distance I'd covered in a few hours.
At last! if he has really found out at the first glance which prince we are dealing with, that terrible Kantaro is doing me a great favour, and will have made me go faster even than by steam.
Yamato closed his umbrella as he entered a tram office.
- The hour of the fox?.. he thought, what is it?
Nine o'clock or ten o'clock? Here, I'll ask that old man who gives out numbers.
And he raised his voice to ask the question through the window, because the vehicle was approaching, whistling loudly.
XIV
TO THE PAST
A heavy junk of an old model, almost out of service, opened its straw sail and sailed along an arm of the inland sea, which it was trying to cross, despite the absence of wind.
Oï-Kantaro had naturally not wanted to take the small steamer which serves the ports in these parts, and Yamato, increasingly impatient, was finding it difficult to conceal his bad temper.
More than a month had passed since they left Tokyo.
Faithful to his principles, and not wishing to take advantage of any of the benefits of the new customs, the brave man had created a thousand obstacles, a thousand difficulties, and the journey, hampered at every stage, was dragging on and on. A quarrel, followed by an assault, with some customs officials almost ruined everything. Fortunately, Kantaro's real name had not been revealed, and Yamato had used his money to stop the complaint. He bitterly regretted having taken on this terrible character, of whom he himself was almost afraid. Everything was compromised now... if they had made a mistake, there would be no time for research!... and, even if the brave man's ingenious conjecture was true, it was rather a disaster, for the news had been distressing: nothing remained of the Ako family, already reduced before the revolution, and extinguished completely in the horrors of the civil war.
Yamato wasn't sure why he was going to Ako Castle, in front of which the junk had been zigzagging for hours without being able to land. The fortress and its outbuildings now belonged to an old nobleman who had bought back the confiscated estate and repaired the damage.
Perhaps the old man could provide valuable information on the obscure and little-known history of the lords of yesteryear. Yamato was decidedly unfamiliar with the young past; the famous sites reminded him of nothing, and the brave man, who, at the beginning of the journey, declaimed at every opportunity, having noticed his companion's ignorance, kept a contemptuous silence ever since.
Secretly, and by a quick means, Yamato had sent word of his visit to the new lord of Ako... the name of the daimio of Kama-Koura, he had no doubt, would open the doors of the residence wide.
He was certain of this when he saw a long boat, armed with ten rowers, break away from the shore. They were coming to the rescue of the heavy junk, captive of the too calm sea. The passengers happily abandoned the junk to its slumber.
As he crossed the drawbridge and entered the castle gates, Oï-Kantaro could not contain his enthusiasm. His arms were raised to the sky, his face lit up.
- I'm contemplating you at last, famous walls! I am treading on the sacred floor, where the nervous footsteps of the faithful avengers resound!
- What's the matter with him now?" moaned Yamato softly; "he's going to make fools of us!
The brave man looked down at him protectively.
- You don't seem to remember," he said, "that the loyal vassals left this castle to avenge their lord who was forced to kill himself.
- By the way, I wasn't thinking about that," said Yamato.
- I won't insult you by saying that you don't know this glorious story.
- Who doesn't know the story of the forty-seven Ronines by heart?" replied the young man, shrugging his shoulders. - he added quietly.
- You see," continued the brave man, "how a good death makes you live a long life! It will soon be two hundred years since these heroes accomplished their noble suicide, and their memory shines on, even through the horrible smoke of the present day, which obscures everything.
Their tombs on Spring Hill are a place of pilgrimage for the people of Tokio, and our Mikado, in the first year of his reign, bestowed the supreme honour on them by hanging the Golden Leaf from the tombstone. He was only seventeen then. How his heart has changed since then!
Yamato lengthened his stride, taking advantage of the daydream in which the Mikado's heart was plunging his companion, to escape the rest of the speech.
The daïmio was coming to meet his hosts. Yamato realised it was him when he saw all the servants bowing. He wanted to do the same, but the lord stopped him by holding out his hand. Ceremonial had definitely been done away with! The manners of the new master of the illustrious castle were of the utmost simplicity. There was nothing modern, however, about his attire; he wore a beautiful, supple gown of dark purple crepe, with gold threads embroidering salmon with jasper eyes rising from waterfalls. He was an old man, with a long, gentle face, whose whole person breathed, to the highest degree, that dreamy nonchalance, which idleness of body and culture of mind, give to so many princes, recluse in their domains. He seemed very kind, or very indifferent; living within himself, slow to understand external things. He had been happy with the new state of things, which, by taking away the sovereignty of the lords, at the same time took away all their burdens, duties and worries, leaving them to live, rich and peaceful, entirely devoted to their dream. Yamato, walking slowly beside the prince, explained to him the cause and purpose of his visit, and how it no longer even had a purpose, since Ako's family had died out.
The daïmio listened absent-mindedly, stopping to pick flowers.
Oï-Kantaro marvelled at the beauty of the park, the blue vistas, the light bridges of red lacquer curving over clear rivers, on which thousands of marvellous birds floated.
We climbed up to a veranda, then entered the cool half-light of a room, where we squatted on padded embroidered velvet tiles.
Pretty servants immediately brought tea, which they offered on their knees.
The wood panelling was exquisitely decorated in the sweetest shades. But on the elegant tokonoma, whose legs were formed by two ironwood dragons, a gleaming bronze clock from Europe rounded the crisp whiteness of its dial, and along the delicate walls, two armchairs and four chairs howled cruelly with the fiery currant hue of their brocaded satin.
The daïmio, misunderstanding the look with which Oï-Kantaro struck these barbaric pieces of furniture, apologised for not using them.
- The foreigners are undoubtedly extremely small," he said; "only children can cross their legs on the armchairs and you lose your balance on the chairs.
Yamato explained that you have to sit with your legs dangling, which surprised the prince greatly.
- It makes your feet swell and must be very unhealthy," he said.
Then he fell silent, reflecting on the story of the stolen little girl, which did not awaken any memory in him. But hadn't he bought all the servants in the castle with it? Many of them must still be alive, at the time of the fire. He called his steward, who did not bat an eyelid at the strange order to bring all the old men and women who served on the estate before the prince.
Soon they arrived in small groups, shivering in their brown robes or half-naked, with dirt on their fingers or strands of thatch in their hair. The older ones had dishevelled white hair. The women hastily tied a piece of blue cotton under their chin, the faded azure of which made their old parchment-like faces appear even more yellow.
But all these people, as soon as they saw the lord, rushed off on all fours, foreheads to the ground, and all that could be seen were their backs and necks.
They were made aware of the situation and questioned, but no response or movement was forthcoming. Convinced that they were suspected of some serious offence, they did not understand what was being asked of them, and their foreheads remained stubbornly riveted to the floor.
- Don't worry," said the Prince, in a gentle voice; "I have never mistreated anyone; why are you trembling so much?
No one was reassured, no one broke the pious silence.
Finally, an old embroiderer, who had come in last, not yet knowing what it was all about, gave a shout when she saw the little dress, with its woven feathers, that the steward was stretching out by the sleeves at the end of his two hands.
- I sewed it myself!" she cried; "I sewed it with these old fingers of mine, which were young then. Yes, yes, I sewed it, this little dress, for the dear, divine Rosée de l'Aube, the last princess of Ako, burnt in the terrible fire!
And she held out her arms, begging to be allowed to touch the little garment with her forehead.
- I'm not lying," she said; "I've even kept some pieces of the cloth, which I'll be able to find again.
Kantaro was triumphant. Yamato, very moved, bowed to him, saying half-heartedly:
- Your sagacity has been truly marvellous and fills me with admiration.
- If the dress was saved from the fire, then so was the child wearing it," said the prince. Does anyone remember a rumour of betrayal, of a secret crime? Shake off your old memories and answer.
A few brows rose. An old man with a scraggly beard, his voice still choked with fear, spoke: One of his relatives, who had since died, had seen an unknown man climb over the window and come out of a burning pavilion, carrying the little princess who was screaming and struggling. It was to save her, he thought. But as she was never heard from again, and when they came to bury the remains of the dead, they found no trace of a child's corpse, the idea of a criminal abduction occurred to many. But they didn't dare mention it.
Other voices were heard; people were reassured and everyone, out of zeal, wanted to say something. Soon there was a jumbled cackle of naive and clumsy expressions; then the voices rose to dominate one another. All spoke at once, hands on the ground, heads raised, volubly recounting things that no one could hear; it became an extraordinary din that could no longer be stopped, like the wild barking of a pack.
The steward unbuckled his belt and, using it as a whip, drove off the frantic herd with light blows, which scattered in all directions and then, in an instant, disappeared.
XV
THE SILK BELT
"I will wait for you, my beloved, in an inaccessible place where my love will be out of reach.
"My young body, which was your delight, I must sacrifice to keep my soul for you.
"Let your tears flow at the memory of its voluptuous graces, so soon destroyed:
"Then raise your eyes to what survives, and smile at me through the clouds.
This is how L'Oiseau-Fleur ends her long poem, her testament of love. For her, it's all over. Her freedom has come to an end.
At the end of the day, she must be introduced to her new lover, whom she can only reject by offering him a dead woman. Everything in her home has been meticulously searched, everything that could be used as a weapon has been removed, even the metal pins for the hairstyles; but she has managed to hide the dagger, the young prince's wedding present. She didn't want to hit herself with any other weapon.
- Try to get it to him when it is red with my blood," she said to Broc d'Or; he will wipe it from his lips and thank him for helping me to keep my oath.
- The prince won't survive you," replied the maid, "and neither will I, and Lord Yamato will die too. All these lives are in your hands, which is why I beg you not to hasten the terrible outcome by a second, but rather to delay it to the very end.
- So you still hope? Dear madwoman. It would have taken Lord Yamato years to find, perhaps, some clues to my origin. What could he have done, without any information, across the whole empire?... Go on, death is already enveloping me; I can feel it in the cold that runs through my blood and in the great calm that comes over me after these months of anxious waiting. But I forbid you to die; you will live to carry out my last wishes, to bid farewell to my beloved prince, and to mourn me with him.
Broc d'Or made no reply, but his furrowed brows and staring eyes showed the obstinacy of his will.
L'Oiseau-Fleur enclosed her poem and a long letter in a pretty box, which she closed with a skilfully tied silk cord.
Several oirans came to see her. Ko-Mourasaki guessed that she had resolved to die, and her silence approved. Young Willow, for her part, was of the opinion that it was necessary to resign herself to the sacrifice, as infidelity does not kill love in men, but rather excites it. The others, preoccupied with their own intrigues or interests, did not seem to be aware of the drama, the denouement of which was very close.
Night fell. The kameleos went upstairs to dress the princess. They wore the rich toilet from the interview, the magnificent kimono in light purple satin embroidered with gold turtles, which Hana-Dori had not worn since the evening of her short-lived wedding.
- It pleases me to die in these clothes," she said in Broc d'Or's ear.
Broc d'Or was mentally praying fervently to the goddess Benten, whose golden statuette shone in a corner in the light of the small lamp, as she dressed her mistress with hands made clumsy by an invincible trembling.
She couldn't fasten the supple belt, which fell down at the front; she made a double knot where only a buckle was needed.
- Let it go," said Flower Bird, "you'll have to take it off now, because, since I'm certainly of noble blood, I'll die the death of the nobles, by cutting open my belly, gloriously.
The kameleos didn't leave once they had finished grooming; they had to wait, as they could be seen to be spies for the Dancing Stork.
Suddenly, the sound of an arrival was heard on the ground floor.
Stansiro (prostrate yourself), indicating a lord of importance.
- Come down, all of you," ordered the princess to the maids, in a tone that brooked no objections.
- Quick, quick, Broc d'Or," she continued, as soon as they had gone; "undo my belt.
The blade of the dagger was already gleaming out of its scabbard, but the belt resisted; with his feverish hands, Broc d'Or only succeeded in further tangling the knot. L'Oiseau-Fleur tried to help him, stamping her feet in anguish. Tears filled her beautiful eyes.
- To the heart, then, to the heart," she moaned, "since noble death is denied me.
She raised her arm... but Broc d'Or held it back with a cry of joy. Yamato had just appeared in the suddenly opened panel.
He saw the situation, and, trembling with fear and happiness, threw himself at the Flower Bird's knees, took hold of her belt and raised it to his forehead.
- Noble princess of Ako, well worthy of your birth," he said
I greet you with tears.
An old lord appeared in his turn, revealing a whole escort behind him. He stood in stunned admiration in front of the young woman, so pale and beautiful, almost swooning in the jolt that had so suddenly thrown her from death to happiness.
- You see, my lord," said Yamato, "I wasn't exaggerating. Two more seconds and it was all over. Rather than be unfaithful, your noble daughter was going to kill herself.
- Are you my father?" asked Flower Bird, trembling.
- No, my child, not yet," he said, "but I will be if you want me to be. You are the only survivor of this illustrious family that we thought was extinct. There is no longer any doubt; you are indeed the Princess of Ako, who has been kidnapped by criminals.
- Too thorough, and almost lost everything! whispered Yamato to Broc d'Or.
- I bought back your confiscated estates," continued the prince, "but since you are alive, I am usurping them morally. I can return them to you, by inheritance, by adopting you as my daughter.
To do that, I need your consent. Do you want me as your father?
The Princess of Ako threw herself at the old lord's feet, sobbing. He lifted her gently and said kindly:
- Dry this dew of tears quickly, my daughter, and smile at the lovely name that is yours: Dawn Dew.
Broc d'Or clapped her hands together.
- What does destiny have to do with it? If my clumsiness hadn't tangled the knot of this belt, we wouldn't now be wiping tears of joy from our cheeks. The minute we spent trying to untie what we couldn't, that's what gave happiness the time to happen!
